1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,200


2
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,603
 

3
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,064
 

4
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,748
 

5
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:03,200
 

6
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,867
 Jung I Sin. 

7
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,367
 I feel like the blood of that monster
who gave birth to me 

8
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,333
 is flowing through my veins. 

9
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:33,000
Jung Yeon, are you okay?

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Yeah, I'm fine.

11
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,300
Just feeling a bit queasy.

12
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:12,467
 

13
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,867
Excuse me.

14
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,167
- I'll go ahead first. 
 - Okay.

15
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:33,433
Excuse me, but where are you going?

16
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,000
To the funeral home.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,633
But she has a driver's license, right?

18
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,333
Yes.

19
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,767
What about compensation?

20
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,233
Mister...

21
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,300
I know this must be hard for you,

22
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,233
but please come here for just a moment...

23
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,033
Let go, you punk!

24
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:46,367
You killed an innocent man...

25
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,233
What about compensation?

26
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,633
Who's going to compensate us?

27
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,033
- Mister.
- You need to give us compensation.

28
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:00,067
Let go, you punk!

29
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,500
You need to compensate us.

30
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,667
What was your relationship with the deceased?

31
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,100
We, uh...

32
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm his older brother.

33
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Oh dear, such a young life lost...

34
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,600
The happiest time of Min Jae's life

35
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,900
was right here, at this very spot.

36
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,167
This is beautiful.

37
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,733
He drew this so well.

38
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,133
Did Min Jae draw this?

39
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,067
You and her?

40
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,867
Isn't it strange?

41
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm her biological son and can't stand seeing her,

42
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,300
but that brat with no blood relation

43
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,867
missed her so much.

44
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,833
What does blood relation matter?

45
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,100
What's important is how you feel about each other.

46
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,900
It's just...

47
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I don't know.

48
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,467
I've been running away since childhood.

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,033
From my past

50
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,200
and from my mother.

51
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:51,533
Always worried that someone
might find out about my past.

52
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:56,100
I guess I got tired from worrying

53
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:01,633
if I had to live like this forever.

54
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,467
This case.

55
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,267
I joined the investigation team this time

56
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,933
because Mom requested it,

57
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,833
but I guess

58
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:17,900
I also wanted to try it myself.

59
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:27,400
I wanted to really confront it
this time, to fight head-on,

60
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,000
but in the end, it turned out I ran away again.

61
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,833
Ran away?

62
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,767
Investigations are

63
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,900
a lot like children.

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,300
The more you're obsessed with them,

65
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,233
the more they go astray.

66
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,833
What do you mean?

67
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:59,867
I quit the investigation team.

68
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,933
Nothing has changed.

69
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:28,700
You're the one I've watched for a long time and chose.

70
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,067
You didn't run away.

71
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,567
Look at this view.

72
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,300
You came to a better place.

73
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,333
I'm sorry, I...

74
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,867
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,333
It's okay.

76
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:03,033
Let's go. A Ra actually hates dogs, you know?

77
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,733
She's just pretending otherwise.

78
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,900
Hey, guys!

79
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,133
Isn't he adorable?

80
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,767
Wow, he's following me!

81
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:25,367
A Ra, wake up. We're here.

82
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:31,000
Jung Yeon. Wipe her mouth over there.

83
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,733
I wasn't drooling.

84
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,100
You're so mean, seriously.

85
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,033
I'm going home now.

86
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,033
- Hurry and watch your step. 
 - Okay.

87
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,900
- I'll go up first. 
 - Okay.

88
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:52,767
I'll bring the luggage down. Wait a moment.

89
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,000
Take your time.

90
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,167
- Yes.
 - Why are didn't you answer your calls? 

91
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,400
You were right.

92
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,533
 I found that doctor's residence you mentioned. 

93
00:09:07,533 --> 00:09:10,500
I think he also knew Kang Yeon Jung.

94
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,167
You can catch your killer now.

95
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,567
No...

96
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,867
All the computers and files
in the doctor's house are gone.

97
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:20,000
That punk must've been really desperate this time.

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,667
No mirrors or anything. The place is a total mess.

99
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,100
 Return to the office immediately. 

100
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,133
Jung I Sin won't cooperate without you.

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,933
Both me and Jung I Sin can't help anymore.

102
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,067
If we wait a bit longer, the killer will call.

103
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,500
We need to find clues there.

104
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:42,767
Son Hyeon Ho definitely died because of me.

105
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,267
And Min Jae died because of me, too.

106
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,933
It's natural the team members
don't want me around.

107
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:52,267
I'm sorry, Section Chief.

108
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,033
 Su Yeol. 

109
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,367
As for the team members,

110
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,900
Jung I Sin will handle that herself.

111
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,033
What?

112
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,900
 Unless you don't want to catch the killer, 

113
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,167
return to the office right now.

114
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:13,000
You need to go, right?

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
Ah, well...

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,533
Go. It's okay.

117
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,133
Jung Yeon.

118
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:26,867
Su Yeol, you said investigations
are like children.

119
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:32,133
But children aren't just abandoned
and picked up again whenever you want.

120
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,967
Go. Go catch that copycat killer.

121
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,600
And then come pick me up.

122
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,767
They're agitated now.

123
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,833
They're trying to erase the traces.

124
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:57,633
Team Leader Cha Su Yeol has been
excluded from the investigation.

125
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,967
If you don't want to cooperate, return to prison.

126
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:09,133
I'll go back. Please make arrangements.

127
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,733
Why did it have to be your son?

128
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,000
After no contact for over 20 years, why now?

129
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:34,467
Could you please step aside for a moment?

130
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,833
That would be okay, right?

131
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,067
The custody lawsuit.

132
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
The child was so young,

133
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,100
and with a disability too,

134
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,567
there's no way the mother could have lost...

135
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,467
How did you know that?

136
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,633
The guy from the district office.

137
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,567
He just kept telling me everything
even though I didn't ask.

138
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,467
Why did you lose the case?

139
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,233
 Ho Jun, it's okay. 

140
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,567
 You don't have to answer anymore, okay? 

141
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,500
 It's okay, Ho Jun. Don't worry. 

142
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,333
 Ho Jun, our Ho Jun, yeah? 

143
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Ho Jun. No, it's fine. 

144
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
 You don't have to talk, okay? 

145
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,900
 It's okay. Dad's sorry, alright? 

146
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,767
The child chose his father.

147
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,600
At his age, the child's wishes
don't really affect the court's decision.

148
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,300
You know that, right?

149
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,533
 Da... 

150
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,433
 Da... Dad. 

151
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,033
 Dad. 

152
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:10,800
 - Dad.
- Dad? 

153
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,267
 Dad. 

154
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,100
 Good job. 

155
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,700
 Good job. 

156
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,933
Whether crying or screaming,

157
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:25,100
he only knew to smile when happy,
and couldn't even say a proper word.

158
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,533
Ho Jun said 'Dad'.

159
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,500
His first word since birth was 'Dad'.

160
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:37,433
You asked anyway, even knowing
it would work against you, right?

161
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,267
You wanted the child to choose
his father, didn't you?

162
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:51,233
Because you weren't confident you could handle it.

163
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:55,967
But, when it actually happened,
you felt horrible, right?

164
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,200
Because it made you the mother
who abandoned her own child.

165
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,267
Ms. Jung I Sin.

166
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:05,167
My son, Detective Cha Su Yeol,

167
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:08,667
became a cop to prove he's different from me.

168
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,133
And he took on this case to prove it.

169
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:15,233
If he fails to solve this,
he'll never forgive himself.

170
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:20,267
That's why he endures this awful mother
and didn't press emergency bells.

171
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,333
He just wants to catch criminals.

172
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,600
But, this is just a job for you too, isn't it?

173
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,633
You already gave up your child. If you fail
at the job as well, then you're nothing.

174
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:38,000
You won't be able to
forgive yourself either. Right?

175
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,367
What exactly are you trying to say?

176
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,733
Bring Su Yeol here!

177
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,433
He's just as desperate as you are.

178
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:47,967
Try working together, you desperate.

179
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,167
Inspector Cha Su Yeol.

180
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:02,267
He's a good cop.

181
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:05,033
Perfectly capable as our team leader.

182
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,867
We didn't reject him for being your son.

183
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,267
But it's because he hid it.

184
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,133
We're rejecting him because he didn't trust us.

185
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,433
That's right.

186
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,533
I was cowardly, yes.

187
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,433
I gave up.

188
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,400
Because I lacked confidence.

189
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:30,033
Rather than being a bad mother to Ho Jun,

190
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:35,900
I thought to excel where I could be useful.

191
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,267
But, Ms. Jung I Sin,

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,133
at least I didn't embrace my child
with hands that chopped bodies apart.

193
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,833
If you had any maternal love, no,

194
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,900
if you had any sense of responsibility,

195
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,400
shouldn't you have stopped for the child's sake?

196
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,800
You cut out someone's tongue,
ripped open a throat,

197
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,520
and then went home to your kid.

198
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,300
What was going through your head?

199
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:07,933
Was it something like,
'I'm a mother, so I won't kill you'?

200
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,467
How articulate.

201
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,667
You're furious.

202
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,767
I'm just curious.

203
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,200
Are you helping this investigation

204
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:21,767
because of Cha Su Yeol, for your son's sake?

205
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,700
What?

206
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,567
I can't trust you.

207
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,600
If this isn't about helping your son,

208
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,100
but about some ulterior motive to use him...

209
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,567
Vicious criminals always do that.

210
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,167
If that's the case,

211
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,300
I'll kill you myself.

212
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,033
Inspector Kim Na Hui.

213
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,500
Stay strong.

214
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:28,167
 

215
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,733
The soup was spicy enough,
but they went overboard with the cilantro...

216
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,133
Hyuk.

217
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:07,133
 Lying about that was wrong. 

218
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:28,067
Why the long face?

219
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,700
Didn't things go well with Su Yeol
at the funeral yesterday?

220
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,467
I don't know.

221
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:39,333
I don't know... I really don't.

222
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,667
You two make being single
look like the best thing ever...

223
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,800
How about some day-drinking?

224
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,467
A Ra. I can't drink anymore.

225
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,133
Why?

226
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,400
What's wrong?

227
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:00,933
Come on, tell me, okay?

228
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:16,367
Wait... No way. Seriously?

229
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:18,533
This is amazing news, Jung Yeon.

230
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,900
It's happy news. Why the hesitation?

231
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,933
Don't tell me Su Yeol's against it?

232
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,333
Should I teach that Cha Su Yeol a lesson?

233
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,400
Want me to give him a piece of my mind?

234
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,767
No, he doesn't know yet.

235
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,500
Why haven't you told him?

236
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,133
Jung Yeon.

237
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:43,584
I don't care anymore.

238
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:46,300
I confessed first, proposed first,

239
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,400
and I'll have this baby
whether he wants it or not.

240
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,333
I'll make him see

241
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,467
how wonderful family can be.

242
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,800
How enviable.

243
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,100
Huh?

244
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,667
No, no.

245
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,933
Let's get some fresh air.

246
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:21,400
This is ASTRO Ji An,

247
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,167
a character created by Officer Song.

248
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:35,367
I didn't come expecting welcome.

249
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:39,367
But, until this investigation
concludes, we should...

250
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,333
Cooperate.

251
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,967
We need to catch the killer.

252
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,033
No more victims.

253
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,133
Thank you.

254
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:53,300
Remember what you told us
when you first arrived here?

255
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,533
Whether narcotics or violent crimes,

256
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:58,633
real cops solve through investigation.

257
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,500
Now, give us that answer.

258
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,400
We'll give ours, too.

259
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,300
 

260
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,233
 Why team up with cops? For your son? 

261
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:27,167
Know what I'm looking at?

262
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,667
A corpse in a bathtub.

263
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,967
 Completely random. 

264
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,933
 Not even killing those who deserved it. 

265
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,467
 You killed to save yourself. 

266
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,967
 I know who you really are. 

267
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,133
Get it now?

268
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,133
You're different from me.

269
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:45,267
You kill because you want to kill.

270
00:22:45,267 --> 00:22:47,767
No reason needed.

271
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,200
 That cat you showed me when you were little, 

272
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,967
you killed it.

273
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,000
 You took out what your father did to you 

274
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,733
on a small, helpless animal.

275
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,300
 That's who you are, Yeon Jung. 

276
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,800
If you have a kid,

277
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,833
you'll do to them
what your father did to you, huh?

278
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,633
 Shut up! Before I rip your mouth open! 

279
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:13,567
Wow, those two together are brutal.

280
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,367
 Right, Jung I Sin. 

281
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:18,033
 You should've killed me when you killed Dad. 

282
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:22,133
 You strut around like some righteous hero, 

283
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,433
 but you're just a failed monster. 

284
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,567
 Ungrateful punk. How dare you. 

285
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:30,033
 That punk Park Min Jae's been
digging into you and your son. 

286
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,667
 I stopped all that. 

287
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,733
 Your son's happy now, 

288
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:35,633
 all because of me. 

289
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:38,300
 But how dare you. 

290
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,967
What's that supposed to mean?

291
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,300
 Fine, I'll make you regret it 

292
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,467
 for not killing me along with Dad. 

293
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,467
 You're in prison, 

294
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:50,167
 and I'm out here. 

295
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:55,333
 Watch closely how the things you cherished
get destroyed, one by one. 

296
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,733
They said you are happy because of them.

297
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,900
How did you meet Jung Yeon?

298
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,900
 I always thought detectives were scary people. 

299
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,733
 Huh? I'm actually terrifying. 

300
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 Oh, you know. I get pretty intense
when I'm working, that sort of thing. 

301
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:44,800
 I kinda hope you're scared of me, Su Yeol. 

302
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,900
 Why's that? 

303
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,667
 Because it's scary, liking someone. 

304
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,933
 Hey, why are there so many people in the bathroom? 

305
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,067
 What's going on? 

306
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:02,133
 What's going on? I just stepped out.
Why's the vibe so weird? 

307
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,867
 What's with the first-day drama? 

308
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:05,800
 You're not gonna tell me? 

309
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,633
Hey, it's fine. Don't worry, okay?

310
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,033
Safe driving's what matters most.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,133
 
 The phone is powered off... 

312
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:07,033
 The phone is powered off,
connecting to voicemail... 

313
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:11,700
Team Leader. No one's inside the house.

314
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,000
No car either. Seems like they've moved somewhere.

315
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,733
You know her, right? Anywhere she might go?

316
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:24,267
Hey! Watch how you drive!

317
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,967
The vehicle passed Yeoseung Toll Gate.

318
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,267
If it's Yeoseung, where are they heading?

319
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,500
What about Ms. Lee Jung Yeon's phone?

320
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,567
Still turned off.

321
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:42,267
 The phone is powered off,
connecting to voicemail... 

322
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,033
All patrol cars and the highway
control center have been alerted.

323
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,800
These days most patrol cars
are smart units, so they'll track it fast.

324
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,533
Don't worry too much.

325
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,300
 

326
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:14,933
Parking.

327
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,400
How is it? Trustworthy now, right?

328
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,233
A Ra, should we call a designated driver?

329
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:24,133
No, no I can do this, I can.

330
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,067
I'm just going to fill up on gas, okay?

331
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,767
Okay.

332
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,067
Why is it turned off?

333
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,433
 

334
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,267
Lee Jung Yeon's phone is back on.

335
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,433
It's pinging near Ichang-myeon.

336
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:03,467
Send nearby units there immediately.

337
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,567
 

338
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,933
Go past Ichang-myeon,
and take Highway 92 directly.

339
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:13,633
Understood.

340
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:25,867
What?

341
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,600
Oh, I need to use the bathroom.

342
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,233
All patrol vehicles in the area now...

343
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:47,800
Wait.

344
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,967
Yes, Su Yeol.

345
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,033
 Hey, Jung Yeon. 

346
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,367
I'll explain later.

347
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,767
 If you're with A Ra, get away as fast as you can. 

348
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,033
 Go somewhere crowded. 

349
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:59,300
And I'm on my way, so don't worry.

350
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,367
 Can you tell me where you are? 

351
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,700
Myeongcheon Self-Service Gas Station.

352
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,833
Yes, Jung Yeon.

353
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:11,267
Don't turn off your phone, and leave it as it is.

354
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,267
- Alright.
 - Don't panic. 

355
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:16,333
 Stay calm, and go to crowded places. 

356
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,600
 Don't hang up. Jung Yeon, got it? 

357
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:49,733
How cute you are, our Jung Yeon.

358
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:13,267
 

359
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,933
Hello! Anyone here?

360
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,100
Yeah, Su Yeol, it's me.

361
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,767
 I escaped. 

362
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,633
Jung Yeon, good job. Are you okay?

363
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,600
But, what's happening? Su Yeol.

364
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,704
 Is A Ra really the killer? 

365
00:30:48,704 --> 00:30:49,967
Yeah, seems like it.

366
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:53,533
Police are heading there now.
Don't worry, I'm coming too.

367
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:56,267
 Where exactly are you now? 

368
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:59,400
This place is... Giseung Logistics.

369
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,033
 Giseung Logistics! 

370
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,333
But, there's no one around.

371
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,000
The police are on their way there now.

372
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,167
 I'm coming too, don't worry. 

373
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,867
Take a deep breath.

374
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,300
One.

375
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,333
Two.

376
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:21,833
 Three. 

377
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:25,233
 One, two, 

378
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,567
three.

379
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,767
Su Yeol, someone's here.

380
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:40,033
Ms. Lee Jung Yeon!

381
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,867
Ms. Lee Jung Yeon!

382
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,600
Is Ms. Lee Jung Yeon here?

383
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:46,133
It's the police.

384
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,900
 H... Here! 

385
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,967
Yes, we found Ms. Lee Jung Yeon!

386
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
- I'm here.
- Oh, yes.

387
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,833
Yes, go ahead.

388
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,133
 Good work today. 

389
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:00,032
First, take her to a safe location.

390
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:02,000
We'll be there shortly.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
Understood.

392
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,700
Get in the back.

393
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
We'll escort you to safety.

394
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,900
We're heading to the district office immediately.

395
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:20,967
 
 Hello? 

396
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:22,633
Jung Yeon, what's wrong?

397
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:28,500
Jung Yeon!

398
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,867
Step on it! Quick!

399
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,467
Yes.

400
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,400
 1223, 1223, respond! 

401
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,167
 1223, what's happening? 

402
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,167
 1223, answer me! 

403
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,867
Jung Yeon.

404
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,160
A Ra, please don't do this.

405
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,433
I... I'm pregnant. There's a baby.

406
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,333
Hi, nice to meet you.

407
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,433
I'm Kang Yeon Jung.

408
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,733
The handgun is missing.

409
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,367
Team Leader.

410
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,567
Hello?

411
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,000
 Hello? 

412
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,733
Is that Su Yeol?

413
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,500
A Ra, you...

414
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,567
Inspector Cha Su Yeol.

415
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,733
No, wait. Jeong Ho.

416
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,467
 It's been a while. 

417
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,133
Kang Yeon Jung.

418
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,967
Jung Yeon is sleeping peacefully.

419
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,567
 When Jung Yeon wakes up,
her world will be hell anyway. 

420
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:17,033
I hope she's having sweet dreams.

421
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,633
Don't you dare touch Jung Yeon.

422
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:24,667
Su Yeol. She was a toy
I gave you in the first place.

423
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,800
Who are you to say that to my face?

424
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,600
Oh, right. I left you a little present.

425
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,767
 Check that console box. 

426
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,800
Surprise!

427
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,000
We've located the suspect's
vehicle. The direction...

428
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,067
 

429
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,233
Su Yeol.

430
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,400
The killer seems to be heading toward Woongsan.

431
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,767
 She's not even trying to hide her tracks. 

432
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,333
The mining town where Kang Yeon Jung
lived, and my old home...

433
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,400
 Please send units to every place she might go. 

434
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,733
Also, block Yeonpo Bridge.

435
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:09,433
Team Leader, since Hyeopseong Mine closed down,

436
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,533
nobody lives in the company housing anymore.

437
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,967
Your old Yeonpo residence is also empty.

438
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:19,133
What about Yeonpo Bridge?

439
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,633
It's been blocked earlier,
and no one's crossed it.

440
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:24,700
They are probably somewhere in this neighborhood.

441
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,833
We contacted the mining company.

442
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:32,667
Told the advance SWAT team
to gather at the welfare center.

443
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,400
Let's head there.

444
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,633
You're awake?

445
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,533
How do you like this place?

446
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,433
Cozy, right?

447
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:59,133
It's my favorite spot.

448
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,633
Not sure how you'll feel about it.

449
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,700
A Ra, it's me. Jung Yeon.

450
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,300
I know, Jung Yeon.

451
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,367
Cha Su Yeol's wife, Jung I Sin's daughter-in-law.

452
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,100
I introduced you to Su Yeol.

453
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,700
Honestly, I tried matching him with others before.

454
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,500
But he only got interested in you.

455
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,767
I even know your door code.

456
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:25,000
Through you, I hear Cha Su Yeol's stories daily.

457
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,667
Didn't even need CCTV.

458
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,133
All thanks to you.

459
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,733
Why would you...

460
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,600
Since that woman looked out for me,

461
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,067
shouldn't I help her son in return?

462
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,633
That... that woman?

463
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,267
Hey.

464
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:48,267
Jeez, get a grip, Jung Yeon!

465
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:54,133
Might meet your mother-in-law soon. Act decent!

466
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,333
- Team Leader.
- Yes.

467
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,033
Wait.

468
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,567
Yes, Section Chief.

469
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,300
Answer it.

470
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,533
 Hello, shut up and listen. 

471
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,167
 Wanna know where we are? 

472
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,900
Let's call it my hideout.

473
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,533
It's buggy and damp here,

474
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,400
 but I love here. 

475
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,733
- The basement storage...
 - Whenever Dad went on his drunken rants, 

476
00:38:57,733 --> 00:38:59,900
 I used to hide here. 

477
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,333
Ta-da.

478
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,333
 At this desk, I'd play doctor. 

479
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,567
Used a box cutter as my scalpel.

480
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:14,667
 I dissected everything, from stray cats
and dogs to small animals. 

481
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:17,900
Yeah, even that cat I showed you back then.

482
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,233
 I was the one who killed it. 

483
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,167
It felt thrilling to do something Dad hated.

484
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,333
 You know that feeling, right? 

485
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:29,633
 Later, whether my dad liked it or not,
I just wanted to do it. 

486
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,300
 From small things to big ones, 

487
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,267
 from animals to humans. 

488
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,767
Seriously...

489
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,900
I should've killed him myself back then.

490
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,300
That part still haunts me.

491
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,133
 Once, I was so curious I even thought
about dissecting a pregnant animal. 

492
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:06,200
-  You know, if you anesthetize the mother, 
- Hang on.

493
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,767
 does it affect the baby too? 

494
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:11,133
I was so curious about that.

495
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,833
 So, I've been searching every corner of this town, 

496
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:18,167
 but didn't see any pregnant animals around. 

497
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,200
 Maybe because it was such a remote rural area. 

498
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:24,233
I've dissected almost everything.

499
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:26,133
But, not that yet.

500
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,367
But today, I can finally do it.

501
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,000
 Still acting like a kid? 

502
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,400
 Back then, you took out your anger at your father 

503
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:42,633
on animals because you were weak.

504
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,533
But, not anymore, huh?

505
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,800
 If you're mad at me, take it out on me. 

506
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,600
What you really want is me.

507
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Not the toy I gave you, right?

508
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:06,800
 Hey, Jung Yeon. Your mother-in-law
called you a toy? 

509
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:15,133
 I told you to shut your mouth. 

510
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,967
Our Jung Yeon...

511
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,867
owes her life to her mother-in-law.

512
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,400
 I'll send her back safely 

513
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,233
 but you have to come here yourself. 

514
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:36,033
 Exchange time is in five hours.
Location is the welfare center. 

515
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:39,900
 And after that? I'll tell you once you come. 

516
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,367
If I catch even a glimpse of the cops,

517
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,633
I'll kill Jung Yeon.

518
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,333
 See you soon, Mom. 

519
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,733
Five hours from now...

520
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:53,900
That's 11 AM.

521
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,067
Jung I Sin's coming here?

522
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,467
Open your mouth.

523
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:35,033
Stop pretending to care. Untie me.

524
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:39,867
Our Jung Yeon isn't ready to be a mother, huh?

525
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,567
Is your kid okay right now?

526
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,167
Jeez!

527
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:58,233
Hey!

528
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:02,033
I tried to help, and you spit at me?

529
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,700
I'm all wet and dirty thanks to you!

530
00:43:08,467 --> 00:43:12,767
 

531
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:15,233
If you go, you'll die. You know that.

532
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:17,233
 Accept it. 

533
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,667
Trade one life for two.

534
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,700
 It's a good deal for you. 

535
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,167
 Last time, you said 

536
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,700
I should help with
the investigation to atone, right?

537
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,167
 How funny. 

538
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm a death row inmate anyway.

539
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:43,333
Even if I killed scum who deserved it,
I've already been judged.

540
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:48,300
But you...

541
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,933
What about me?

542
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,867
I have to do this.

543
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:07,533
 

544
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,933
 I get it. 

545
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:16,033
But, I can't decide.

546
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:23,800
Since the mine closed, there were
talks of casinos or whatever coming in,

547
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,500
but it all fell through.

548
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,267
Even the workers who were here

549
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:31,168
say no one knows the full layout of the mine.

550
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,856
Jeez. So what?

551
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:36,667
What's the point of bringing
all these people here?

552
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:38,400
We can't provoke the killer.

553
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,733
Just follow orders.

554
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,400
What about Team Leader?

555
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,733
His mother, wife, and now his kid...

556
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:53,300
I'd have lost my mind by now.

557
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,300
You are too naive.

558
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,533
Why?

559
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,267
I mean...

560
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,733
It's just... hard to say.

561
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,000
Never mind. Anyway...

562
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,267
If we blindly follow Kang Yeon Jung's orders,

563
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:18,067
both Jung I Sin and Kang Yeon Jung will walk free.

564
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,767
What if they're all in cahoots?

565
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,967
Honestly, I don't even trust Team Leader Cha.

566
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:30,500
You still think Team Leader Cha
is that kind of man?

567
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:35,467
He worked harder than anyone to catch criminals.

568
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:38,033
He suffered deeply with every victim.

569
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,800
Yeah, almost excessively so.

570
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,333
Now, I get it.

571
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,633
Jung I Sin said the team leader

572
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:49,967
became a cop to prove he's different from his mom
and took on this case for that reason.

573
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:52,200
To prove he's different?

574
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,267
I mean he wants to be a lifesaver, not a killer.

575
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:59,267
The one who saves people, the one who stops crime.

576
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:02,567
But, victims kept appearing.
He must've felt powerless.

577
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:06,000
Blaming himself for failing to stop it.

578
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,167
And on top of that, the suspect
was mimicking his mother's crimes,

579
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:13,700
so he was forced to relive the part of
his mother's past he didn't want to see.

580
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,700
Then, Team Leader

581
00:46:16,467 --> 00:46:18,900
must have felt so much pain.

582
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:23,900
Would someone like that even use his pregnant wife
to help Jung I Sin and Kang Yeon Jung?

583
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:26,900
No, I just...

584
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,033
Team Leader wouldn't do that.

585
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:32,400
I could understand if he were
being used by the two of them.

586
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,167
But if Jung I Sin is exploiting
Team Leader's feelings

587
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:41,167
and if the mother is not only a serial killer

588
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:44,233
but also trying to use her son to escape,

589
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:47,333
Team Leader's life has really...

590
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,867
That's why we need to focus.
For Team Leader's sake.

591
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:53,867
We need to see this through.

592
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,700
A hostage exchange?

593
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:59,533
The higher-ups would never approve that.

594
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:00,667
Just like you said,

595
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:03,100
there's no way the Commissioner would risk

596
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,433
releasing two serial killers.

597
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:13,700
Section Chief Choi.

598
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:17,000
Jung Ho, are you out of your mind?

599
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,433
How can you trust Jung I Sin to save that woman?

600
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:23,467
We'll plant a tracker on Jung I Sin
and arrest them when she meets the killer.

601
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:26,167
This is our best chance to catch the suspect.

602
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,633
Jung I Sin has agreed to cooperate.

603
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:31,567
What if they're working together?
What if they're accomplices?

604
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:35,633
What if this isn't a chance to catch the suspect,
but a chance for the Queen Mantis to escape?

605
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,400
As a precaution,

606
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:41,333
we should surround the hostage exchange location.

607
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,933
We'll take every measure to prevent their escape.

608
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,767
We're out of time.

609
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:52,367
If the pregnant woman dies
despite police involvement,

610
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:54,500
can you imagine the fallout?

611
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,833
We have only over four hours left.

612
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,167
We need to get Jung I Sin to the scene quickly.

613
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:05,333
Why did you even involve her in the first place?

614
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,400
Jung Ho, step back now.

615
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,333
I'll handle this myself from here.

616
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,700
No.

617
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,467
What?

618
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,567
I'll finish this with my own hands.

619
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,567
 We received a report that a child's screams
were coming from inside. 

620
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,900
 Can I go check inside? 

621
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:38,433
 You want to take in that kid? 

622
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:41,200
 No, don't say things like that... 

623
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,600
You know how it was with Kang Yeon Jung.

624
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,267
That day...

625
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,200
If I had forced my way into that house.

626
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:56,200
I could've found Kang Yeon Jung.

627
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,700
If I had taken proper action then,

628
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,500
the father wouldn't have been killed.

629
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,233
And Kang Yeon Jung wouldn't
have witnessed Jung I Sin murdering the father.

630
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:09,500
23 years later, Kang Yeon Jung

631
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,233
wouldn't have killed so many people
following in Jung I Sin's footsteps.

632
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,667
Why are you saying this?

633
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,700
You know how that town was.

634
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,833
One side demanded the mine stay open,

635
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,200
and the other wanted it closed to build a casino.

636
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,533
Every day they'd get drunk
and smash each other up.

637
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,067
That place was pure chaos.

638
00:49:34,067 --> 00:49:35,633
They'd fight right on the streets,

639
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:39,200
even in front of our police station!

640
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,800
Violence erupted constantly.

641
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,600
And as for beating their own kid at home...

642
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,267
Excuses!

643
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,033
All excuses.

644
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:56,567
No matter what, we failed our duty.

645
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:58,500
What we couldn't finish back then.

646
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:07,433
Now, I want to finish this with my own hands.

647
00:50:23,133 --> 00:50:25,567
 You know what the higher-ups are worried about? 

648
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,467
 They suspect she's an accomplice? 

649
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:34,033
So Kang Yeon Jung was trying
to get Jung I Sin out all this time?

650
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:37,967
Jung I Sin is the police's darkest secret.

651
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,367
 They'd thank us if she disappeared. 

652
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,133
Yes, understood.

653
00:51:02,433 --> 00:51:05,933
Then, I'll take it as permission
and move accordingly.

654
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,500
The vibe here's getting tense.

655
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,933
Who was it?

656
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:14,467
Special orders from the Commissioner.

657
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:18,733
From now on, we operate independently. Hyuk.

658
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:37,133
You tried to save me, didn't you?

659
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:40,400
Thank you.

660
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,344
But what does it feel like,

661
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:52,567
to truly try to save someone?

662
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:03,967
Now, let's go.

663
00:52:08,733 --> 00:52:11,800
 Even if I killed scum who deserved it, 

664
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,033
 I've already been judged. 

665
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,900
 I have to do this. 

666
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,067
Mother Bird, passing Woongsan Elementary now.

667
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,967
 

668
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,367
Get off now.

669
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:11,633
We'll stay here on standby,

670
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:13,433
and once the hostage exchange starts,

671
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:17,033
we'll move to these positions, here, here, here,

672
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:18,867
and track Kang Yeon Jung and Jung I Sin.

673
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:21,533
By the way, what was the Commissioner's
special instruction earlier?

674
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:24,933
'We don't need to arrest Kang Yeon Jung alive.'

675
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:27,000
'Just end this at all costs.'

676
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,133
Also, except for Lee Jung Yeon and Cha Su Yeol,

677
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:32,200
don't risk officers' lives to protect the hostage.

678
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,500
For the safety of Lee Jung Yeon and Cha Su Yeol,

679
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,000
to stop Kang Yeon Jung's crimes,

680
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,100
we can kill Jung I Sin if necessary.

681
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,767
That's the directive.

682
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,400
We'll communicate separately via channel 8.

683
00:55:50,033 --> 00:55:52,033
When Jung Yeon returns,

684
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,400
we'll start tracking immediately.

685
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:04,267
Give me your arm.

686
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,300
Forget it.

687
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,900
Kang Yeon Jung has a gun.

688
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,900
So, put it on.

689
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,600
There are plenty of people who want me dead,

690
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,500
not just Kang Yeon Jung.

691
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:24,900
Not me.

692
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,900
So, give me your arm.

693
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:34,733
I'll be nearby,

694
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,433
so don't worry.

695
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,133
 Head straight to the mountain
behind the second mine. 

696
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:58,800
Bring Queen Mantis handcuffed,
and you come unarmed.

697
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,767
 If anyone makes a move or tries anything funny, 

698
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,533
Jung Yeon and your kid die instantly.

699
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,767
We're ready.

700
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:19,200
 Baby Bird is leading Mother Bird out of the hall. 

701
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,733
 Starting to move. 

702
00:58:20,733 --> 00:58:23,767
Queen Mantis actually came.

703
00:58:41,533 --> 00:58:44,100
Chief Bae, you go first.

704
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,533
Move around the foot of
the mountain as wide as possible,

705
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:49,467
and check all buildings
and caves for hiding spots.

706
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:51,333
- Understood.
- Stay alert.

707
00:58:51,333 --> 00:58:54,133
Don't forget Kang Yeon Jung has a gun.

708
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,767
Roger that.

709
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:23,100
Once the exchange is complete,
we'll move immediately.

710
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,800
As soon as Jung Yeon is safe, take the shot.

711
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,800
I was so disappointed.

712
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,500
If you want to kill me, now's your only chance.

713
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,667
Tell me where Jung I Sin went.

714
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:36,333
Both are now on an undisclosed wanted list.

715
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,167
Why were you so kind to her?

716
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,467
And to me too.

717
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:43,333
That burned my mother alive.

718
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,167
Are you really not lonely?

719
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,367
Living as a monster.
