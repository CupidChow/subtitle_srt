[Hyeopseong Mine Housing Complex, Woongsan]

7
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,517
Uh, we received a report

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,084
that a child's screams were coming from inside.

9
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,467
Can I go check inside?

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,084
The kid wouldn't listen at all,

11
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:40,450
so I raised my voice a bit, and then
he started crying and begging.

12
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,484
Is that enough now?

13
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:42,950
No, we've gotten multiple calls...

14
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,317
I mean,

15
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,133
that kid never listens properly every single time.

16
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,867
Ah, what's the problem?

17
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,884
You want to take in that kid?

18
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,500
No, don't say things like that...

19
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,584
Unless someone is caught in the act,

20
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,017
the police don't have the authority
to force an investigation.

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,467
There's also no regulation
that punishes someone for refusing.

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
This way.

23
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:38,317
They said the little kid was just standing there,

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,133
looking at the body smiling.

25
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,784
Let's go to the police station with me.

26
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:03,917
Okay.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,667

00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:32,550
What were you doing around 7 PM yesterday?

30
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:36,733
You left work around 6...

31
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,917
The signal is coming through clearly.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,750
Once the hostage exchange is over,
all units will head straight to the exchange site.

33
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,584
Everyone, gather around the mountain.

34
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,717
No, wait.

35
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,417
The hostage's safety isn't confirmed yet.

36
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,284
We strike only when their safety is confirmed.

37
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,884
All units, hold positions and stand by.

38
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:26,533

Hyuk.

40
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,917
Circle behind the mountain and search
behind the second mine, right now.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,017
Copy that.

42
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,133

Ah, where is it?

44
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,700
Quite a few have arrived.

Once the exchange is complete,
we'll move immediately.

54
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:36,517

- Jung Yeon.
- Be careful.

00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,067
Remove the tracker.

65
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,600
Right. Guess so.

66
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,033
What the heck?

67
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,233
I'll check it out, and you head
to the hospital for now.

Entered miners' lounge. No one here.

Oh, yes. Tough luck.

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,250
How can we trust Jung I Sin's son?

77
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,600
Return immediately!

78
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,017
Yes, the test results

79
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,884
showed positive for mifepristone,
an abortion drug.

80
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:59,050
But, the dosage was low, so she'll be okay.

81
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,484
What about the baby?

82
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's check the baby.

83
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,267
That's the baby's heartbeat.

84
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,700
Heartbeat...

As soon as Jung Yeon is safe, take the shot.

91
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,350
Jung Yeon.

92
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:55,467
Do you remember anything

93
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,833
from when you were held there?

94
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,067
There was this really strong, foul metallic smell.

95
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,967
I also heard some creaking sounds.

96
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,700
It felt like some kind of windowless warehouse.

97
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,233
There were machine parts.

98
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,250
Ah, there was writing,

99
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,367
something like 'departure'...

100
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,400
What else?

101
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,584
King?

102
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:38,350
There was something written as 'King.'

103
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:42,733
Ah, the floor was old cement.

104
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,667
Yes, I could feel the cement dust.
I remember clearly.

105
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,467
Su Yeol.

106
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,317
Go find your mother.

107
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,333
A Ra is completely insane.

108
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:01,667
Mother is in danger.

109
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,567
You ended up bringing the police.

110
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:18,017
You know, I was so disappointed.

111
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,150
The old Queen Mantis only
worries about her own child.

112
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,500
Is a son really that important?

113
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:29,750
No, what do you even know about your son?

114
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,817
Your son treated you like you didn't exist.

115
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,150
Well, was it only your son?

116
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,317
Everyone in the world forgets you,
pretends you don't exist.

117
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,984
They've forgotten you.

118
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,984
Try forgetting too.

119
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,484
It feels so liberating.

120
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,617
Not bad at all.

121
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,333
No.

122
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:55,317
I'm the only one who hasn't forgotten you.

123
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,284
And I'm the only one who was proud of you.

124
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,750
The father who kept burning my nose
while claiming he'd cure my 'demon illness.'

125
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,517
You removed him from my life.

126
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,250
When you saw those beastly people
in the world, you punished them.

127
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,184
Isn't that insanely cool?

128
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:13,850
I loved it so much.

129
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:19,117
Like Joan of Arc

130
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,184
holding Medusa's head.

131
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,850
I followed you.

132
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,184
I became more like you.

133
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,984
I am you.

134
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,484
You created me.

135
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:35,433
So please, have some sense of responsibility, Mom.

136
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,067
Why did you do that?

137
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,484
What?

138
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:47,317
Hey. At least you should've loved me.

139
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,450
Dad thought I was a monster, but you saved me!

140
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:53,033
Why were you so irresponsible?

141
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,600
Are you really not lonely?

142
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,767
Living as a monster.

143
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:15,633
Never being able to return home, right?

144
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,517
It's okay.

145
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,084
I'll hold you.

146
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,500
I understand.

147
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:37,217
We can't go back to them people.

148
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,484
It's been too long since we crossed the line

149
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,184
that those miserable people set up.

150
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,533
I don't even know when or how it happened.

151
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,900
But I know this.

152
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,167
I, too, have nowhere to go,

153
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,967
just like you, Mom.

154
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,833
So let's not

155
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,250
betray each other, okay?

156
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,000
Mom.

157
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,700
It wasn't me who betrayed you.
Don't get it twisted.

158
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,717
- What?
- You were hunting prey on the app as Joy, right?

159
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,750
Only through there?

160
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,984
You were completely lazy.

161
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,917
After killing the prey,

162
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,050
you should've deleted
all their accounts, but you didn't.

163
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:15,150
That's how the police traced it back from there.

164
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:19,333
Your tail, you stretched it out yourself.

165
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,417
Yeah? Darn it.

166
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,817
The police will come.

167
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,133
Following your blood trail.

168
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,867
What? Are you worried about me?

169
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,867
Yeon Jung.

170
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:46,400
You brought me all the way
here just to confess your love?

171
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,350
There's no time.

172
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:54,933
If you want to kill me,
now's your only chance. Hurry up.

173
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,833
Really?

174
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,433
Fine.

175
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,933
You die, I die. Is that the plan?

176
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,584
I just thought about it

177
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,684
and yeah, this kind of ending

178
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,784
doesn't seem bad.

179
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,034
After all, I'm not afraid of anything

180
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:29,767
as long as I'm with you.

181
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:42,050
Darn it.

182
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,267
It hurts.

183
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,350
What are you looking for?

184
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,050
Save your breath.

185
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,450
There's not much time left.

186
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:24,633
Oh. Is Queen Mantis finally
going to tear me apart alive?

187
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,900
If the police arrive soon, you might live.

188
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,750
Not that it'll be easy.

189
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,600
Where are you going?

190
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,650
Don't go.

191
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,517
Are you abandoning me?

192
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,484
You know Joan of Arc wasn't
the one who cut Medusa's head.

193
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,984
Who cares who it was?

194
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:06,084
If you lose too much blood, you'll get cold fast.

195
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,900
They

196
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,467
were all shivering.

197
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,684
Are you going to prison?

198
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,600
Why? Why the heck?

199
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
Don't go.

200
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:25,317
Please don't go back.

201
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,284
There's a passage the police
don't know about. I found it.

202
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,617
I'll get you out of here without anyone noticing.

203
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,484
I'll show you.

204
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,050
I can give you freedom.

205
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,917
So, please...

206
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,567
Just run away. Please.

207
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,717
Annoying.

208
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,467
I'll take the main road.

209
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,233
Open it.

210
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,233
I told you.

211
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:40,850
I know who you are.

212
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:44,267
See? You haven't forgotten.

213
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,884
A machine parts warehouse?

214
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,967
[Expected Location]
There's no such warehouse near the mine.

215
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,884
This way. What is this place?

216
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:23,350
Oh, this was built during
the mine company's heyday as a resort.

217
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:27,767
But everything's ruined now.
Who knows what's left?

218
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:36,684
There was something written as 'King.'

219
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,467
King...

220
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,133
Viking?

221
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,850
Too late, huh?

222
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:32,317
Jung I Sin just went that way.

223
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,084
There's a secret passage there.

224
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:38,817
Where did she go? Did she go to prison?

225
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,117
Give up.

226
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,884
Even if you shoot me, you'll still get caught.

227
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,984
Everyone's coming here.

228
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:50,417
Tell me where Jung I Sin went.

229
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,384
Cha Su Yeol.

230
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:55,700
You know nothing about Jung I Sin.

231
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,550
You'll die clueless.

232
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,800
Goodbye, Cha Su Yeol.

233
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,867
Manager Kim!

234
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,300
What about Jung I Sin?

235
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:43,100
Gone. She vanished.

236
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,950
She said Jung I Sin escaped through
a secret passage. Let's get you...

237
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,050
Inspector Cha Su Yeol.

238
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,800
Go catch her. Bring Jung I Sin back.

239
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,933
Bring her in quickly.

240
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll bring her back. I promise.

[Stonework Innovation! We Lead the Way,

244
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,650
Hey, Manager Kim.

245
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,433
Hey, Manager Kim. You okay?

246
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,017
Are you really okay?

247
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,067
- Uh...
- Yeah.

248
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,850
- Hey, Ji An. I'll follow her.
- Okay.

249
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,584
Call the Section Chief immediately
and report the situation!

250
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,267
Yes.

251
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:18,250
Kang Yeon Jung, the serial killer,

252
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,417
was shot dead after
relentless pursuit by the police.

253
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,984
The motive remains under investigation.

254
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:27,217
We, the 140,000 officers of the Korean Police,

255
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,033

will always prioritize public safety.

258
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,184
How's Manager Kim?

259
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:08,550
The surgery went well. No life-threatening issues.

260
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,767
A covert warrant is out for both of you.

261
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,717
You know that, right?

262
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,850
Don't worry.

263
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,284
I'll bring her in.

264
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,950
Where are you? Don't act alone.

265
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,033
Let's find her together, okay?

266
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,417
Section Chief.

267
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,750
Why were you so kind to her?

268
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,667
And to me too.

269
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,767
I get that you two negotiated,

270
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,500
but that alone...

271
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,833
I've always wondered.

272
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,433
Why did you do that?

273
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,567
As a human,

274
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,400
I never thought what Jung I Sin did was wrong.

275
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,684
Why?

276
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,933
You're a police officer.

277
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,300
I was only a police officer

278
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:21,550
when I could proudly say I had achieved

279
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,500
something by catching her.

280
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:26,884
Within legal boundaries,

281
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,250
I wanted to show her some leniency.

282
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,300
Seeing her, my feelings,

283
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,167
two kinds of conflicted feelings.

284
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,033
That's the choice I made between them.

285
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:46,933
Looking at you now,

286
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,133
I think I did the right thing.

287
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:53,667
Snap out of it, mister.

288
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:59,900
Jung I Sin just killed people.

289
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,884
The only difference is her victims were criminals.

290
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:07,600
We failed to stop the crimes and save the people.

291
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:12,117
Whether it's one person or five,

292
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,417
saving people is the police's job.

293
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,600
Sometimes we fail, sometimes we act cowardly,

294
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,767
but in the end, we...

295
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,400
The police...

296
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,850
Su Yeol.

297
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,450
While buying time for tracking me,

298
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,633
you've got too sentimental.

299
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:36,400
Old man.

300
00:29:45,467 --> 00:29:47,184
Cha Su Yeol.

301
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:51,200
You know nothing about Jung I Sin.

302
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:18,650
Peek-a-boo.

303
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,433
I came just in case, and you're actually here.

304
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,050
Chief Bae.

305
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,384
What about Kang Yeon Jung's house?

306
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,917
Think there's something inside?

307
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,050
Would that help find Jung I Sin?

308
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,784
Yes, uh... How's Manager Kim?

309
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:33,433
Luckily, she's in better shape than expected.

310
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,784
But what did you say to Manager Kim?

311
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:39,817
The first thing she said when she woke up was

312
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,167
'Go help Team Leader Cha.'

313
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,033
Let's do it.

314
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,767
I'll open the door for you.

315
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,467
Gosh, it's cold.

316
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,017
Hey, have you even eaten while standing here?

317
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,800
We haven't eaten yet.

318
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,884
The culprit's caught, but
why make you suffer like this?

319
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:04,284
The homeowner died, right?

320
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:05,984
Go, go, go. Let's go.

321
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:08,267
Let's eat and come back. Let's go.

322
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,950
Just try to relax

323
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,467
as naturally as possible.

324
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,750
There's a window.

325
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:06,033
Now, you'll open the window.

326
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,367
Outside the window, there's another world.

327
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:13,717
A realm beyond

328
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,533
consciousness...

329
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:21,650
The world of the subconscious.

330
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:25,284
Open the window with your hands

331
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,067
very very slowly.

332
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:31,933
No.

333
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,450
I don't want to.

334
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,017
It's okay.

335
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,167
I'm here with you.

336
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,033
It's dark.

337
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,567
The sky is dark.

338
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,400
It's night, but a bird is flying.

339
00:34:55,900 --> 00:35:00,367
It's strange. The sun's up, but it's dark.

340
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,617
No...

341
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,600
There's the sun, the moon,

342
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,367
and stars...

343
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,933
Just look at them.

344
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,050
I'll only look at them.

345
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,567
Why is that?

346
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:26,700
I'm just going to do it my way.
I'll only look at that.

Someone is putting something on me.

353
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,750
Cosmetics.

354
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:57,200
Why did they do that?

355
00:35:57,967 --> 00:36:00,533
They say it's because I'm an adult.

356
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,717
No, I'm not.

357
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,050
There's the sun, moon, and stars.

358
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,967

359
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:12,217

360
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,317
Flying, flying...

361
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,717
Fleeing away.

362
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,550

That...

364
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,000
That killed my mom.

365
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:37,150
That burned my mother alive.

366
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:40,600
What is that?

367
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,550
That touches me.

368
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,600
What is that?

369
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,933
