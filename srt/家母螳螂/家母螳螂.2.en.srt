a clerical mistake on their part.

106

107

I only found out later after
meeting the head of the orphanage.

00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,233
Team Leader!

182
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:58,267
This guy is incredibly diligent and thorough.

183
00:14:58,267 --> 00:15:00,433
Welcome to the Queen Mantis World.

184
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:04,000
Sir. I think he was sick or something?

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,333
The pharmacy name's listed here.
I'll go check it out.

186
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,400
While you are at it, you put a bandage on, too.

187
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,133
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:13,467
I'll take this in and check it out.

189
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,300
Alright, go back.

190
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,133
What's this?

191
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:21,233
Why is it wrapped so tightly?

192
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,767
It's a safe.

193
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,400
3D printer.

194
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,167
Team Leader.

195
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,133
Kids, Daddy's home.

196
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,733
I brought chicken.

197
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:28,200
Are you all sleeping?

198
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,208
Not waiting for Dad?

199
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,033
So cruel.

200
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,967
Daddy's heartbroken.

201
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:48,900
Fine, then I'll just eat it all myself.

202
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:11,200
[To Seo Gu Wan, from Jung I Sin]

203
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,067
Jung I Sin.

204
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,033
Anwon Prison.

205
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,333
Jung I Sin sent letters from Anwon Prison?

206
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:22,133
Huh?

207
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:24,640
But, how could Jung I Sin
and Seo Gu Wan exchange letters?

208
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,833
Jung I Sin, whom the world believes to be dead...

209
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,033
What the heck, you punk?

210
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,067
What are you talking about?

211
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't follow.

212
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,933
I'm back.

213
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,567
That woman isn't helping us.

214
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,767
She's using us.

215
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,133
It was Jung I Sin who ordered
Seo Gu Wan to kill people.

216
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,800
What?

217
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,467
Coming here late at night
without even a courtesy call.

218
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,333
Why did you do it?

219
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,633
Why did you tempt Seo Gu Wan,
who was desperate to kill, into doing it?

220
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,367
Was killing five people not enough for you?

221
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,467
Answer me!

222
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,133
You wrote it, huh?

223
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:30,767
Telling him he could
become like you, killing people!

224
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,833
Saying it's no big deal if he tried...

225
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,267
I've never written a reply to someone like that.

226
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,800
Then, what are these?

227
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,800
Do you have proof that I wrote these?

228
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,400
So, you're a police,
and that's all you're good for?

229
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,633
Are you saying you didn't write them?

230
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:00,100
Turn off the lights when you leave.

231
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:14,267
In prison, sleeping, eating,
waking hours are fixed.

232
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:16,200
Lights out means sleep time.

233
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Wake, eat, get sunlight on schedule daily.

234
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,900
You know that, right?

235
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,700
So, anything outside those times,
whatever happens in your world,

236
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,867
you handle yourselves.

237
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,433
That's the rule.

238
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,800
Do I look like I'm on a field trip?

239
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:36,533
This is prison.

240
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,767
Come in the morning if you want to talk.

241
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:41,867
You're the police, aren't you?

242
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,367
Ah, hot.

243
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,700
Honey, aren't you hungry?

244
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,933
The police have announced that they are
releasing the face of Seo Gu Wan,

245
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:32,833
a prime suspect in the recent murder case,
and have upgraded him to a wanted status.

246
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,768
Seo Gu Wan has a history
of schizophrenia and delusional disorder

247
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,104
[Suspect Seo Gu Wan has mental illness]
and has shown signs of mental instability lately,

248
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,100
according to the police.

249
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,167
The police also believe it's highly likely
that Seo Gu Wan is armed,

250
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:48,100
and immediate precautions are being taken.

251
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,067
Police describe Seo Gu Wan is 184 cm tall...

252
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:57,400
This is the handwritten statement
that Jung I Sin wrote 23 years ago.

253
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,367
On the right is the reply that Seo Gu Wan
supposedly received from Jung I Sin.

254
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:02,467
The handwriting...

255
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,833
Not only the handwriting itself,

256
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:07,367
but Jung I Sin's statement
has no spelling errors at all.

257
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,533
The sentences are also very clear and precise.

258
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:13,033
In contrast, Seo Gu Wan's reply letter

259
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:16,667
[Thanks it is]
has many mistakes.

260
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,767
It's definitely not written by the same person.

261
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,533
Then, who wrote the reply?

262
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:28,867
It matches the handwriting found in Seo Gu Wan's
homemade pistol blueprint and notes.

263
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:31,233
It was written by Seo Gu Wan.

264
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,967
[I received your letter well.]

265
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,367
Based on the evidence recovered from his home,

266
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:40,200
Seo Gu Wan seemed to worship
Jung I Sin like a follower.

267
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,167
Perhaps, he wanted to kill someone
but was too scared,

268
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:51,133
so he created delusions
where he received encouragement

269
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:55,433
or instructions from Jung I Sin.

270
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:59,033
Given his long history of schizophrenia
with severe hallucinations and delusions,

271
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,567
this makes sense.

272
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:04,367
We checked the pharmacy
and found a prescription for Seo Gu Wan.

273
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:11,400
The hospital confirmed he had made
an appointment last month but didn't show up.

274
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,333
That timing roughly coincides
with the first murder committed in Noducheon.

275
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,667
Since he stopped taking his medication,
his delusions likely worsened...

276
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:22,367
He's a dangerous lunatic,
which makes his behavior unpredictable.

277
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,000
Any tips?

278
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,233
All of them are just prank calls.

279
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,733
By the way, Seo Gu Wan's computer
has been unlocked.

280
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:00,133
Who's that man?

281
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:02,233
Where's Dad?

282
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,767
Listen to Mommy.

283
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,433
Do whatever he tells you to do.

284
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,900
No questions.

285
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,400
Who are these people?

286
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,100
This man's definitely insane.

287
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,367
What?

288
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,000
Look.

289
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Hey, you monster...

290
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,967
Car number here.

291
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,067
We got the license plate.

292
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,700
Trace the owner's address from this plate.

293
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,633
Request backup teams ready to move
as soon as we get the address.

294
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:00,800
Gear up.

295
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,100
Ah, the homemade pistol.

296
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,700
- Got the address.
- Let's go.

297
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,633
Yes, this is Detective Bae Seong Gyu
from Violent Crimes Investigation Team 1.

298
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,000
We repeat our announcement.

299
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,733
The police have announced that they are
releasing the face of Seo Gu Wan,

300
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:34,733
a prime suspect in the recent murder case,
and have upgraded him to a wanted status.

301
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,633
Seo Gu Wan has a history of...

302
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,800
It's done.

303
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,033
Mom.

304
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:48,700
It's okay, don't be scared.

305
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,200
I did what you said.

306
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,033
Where's their father?

307
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,300
Water's running.

308
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,700
Why is the bathroom faucet on?

309
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,433
Tear that up.

310
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,200
I said tear that up.

311
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,733
Mom.

312
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,400
It's okay.

313
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,367
If you listen to the man, we'll all be fine.

314
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,867
Right?

315
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,333
Sorry, Dad.

316
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,333
He's your dad.

317
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:34,233
If you listen to your dad, we'll all be okay.

318
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,267
Tear that up.

319
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,933
Listen to Dad.

320
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:47,100
Hurry up.

321
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,433
Where's Dad?

322
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:50,033
Where's my dad?

323
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:52,367
You're not my dad!

324
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:53,400
No, stop it.

325
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,933
Wait, I'll tear it up.

326
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:57,333
He's too young. Let me do it.

327
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,600
Seung Min, you...

328
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,167
Please, let me tear it!

329
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,833
Be quiet.

330
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,667
What's wrong?

331
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:14,167
Who else is here?

332
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:15,433
It's just us.

333
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:17,167
So Eun!

334
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,167
Honey. Why are you lying?

335
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:25,400
I... I hear voices here.

336
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:27,433
Don't you hear them?

337
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:32,100
There's no sound. What voices?

338
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,833
No, no...

339
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,667
Are you saying I'm going crazy?

340
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,567
Why can't you hear this?

341
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,600
You monster!

342
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,967
How dare you talk to Dad like that?

343
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,200
You are a bad guy!

344
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,300
Seung Min, you...

345
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,933
You need to be punished.

346
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,000
- Seung Min!
- Mom!

347
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,167
- Seung Min!
- Mom! Mom!

348
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,167
Seung Min, no! Please!

349
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:56,833
Mom!

350
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,167
- Apartments are shared living spaces.
- Seung Min!

351
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,233
- Please be mindful of noise between floors.
- Mom!

352
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,000
Mom, help me!

353
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,733
- Mom, help me.
- Please wear soft shoes or walk lightly.

354
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:09,133
Seung Min! Please, I'm begging you.

355
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,967
- I'll do everything you say.
- Mom.

356
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,700
Please, save my Seung Min.

357
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Dad, Dad!

358
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,767
Don't move. Police.

359
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Police.

360
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,733
Put your hands down. Slowly.

361
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:23,967
See? I told you someone was here!

362
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,367
Shut up and put your hands down! Slowly.

363
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,367
He peed himself.

364
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,467
I was just trying to clean him up.

365
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,167
Put the child down.

366
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,200
Mr. Seo Gu Wan, you are placed
under emergency arrest

367
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
on suspicion of the murder of
Kim Hyeon Woo and Kang Soo Cheol,

368
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
- and the disposal of their bodies.
- You are Seung Min, right?

369
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,632
I'll untie you now. Just wait a little.

370
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:46,667
You have the right to hire a lawyer,

371
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,533
- Let's go to Mom.
- remain silent, and be aware that

372
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,700
anything you say can be used as evidence in court.

373
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,333
And when we get to the police station,
you're going to get scolded badly by me.

374
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,767
Yes, everything's secure. Don't worry.

375
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,567
Hyuk, check the master bedroom.

376
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,567
Understood.

377
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:06,767
- Mom, Mom!
- Hyun Seo, come here. Seung Min.

378
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,900
Team Leader.

379
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,733
Mr. Kim Tae Seok is not home.

380
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,167
Good work.

381
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,200
- Got anything?
- Yes.

382
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,733
- Salute.
- Salute. Keep up the good work.

383
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,100
Thanks for the meal.

384
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,133
- Yeah, eat up.
- Enjoy.

385
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:41,900
The missing husband Kim Tae Seok
and Seo Gu Wan are half-brothers.

386
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,833
Half-brothers? So, they have different fathers?

387
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,833
Correct.

388
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,100
Seo Gu Wan's biological mother

389
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,567
had already relinquished parental rights
before giving birth to him.

390
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:53,333
So, Seo Gu Wan was transferred
from the hospital to an orphanage,

391
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,600
and his birth mother Kim Young Seon
got married just a few months later.

392
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,133
After marrying, she gave birth
to Kim Tae Seok the following year.

393
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:05,467
The biological mother Kim Young Seon
died from chronic illness a year ago.

394
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:09,700
Wait, the mother abandoned him,
so why target the half-brother?

395
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:14,200
'Reverse Life'.

396
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,433
What's that?

397
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,700
When we checked Seo Gu Wan's internet history,

398
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,200
he'd repeatedly read this web novel
called 'Reverse Life' dozens of times.

399
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,767
It's part of the 'reincarnation
possession rebirth' genre.

400
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,200
Reincarnation... what?

401
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,900
Regression possession rebirth.

402
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,267
It's the so-called reincarnation genre,
a life that changes overnight.

403
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:32,300
For example,

404
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,200
someone from a poor background wakes up
one morning as the heir to a conglomerate.

405
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,767
But Noducheon, the moving warehouse case,
and Seo Gu Wan aren't really connected...

406
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,433
For now, focus only on Kim Tae Seok.

407
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:45,267
Use any means necessary to make him talk.

408
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,367
Kim Tae Seok's photo shouldn't be posted there.

409
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,700
- Got it?
- Yes, understood.

410
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,067
Mr. Kim Tae Seok.

411
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,433
Where is the husband of that family now?

412
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,967
Is he alive?

413
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:06,067
Mr. Seo, this behavior could work against you.

414
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:13,667
Mr. Seo. Look at me
when I'm talking to you, got it?

415
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,967
Mr. Seo.

416
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,600
You were abandoned, right? By your mother?

417
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:29,300
A mother. A wife. Cute kids. A happy family.

418
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,133
All of that could've been yours, right?

419
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,933
It was mine. Not 'could've been'.

420
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:35,933
It was just mine.

421
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:39,167
So, you wanted to take it all back?
Like in 'Reverse Life'?

422
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:42,933
I took it? It was always mine.

423
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,833
Abandoned? That's your son.

424
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,700
That's what they call 'giving up parental rights.'

425
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,567
Yeah, if I was left at the orphanage,

426
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:57,000
then you abandoned the kid
with your useless husband.

427
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,467
- How did you...
- You abandoned him, right?

428
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:01,667
Because he's an autistic burden.

429
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,000
You heartless rat!

430
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,667
- Was he ashamed?
- Get in there.

431
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,200
- Yes.
- You probably wanted to abandon him.

432
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,900
It would've been better if he died.

433
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,600
Shut your darn mouth, you maniac!

434
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,833
- Manager!
- Let go of me!

435
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,867
Don't you see that's a predictable trick?

436
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,967
Manager Kim!

437
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:40,433
Hey.

438
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,900
Mr. Seo Gu Wan. What are you doing?

439
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:56,267
Just sit down. Sit.

440
00:31:57,867 --> 00:32:00,800
But, here...

441
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
Are we really alone here?

442
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,267
Yes.

443
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,633
You're lying.

444
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:13,967
Turn all these off and everyone get out.

445
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,767
You see that?

446
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:31,900
I've never seen Manager Kim get that worked up.

447
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:37,667
I knew you'd investigated our backgrounds,
but I didn't expect you to know about... that.

448
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:42,600
Ah, well, the district office
has all sorts of documents.

449
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,800
I filled in the gaps by doing some legwork.

450
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,267
Why Kim Tae Seok?

451
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:59,300
If that punk had never been born,
my mother would've come back for me for sure.

452
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,333
She must have.

453
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:08,664
So, did you even go so far
as to kill Mr. Kim Tae Seok?

454
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,233
Q... Queen Mantis...

455
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,533
How was your mother? What kind of person was she?

456
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,933
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

457
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,667
I know that she doesn't want others to know.

458
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:42,967
If I tell you, will you tell me
where Kim Tae Seok is?

459
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:54,500
Come on. We're having an important discussion.

460
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,433
Let's keep it down!

461
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,033
Don't mind them.

462
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:04,600
Mr. Seo Gu Wan, you know
how Jung I Sin lives in prison, right?

463
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,167
Espresso? I heard from the guards.

464
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:11,533
That's because we negotiated with her.

465
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,000
You should do the same, Mr. Seo.

466
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,900
Give one to get one.

467
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,967
Even I only make these offers
to Queen Mantis-level figures.

468
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:27,767
So, what do you think about your mother?

469
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,767
She's a criminal.

470
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,633
So, um...

471
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:52,633
15 kg, that would be about this much?

472
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:55,400
What do you mean?

473
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,033
The child's weight.

474
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,667
They said it was a 10-year-old.

475
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,400
The ankles were worn to the bone,
and they were chained.

476
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:18,900
One nostril was crushed,
and because it was disgusting to breathe,

477
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,133
he burned it with a heated spoon.

478
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:24,900
What are you talking about?

479
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,700
That beast's father.

480
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,767
The Queen Mantis herself killed that monster.

481
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,167
And you still call her just a criminal? Jeez...

482
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:43,967
Well, let's just be frank.

483
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:46,167
You've killed someone before, right?

484
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,967
Or almost killed?

485
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:59,100
Why so hesitant? That's why you became a cop.

486
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,800
That look... Now you look like her son.

487
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:25,533
Your insight... I never thought of it that way.

488
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,533
You... you've got sharp instincts.

489
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,467
Seems like we understand each other.

490
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,467
Just drop a single clue, will you?

491
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:42,333
Where's Kim Tae Seok... No.

492
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:45,000
First, let's confirm if he's even alive.

493
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,933
What now?

494
00:36:50,933 --> 00:36:52,667
Are we understanding each other?

495
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Not at all.

496
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:44,067
No choice then. Let's get her.

497
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,933
He's a Queen Mantis fanatic.

498
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,767
He'll talk in front of her.

499
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,616
What?

500
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:59,800
Do we have to keep relying on Jung I Sin?

501
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,567
Even though it's info I got from her,
I have to pretend

502
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:04,033
I found it myself in front of the team.

503
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:08,033
And seeing her toss us little hints
and smirk like that,

504
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:10,200
I can't do that either.

505
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,233
Su Yeol.

506
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,400
About that time...

507
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,600
The incident 23 years ago.

508
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,767
There's something I never told you.

509
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:52,300
Here. You worked hard today.

510
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,867
You really don't have to
give her something like this.

511
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:56,400
It's okay.

512
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,300
What are you doing? You should say 'Thank you.'

513
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,667
Thank you.

514
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,800
Yes.

515
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,533
- Let's go.
- Goodbye.

516
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,267
Bye.

517
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,400
You love kids so much, but don't have any plans?

518
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,733
Raising you is already overwhelming.

519
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:15,767
A latte?

520
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,067
No, black coffee for me.

521
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:21,633
So, no plans for children?

522
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:23,467
Should I ask Su Yeol?

523
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,833
Ugh, don't.

524
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,067
He hates that kind of talk.

525
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,467
It's because of Cha Su Yeol, huh?

526
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,600
But usually when people lose their parents,

527
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,333
don't they want kids even more
to fight loneliness?

528
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,767
Yes, that's me.

529
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,433
Sorry.

530
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,333
That's not what I meant, Jung Yeon.

531
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,800
It's fine. Because I think so too.

532
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:51,733
On my parents' death anniversaries,
I think about it more.

533
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,433
I want a child.

534
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,700
But Su Yeol... His memories with his parents...

535
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,133
Weren't good?

536
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:04,733
He doesn't say it,
but sometimes calls 'Mom' in his sleep.

537
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,567
A tough detective crying for his mom while asleep?

538
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,833
Su Yeol's adorable. So cute.

539
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,533
If they were alive, I'd try
to mediate their reconciliation.

540
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,900
Huh? What does that mean?

541
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,433
It's totally a blessing that
your in-laws aren't around.

542
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:22,200
What nonsense...

543
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,467
Hey.

544
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,667
Oh right, you wanted black coffee, huh?

545
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,367
Hello, hello.

546
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:57,833
I'm not sure if it's the right call to bring
the suspect in the ongoing investigation here.

547
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,367
This is a precautionary measure.

548
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,667
We meet like this.

549
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:14,767
Wait, where is this place?

550
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,300
This doesn't look like prison.

551
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,333
You copied my methods exactly?

552
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:24,667
As closely as possible.

553
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:29,200
Why did you do that?

554
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:36,167
The world needs to know what the Queen Mantis did.

555
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:40,867
Everyone needs to know how you
handled those worthless scumbags.

556
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:44,167
They need to know everything.

557
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,833
I mean it.

558
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,833
Yeah?

559
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,800
How did it feel?

560
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,000
Uh... amazing.

561
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,667
Totally thrilling.

562
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,467
Just like you said, it was no big deal.

563
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Why use an axe?

564
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,800
It ends too quickly that way.

565
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,600
That's because...

566
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:22,833
That's...

567
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:28,767
Blood must've splattered on your face.

568
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:31,067
Did it spray on your face?

569
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,233
How did it feel?

570
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,230
Um, well...

571
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,367
After the head rolled, how many
seconds did they keep breathing?

572
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,433
Twenty seconds?

573
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,433
Thirty seconds?

574
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,133
Tell me.

575
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:55,633
You enjoyed it because of me.
You should talk then.

576
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,833
You're lying, huh?

577
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:17,900
You didn't kill anyone, right?

578
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,567
No, it's not.

579
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,336
You just held a gun, right? Because
you were too scared to actually use it.

580
00:43:22,336 --> 00:43:23,400
No...

581
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
You didn't even have bullets, right?

582
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,533
See? You think a coward like you can mimic me?

583
00:43:31,267 --> 00:43:32,267
Get lost.

584
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:34,467
No, I killed him.

585
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,667
That punk Kim Tae Seok...

586
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:41,133
Dead. He must be dead.

587
00:43:42,933 --> 00:43:45,167
Must be dead?

588
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,533
So did you just dump him in some river?

589
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:56,200
Maybe? You were too scared to finish it yourself?

590
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
No, that's not true.

591
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,767
No?

592
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:03,367
Then, where and how did you do it?

593
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:07,233
Tell me. How did you do it?

594
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,200
I fixed everything. Right from the start...

595
00:44:14,667 --> 00:44:17,900
You can't tell, right?
Because you didn't kill him.

596
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,700
No guts, scared.

597
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:30,584
That's right, you are so cowardly,

598
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:35,133
and that's why your mother abandoned you.

599
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:40,167
She realized early on
her child would be this pathetic.

600
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:43,767
You. You tramp.

601
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,033
These pigs.

602
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,033
They're all...

603
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:55,733
Why?

604
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:00,767
All because of that cop, your son, huh?

605
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,167
Then, what about me?

606
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:07,133
I followed you all the way here!

607
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,333
Just because I'm not blood?

608
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:15,067
That's why you're treating me like this?

609
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,200
Ah, I get it. I'll expose everything.

610
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,300
The serial killer Jung I Sin is alive!

611
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,967
And her son is an active-duty cop Cha Su Yeol!

612
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:31,867
Lee Jung Yeon.

613
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,967
I'll reveal even that pig's wife's name
to the whole world.

614
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,233
Jung I Sin!

615
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,167
Let go of him!

616
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,400
Let him go!

617
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,633
Ms. Jung I Sin!

618
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,867
Let go!

619
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:12,533
I said let go!

620
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,192
- Hey, snap out of it.
- Seo Gu Wan.

621
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:17,216
Seo Gu Wan!

622
00:46:17,216 --> 00:46:18,240
- Snap out of it!
- Seo Gu Wan!

623
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,967
Are you crazy?

624
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,667
- Director Park.
- Seo Gu Wan!

625
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,933
We need to end this.

626
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:26,800
We have to kill him now.

627
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,767
You heard everything, no? He knows it all.

628
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,000
Get a grip, Seo Gu Wan.

629
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,833
Seo Gu Wan, are you okay?

630
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,933
Seo Gu Wan!

631
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,267
Hey, you punk! Hey!

632
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:38,967
- Seo Gu Wan.
- Seo Gu Wan!

633
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,133
All exits are sealed.

634
00:46:48,333 --> 00:46:49,967
Seo Gu Wan!

635
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,967
Don't come any closer, you pigs!

636
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,300
Calm down. Calm down and lower your gun.

637
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
Shut up.

638
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,733
Seo Gu Wan, this will only make it harder for you.

639
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:20,300
Who's there? Come out. Come out!

640
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Come out, you devil!

641
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,233
Wait a minute, wait.

642
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:28,667
It's too noisy. All of you.

643
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,433
Hey, Seo Gu Wan.

644
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,033
Right, It's too noisy.

645
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:40,467
It's not just you hearing it.

646
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:43,367
I hear it too. Seo Gu Wan.

647
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:55,800
I know it, too.

648
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,500
You're lying.

649
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:25,760
Commissioner,

650
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,200
[Southern Provincial Police Station]
thank you for saving me and the kids yesterday.

651
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,367
I'm truly grateful.

652
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,100
But my husband... I still don't know where he is.

653
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,800
Could something have gone wrong...

654
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,600
I still haven't heard anything about my husband.

655
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,067
Please, find my husband.

656
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm begging you, Commissioner. Please save him.

657
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,133
Please...

658
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,867
Yes.

659
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,300
Yes, understood.

660
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,233
Alright.

661
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:04,133
At the headquarters' main gate,
Kim Tae Seok's wife is causing a scene.

662
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:06,333
They told us to stay away since it's chaotic.

663
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,832
What, are we the criminals?

664
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:09,833
Where are you going?

665
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,933
Shouldn't we make Seo Gu Wan talk?

666
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:13,233
Seo Gu Wan isn't here.

667
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,233
- What?
- What?

668
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:19,133
Chief and Team Leader took him
somewhere earlier. Didn't you hear?

669
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:22,838
Darn it.

670
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:30,600
Sir, sir. You need to pull yourself together, sir.

671
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,100
What's this person's name?

672
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,767
Seo Gu Wan, Seo Gu Wan.

673
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:35,933
Mr. Seo Gu Wan.

674
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:39,033
Mr. Seo Gu Wan, pull yourself together.
Mr. Seo Gu Wan.

675
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,133
- The director...
- Where are you?

676
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,467
Yeah, I'm following you.

677
00:49:41,467 --> 00:49:42,500
What about Seo Gu Wan?

678
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,967
His condition is critical, but he's conscious.

679
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:46,200
You saw when he talked
to Jung I Sin earlier, right?

680
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,133
Seo Gu Wan has nothing to do
with the copycat murders.

681
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:50,433
The real problem is her husband Kim Tae Seok.

682
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:51,967
We need to make Seo Gu Wan talk quickly.

683
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:55,067
As long as Kim Tae Seok
comes back alive, no one will be hurt

684
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:56,800
and Seo Gu Wan will fade
from the media's attention.

685
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,200
If he won't talk?

686
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,467
Then, we make him talk.

687
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:01,133
What if he keeps dodging questions?

688
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:03,000
It's not about Kim Tae Seok...

689
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,033
Mr. Seo Gu Wan.

690
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:07,133
What if he only talks about me and that woman?

691
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,367
Don't worry. I've already informed the director.

692
00:50:09,367 --> 00:50:12,033
Jung I Sin also stayed at that hospital
during her incarceration.

693
00:50:12,033 --> 00:50:13,067
Seo Gu Wan

694
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:14,367
will be completely cut off from the outside.

695
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,267
For now, focus on Kim Tae Seok...

696
00:50:16,267 --> 00:50:17,633
I'm getting a call from Manager Kim.

697
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,367
Just give a vague answer, okay?

698
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,067
Huh?

699
00:50:27,433 --> 00:50:29,200
Yes, understood.

700
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,800
What did he say?

701
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,712
He apparently tried to harm himself
in the detention center?

702
00:50:35,712 --> 00:50:38,000
They're transferring him to the hospital.

703
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,776
What?

704
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:41,440
Was he badly hurt?

705
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,167
Darn, that guy's insane.

706
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:47,133
Mr. Seo Gu Wan. We're almost there.

707
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:50,067
We need to end this.

708
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,533
You heard everything, no? He knows it all.

709
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:58,967
Lee Jung Yeon.

710
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,867
I'll reveal even that pig's wife's name
to the whole world.

711
00:51:04,867 --> 00:51:07,233
We have to kill him now.

712
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,133
Mr. Seo Gu Wan! Mr. Seo Gu Wan!

713
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,700
What's happening?

714
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,867
- What's wrong?
- Cardiac arrest.

715
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:17,933
- Assist breathing. One, two, three, four, five...
- Mr. Seo Gu Wan...

716
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:19,400
Seo Gu Wan!

717
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,800
No! Seo Gu Wan!

718
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,133
How is he?

719
00:51:56,333 --> 00:52:00,933
Luckily, the bullet only grazed him,
but his skull is fractured and there's bleeding.

720
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:04,433
Treatment is done and he's alive,
but total rest is required.

721
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:08,267
A security guard is stationed
in his isolation room,

722
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:11,300
and security is tight, so don't worry.

723
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:21,933
Remember when Jung I Sin asked
what he did to Kim Tae Seok,

724
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:26,167
Seo Gu Wan said 'he must be dead'
rather than 'he is dead,'

725
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:28,967
as if he wasn't really sure himself?

726
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:31,200
No, I killed him.

727
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,200
That punk Kim Tae Seok.

728
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,133
Dead. He must be dead.

729
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:47,600
Did you just dump him in some river?

730
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,933
Section Chief.

731
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,533
Seo Gu Wan couldn't counter
Jung I Sin's statement.

732
00:52:53,533 --> 00:52:58,200
If he really killed him,
he would've given a different answer.

733
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:03,000
But what if Seo Gu Wan just left

734
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,100
Kim Tae Seok in a situation where he could die,

735
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,267
without directly killing him?

736
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:17,100
That means Kim Tae Seok
could still be alive somewhere.

737
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,800
So we still have time.

738
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:26,100
But the only one who knows the location
is lying in there like that.

739
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:34,467
I fixed everything. Right from the start...

740
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:39,500
What? Why?

741
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,333
Uh, well...

742
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,267
Hey, Su Yeol. What?

743
00:53:44,267 --> 00:53:45,900
Yes, Ji An.

744
00:53:48,033 --> 00:53:49,333
What's all this?

745
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,367
[Yeonam General Hospital]

746
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:54,900
Almost every year since 2007,
he took photos at the same hospital?

747
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,600
Seo Gu Wan believes Kim Tae Seok stole his life.

748
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,467
He's convinced their lives were swapped.

749
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:06,133
And before Seo Gu Wan self-harmed,
he told me and the Section Chief

750
00:54:06,133 --> 00:54:09,233
that he didn't kill him, but that he must be dead.

751
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:12,233
He claimed he had fixed everything from the start.

752
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:17,100
If he didn't kill him directly,
but left him somewhere to die,

753
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,300
then the place would be
where he believed his misfortune began,

754
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,967
which would be this hospital
where he was abandoned, right?

755
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:27,267
Wait, look at these photos.

756
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,633
Taking pictures of one place obsessively for years

757
00:54:30,633 --> 00:54:33,900
means this place is important to that punk.

758
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,400
What does everyone think about
Team Leader Cha's opinion?

759
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,333
If two days pass after a disappearance,
the survival rate drops to just 30%.

760
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,800
We're running out of time.

761
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,867
Please trust me and follow my lead.

762
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:47,533
I've never talked nonsense before, right?

763
00:54:47,533 --> 00:54:48,800
What, investigation is a religion?

764
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,600
What's there to blindly believe in?

765
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,333
Was the narcotics team's investigation
based on mere hunches?

766
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,133
Enough.

767
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,033
Let's move out now.

768
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:00,867
If there's even a small lead, we should check it.

769
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:03,600
Besides, Team Leader's theory isn't unreasonable.

770
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,933
Right. Let's search everywhere. Move out.

771
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:08,533
Report in real-time upon arrival.

772
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:09,700
Did everyone hear that?

773
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,800
Heungshin Sageori Yeonam General Hospital. Move.

774
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,533
Let's go.

775
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:24,367
The killer probably mimicked Jung I Sin.

776
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,000
Since the third murder was a drowning,

777
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,733
let's assume drowning
and look for locations with water.

778
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,400
Let's go.

779
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:06,067
I'm from Southern Provincial Police Station.

780
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:13,933
I've checked the underground reservoir.

781
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,267
Checked laundry room.

782
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,633
How is it going?

783
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,700
Ah, nothing. Nothing here.

784
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,733
What now?

785
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:41,233
Should we check for dishwater?

786
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:42,933
Hey, let's go.

787
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:54,833
Ugh, this feels like a wild goose chase.

788
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:03,167
Hey, why don't we just pressure
Seo Gu Wan to make him talk?

789
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,300
He's in a coma from self-harm anyway.

790
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,067
Continuing the search here
seems like a waste of time...

791
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,733
Ji An, found anything?

792
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:13,400
Nothing so far.

793
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,800
I've scrubbed through days of footage,

794
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,400
but no sign of Seo Gu Wan.

795
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,128
He's definitely here somewhere...

796
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:23,032
I killed him. That punk Kim Tae Seok.

797
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:27,960
Dead. He must be dead.

798
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,667
He couldn't finish it himself.

799
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:35,267
He must've left him
in a lethal situation somewhere.

800
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,864
[Floor Information]

801
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,600
Good work. Well...

802
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,933
Is this going to the ward's laundry room?

803
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:53,267
Nah, that's too small.

804
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,033
We do the laundry at the laundry factory.

805
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:56,767
But there's no such thing on the directory.

806
00:57:56,767 --> 00:58:00,167
Who would mark that place on it?

807
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:02,300
Where is it?

808
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,784
- Downloading now.
- Good job.

809
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:09,533
What now? Let's at least return to base.

810
00:58:09,533 --> 00:58:12,333
How can we go back without Team Leader?

811
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,167
Annex, laundry factory!

812
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,433
What?

813
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,467
Seong Gyu, over here.

814
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:35,567

815
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:40,333
My god!

816
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:45,304
Jeez!

819
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,167
Seong Gyu, call an ambulance.

820
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,933
Don't die.

821
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:08,167
Mr. Kim Tae Seok!

Please, please.

826
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,867
No!

827
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:35,433
They've set up the mirror like some kind of 4DX.

'Don't bother the wrong person

That's number 0 here.

01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:50,367
It's only a number,
but there's no material at all.

835
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:52,300
You can't just slap a number on it
without any reason.

836
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,900
The first murder we don't know about.

837
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,467
How would Seo Gu Wan know about that?

838
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,933
There are more than just five people, right?
