Bad guy, go away!

I'm in my room?

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
Bad guy,

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,800
you're so annoying even in my dream!

Dan Zhu!

Miss,

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,600
who tied you up like that?

10
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:37,760
Hurry.

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
Untie me.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,320
I'm giving you fifteen minutes.

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,640
Come here right now.

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,080
Listen up.

my daughter is coming home.

17
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,040
I give you two hours

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,720
to change all the furniture at home.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Also,

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,280
that...

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Light up

22
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,760
the incense burner.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
Take the curtain down.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,520
Take it down.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:35,920
Take it down.

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,880
Change it to

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
East Sea Pearl.

28

Also,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
my daughter

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,880
likes to eat ham

31
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,560
and pineapple cookie.

32
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
Prepare

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,960
as much as we could.

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
Stop staring at me.

35
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Get back to work.

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
Why am I so tired?

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,240
Miss,

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,360
Sir Xu has prepared the

39
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
horse-drawn vehicle for you to go home.

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,880
Are you going back?

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
What time is it now?

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
It's just passed noon.

43
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Where's he?

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,000
He's left home since morning.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,280
Dear.

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,760
Be gentle.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,120
Be gentle.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,800
There are many people here.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Please keep my dignity,

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
okay?

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,560
I disagreed with

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
marrying Huan to the Grand Secretariat.

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
Yet you insisted on

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,440
His Majesty to bestow the marriage.

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,760
Did they even show you any favour?

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
Ever since Huan got married,

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,760
as her mother,

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,520
I could

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,200
hardly see her anymore.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't care.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Huan is coming back.

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
We need her to stay for at least
10 days to half a month.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,040
Okay.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,080
I'll listen to you.

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,800
I'll listen to you.

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,400
Dear, your hand

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,600
has

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
become so strong.

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:56,960
Master!

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,960
This is bad!

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Miss has been kidnapped!

72
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,000
(Two hours later, Yueya Mountain,)

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,900
(small bamboo forest house,
3,000 taels of gold.)

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,780
(We'll kill the jade owner
if you don't follow this.)

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,520
Dear.

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,520
Are you okay?

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,040
Dear.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,920
What's going on?

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,840
3,000 taels of gold?

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,840
My precious daughter

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
is priceless.

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
She's priceless.

83
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Dear.

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,960
Are you okay?

85
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,280
Father.

86
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,120
All our money is here.

87
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
But if we convert it into gold,

88
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,800
it's not even 1,000 taels.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,400
What?

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
I've fought in the battle
for my whole life.

91
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,240
That's all the wealth I have?

92
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
Why you are looking at me?

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Dear,

94
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,120
if we can save Huan,

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
you're willing

96
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,760
to do anything,

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,400
right?

98
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Dear,

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
why did

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
you say that?

101
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Dear.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,840
Do you

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
have a better idea?

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,960
Why not

105
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,000
you go and swap

106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,920
with Huan?

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,400
Do I

108
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,200
worth

109
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,440
3,000 taels of gold?

110
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,660
(Two hours later)

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,260
You...

112
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,400
Are you the leader of the kidnappers?

113
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,600
Where's my sister?

114
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,240
Where are the 3,000 taels of gold?

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,400
We

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
couldn't gather so much gold for now.

117
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Don't worry.

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
My father is a general.

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
He's worth 3,000 taels of gold.

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Take him with you.

121
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Shut up.

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,920
Do you think I'm a butcher
and you're actually negotiating?
