00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,360
Since I came here through this place,

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
I should be able to go back here.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,760
Let me eat first.

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Let me eat first.

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,680
Let me eat first.

8
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,640
No way.

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
I can't swim.

10
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,440
Also,

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm so young

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
and so beautiful.

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,880
I haven't seen

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,520
handsome men enough.

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Miss!

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
Don't do that!

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,880
I was right for not jumping in.

18
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,480
I heard that

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
General Shen's family

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,000
loves Shen Zhihuan.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,560
Is that true?

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,000
Miss,

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,320
your question

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
is weird.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,960
Just answer me.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,840
Of course it's true.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,880
Master and Madam Shen

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,760
treat you

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,360
as their precious.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,400
Your brother

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,160
can't bear to see

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
you being bullied.

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,280
(It's the same as recorded in the book.)

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,440
Is Shen family

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,240
wealthy?

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm not sure how much money

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,640
Shen family has.

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,200
However,

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
Master Shen is the general

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,480
that's important to His Majesty.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
I think

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,880
he's rich.

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,160
The imperial examination is coming.

44

Yanqing,

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,480
I remember you scored the highest

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
three years ago.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
In just a few years,

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
you've become

49
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
my important Grand Secretariat.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,560
I want you

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,640
to be in charge of
the imperial examination.

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,440
The imperial court will be convinced.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

54
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,080
Also,

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,120
I've read

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
the Censors' memorial.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
There will be people cheating

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
in the imperial examination every year.

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Therefore,

60
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,320
investigate in

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
this imperial examination.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
If there's any cheater,

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:24,920
whether

64
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,680
they're of the authority
or the royal family,

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,520
you need to

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
punish them

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
and not let anyone go.

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,880
Yes.

71

Miss,

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,640
I've been serving you for so long.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,960
I didn't know that you can cook well.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,760
Eat and stop talking.

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,800
Miss,

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
you've been looking at it.

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
What are you trying to write?

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
A divorce settlement agreement.

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
A divorce settlement agreement?

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Sister, since you've decided to divorce,

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,480
you should talk to Sir Xu

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,600
as soon as possible.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,040
After all, everyone knows that

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,840
you were making

85
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,200
a scene

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
and General Shen

87
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
was crying in front of His Majesty,

88
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
His Majesty had no choice
but to marry you to Sir Xu

89
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,760
and Sir Xu

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,760
had to obey and marry you.

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,960
You...

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,440
You're just a female hostess.

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
Why are you so arrogant?

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,520
You're cheap and lowly.

95
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
Sir Xu will not like you.

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,680
You...

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
You can't do anything you like here.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,600
Also,

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm General Shen's daughter.

100
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,440
I only have a brother

101

and no sister.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,680
If you keep calling me

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,800
"sister",

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,960
it's not only hurting my ears,

105
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
you'll also sound like you want
to get something from us.

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,920
Why is it so happening here?

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,360
What are you doing?

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,040
We didn't do anything.

109
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,440
Madam Xu,

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,880
I'm cheap and lowly.

111
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,960
I shouldn't have called you "sister".

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm only here to thank you

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
for saving me.

114
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,520
Please

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
don't be mad at me.

You need to return the favour.

Kneel here!

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
You lowly servant!

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
You're just a hostess

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,680
and how dare you seduce my husband!
