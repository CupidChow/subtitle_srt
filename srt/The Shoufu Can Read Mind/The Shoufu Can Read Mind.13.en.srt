Dear,

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,360
we're a family, right?

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Family should help each other, right?

6
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,600
Aren't we soulmates?

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,640
How come we're a family now?

8
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,320
If you're not screaming,

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,920
I don't mind

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:18,760
getting you...

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,400
Stop it!

(Bad guy.)

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,040
Thank you.

14
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Why did you fight?

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,680
She said you dislike me

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,320
and you have a mistress out there.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
She even beat Dan Zhu.

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,760
That's why I was angry

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
and I beat her up.

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,360
Look!

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,080
Dan Zhu's face was injured by her.

22
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,480
What? What I said is the truth.

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,960
Just because you're close
to Grand Secretariat

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,200
and General Shen,

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,520
you're bullying others.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,200
How dare you!

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,960
How dare you gossip about
the officers of the imperial court?

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
Are you seeking death upon yourself?

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,240
You...

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,440
You believe what she said?

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
I trust my wife,

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
not an outsider.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
Just wait and see!

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,760
My good daughter.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,520
You

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,160
have gone too easy on her.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Father.

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,600
You're indeed my sister.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,760
You've never lost in a fight

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
just like me.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160

42
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
thanks to you

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,360
that not only we're not in any trouble,

44

His Majesty even

45

allows Le

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,240
to study in the Imperial Academy.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
This is all your contribution.

Father,

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,080
don't forget that

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,120
he has cheated

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
your 1,000 taels of gold.

52
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,720
Let's not

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
talk about that.

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,560
Let's go.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go home.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,840
Let's go.

(Zheng Dumpling Restaurant)

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
The imperial examination case
has come to an end.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
Tonight,

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,040
you'll be moving back to your room,
right?

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
What are you doing?

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Does it hurt?

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
If you don't want any scars,

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,680
don't move.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,960
I thought you're good at fighting.

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
Yet you've injured yourself.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
Look at how bad she's injured.

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
Am I not good at fighting?

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,120
You're Xu Yanqing's wife.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,880
If you face anything

71
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,320
and you can't protect yourself,

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
take a step back

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,840
and come back to look for me.

ever since I've come to this place,

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
I haven't eaten any delicacies.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,160
I want to eat a bowl
of hot beef noodles.
