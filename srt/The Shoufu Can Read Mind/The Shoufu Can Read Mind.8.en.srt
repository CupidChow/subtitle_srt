We

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,200
couldn't gather so much gold for now.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,800
Don't worry.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,800
My father is a general.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,360
He's worth 3,000 taels of gold.

8
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,080
Take him with you.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,840
Shut up.

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,440
Do you think I'm a butcher

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,840
and you're actually negotiating?

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't kill me.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,240
We've given you the money.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,240
Kill him first.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,960
Shut up.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,200
What did you make me
press my thumbprint on?

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the evidence that
you colluded with Sir Zhou

18
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,000
to cheat

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,520
on the imperial examination.

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,120
I'll just need to report this
to the magistrate

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,880
and Shen family is done.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,160
Who are you?

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Where is my sister?

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
Where are you hiding my sister?

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,280
Don't worry.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,960
We're robbers with dignity.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
We won't harm a little girl.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's go.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,400
Father.

30
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
Will our whole clan
be sentenced to death?

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Talk to me.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,760
What should I say?

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
What else should I say?

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,800
You're useless.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
I should ask you instead.
Are you even my father?

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,000
If it wasn't for you, a useless son,

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,600
why would I look for Sir Zhou?

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,440
I'll beat you.

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Father.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,160
Yanqing?

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,960
Madam.

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,400
Miss Shen is back safely.

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Mother!

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,280
Huan!

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,640
- It's good that you're fine.
- Mother!

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,560
I was so worried.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Mother,

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
what could've happened to me?

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
Weren't you kidnapped?

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,040
Your father and Le
went to redeem you.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,400
They have yet to come home.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,920
What?

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,720
So,

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,440
the kidnappers

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
got the evidence of
you colluding with Sir Zhou

57
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,360
by saying that they kidnapped Huan?

58
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,240
No.

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,600
We're not colluding with him.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,920
It's not that serious.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,840
Father.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,920
Le.

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
You're really muddle-headed.

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
His Majesty has noticed that

65
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,240
Sir Zhou always leaks

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,080
the exam questions

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,240
and ordered me to
investigate in private.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
It's just that I didn't know

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,440
you both are in it.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
I wanted

71
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,480
to buy the questions for Le,

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,520
but

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
the questions

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
are sold at 100 taels of silver.

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,840
I

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,920
couldn't bring myself to buy it.

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,160
Father,

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,040
so you didn't want to pay for it.

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,040
Zhihuan is worth 3,000 taels of gold.

80
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
I'm not even worth 100 taels of silver.

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,600
Father,

82
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,760
you're biased.

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,680
You rascal.

84
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Is this the time

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,320
to think about this?

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,160
Yanqing,

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
what do you think

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,040
we should do about this?

89
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,840
From what you said,

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
you didn't get the questions.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
That's not collusion.

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,400
That's right.

93
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,520
That's right.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,120
However,

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,280
those people have targeted you.

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,640
They've even got Le's thumbprint
as evidence.

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,960
I'm afraid you can hardly

98
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,320
explain yourselves before His Majesty.

99
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Why not

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,160
you do this?

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,560
We've given

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
all our asset,

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
1,000 taels of gold, to them.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,920
1,000 taels of gold?

105
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm thinking

106
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,240
about your father

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,240
and your brother.

108
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
Collaborate with me

109
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,200
and I'll protect Shen family.

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,760
How does it sound?

111
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,880
(Is this a scheme?)

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,840
(It must be the bad guy
Xu Yanqing's plan.)

113
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
(He's a poke face.)

114
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,440
(He's indeed the most wicked guy
in Great Sui.)

115
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Mother,

116
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll look for them.

117
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,160
No need to look for us.

118
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,760
We're back.
