00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,480
Miss,

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
Sir Xu has saved you with his life.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,880
Are you still going to divorce Sir Xu?

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,000
I've been working in Xu family's mansion
for so long.

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,360
This is my first time seeing Sir Xu

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,080
care about someone so much.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,720
Dan Zhu,

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560
what are you trying to say?

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,120
Miss,

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,160
do you think

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,000
Sir Xu has fallen in love with you?

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,040
No way.

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,160
It's impossible.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,200
Xu Yanqing!

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,080
He has finally

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,320
exposed himself.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,840
All the assassins that day
were arrested,

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,280
but they've committed

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
suicide in jail.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
So vicious.

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,960
Did I

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,480
disturb you?

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,240
I'm leaving now.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,400
I've cooked pork ribs soup

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,360
and pumpkin porridge for you.

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,280
What would you like to have?

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,560
I'll drink

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,200
whatever you feed me.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Who said I want to feed you?

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,440
You said it in your heart.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I heard it.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,720
(So arrogant.)

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,480
What are you looking at?

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
No one is looking at you.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
You're the wife of
the Grand Secretariat.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
How can you not have any nice jewellery?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,800
(This hairpin must be expensive.)

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
(I can sell it for a good price.)

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,640
Keep it well.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,880
Don't sell it.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,880
(Can he actually read my mind?)

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,440
Master, this is bad!

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
Madam Xu has been captured!

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Someone left this behind.

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,080
He's taken action against Huan.

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,200
Be careful.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,400
The physician said you're injured
and you can't simply move.

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,360
If the wound is open,

51
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
it'll be hard to recover.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,480
Stop talking.

53
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Where's Huan been kidnapped to?

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,480
Linglong Pavilion.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,480
Prince Ye's wine tavern.

56
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,120
Let's go.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Screw it.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Where's this?

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
Huan.

60
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,920
Did you kidnap me here?

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Are you Ye Qianrui?

62
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Huan, you're indeed
General Shen's daughter.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,320
In the entire capital,

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,080
only my father would call me
by my name

65
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
besides you.

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,880
Huan, I like how you call my name.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
It shows that we're close.

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,680
(You're young but you're ingratiating.)

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,440
(I think you're the worst.)

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
Why did you look for me?

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,720
I need your help.

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
Useless brat, go out.
