Shen Zhihuan,

4
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,200
actually, I've brought you here

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,360
to tell you that

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,720
I'm a normal man

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,440
even though there are many girls

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,600
around me.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,560
(You've talked so much)

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,560
(just to divorce me.)

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,880
Dear,

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,640
you don't have to tell me all these.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,240
I understand.

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,360
Do you really understand?

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,400
I know that

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,640
it's normal to have a few wives

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,240
in your era.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,800
Furthermore,
you're the Grand Secretariat.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,200
No worries.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,520
I'll withdraw myself.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's end this well.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,120
Shen Zhihuan.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
I don't plan to let you go.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
But, don't you hate me?

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
I hate the previous Shen Zhihuan.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,040
You're different.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,840
You and her

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,000
are different even though

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
you're in the same body.

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
Aren't you afraid

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,920
of such a creepy thing?

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,720
I wasn't afraid.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,720
From now on,

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,080
I'm getting scared.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,080
Scared?

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,760
What are you scared of?

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm scared that you'd divorce me.

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm scared that you'd look
for the pretty boys in the list.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,760
(Is he)

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,120
(confessing to me?)

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,840
Yes.

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,720
Yes?

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes what?

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,040
Why do I keep feeling that
you can read my mind?

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Huan,

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,680
my only wish is that
you can stay by my side.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
(This is)

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
(his confession.)

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,680
(This is my first kiss.)

51
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Huan.

52
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Forget it.

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,640
Let's go about it.

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,600
No matter you'll become a good minister
or a bad one,

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,200
you're Shen Zhihuan's boyfriend
from now on.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,920
Boyfriend?

57
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,460
Xu Yanqing.

58
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,540
Cheers.

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,040
Miss,

60
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
did you cook all these?

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,680
I cooked it with Yanqing.

62
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
I must give it a try.

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Dig in.

64
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
This is nice.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,240
Try this.

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,960
This is nice, too.

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,200
This morning,

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
I've found something.

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,440
Let me read it out loud.

70
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,160
Divorce settlement agreement?

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,360
From now on,

72
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,560
don't mention divorce anymore.

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,760
(Since I've found my true love here,)

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,040
(I'll stay here for him.)
