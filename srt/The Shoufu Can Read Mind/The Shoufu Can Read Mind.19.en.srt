3
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Try this.

4
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,640
This is...

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
Pearl milk tea.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,880
Can this

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
be drunk?

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
I'll pour it away
if you don't want to drink it.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,400
It seems like you have a sweet tooth.

10
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,120
I don't know.

11
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,280
Besides sourness,

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,280
everything else I eat

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,800
is the same.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,680
How come you don't know
what taste you like?

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
When I was little,

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,000
my mother never kept any food for me.

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,400
I can only eat

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,360
the wild fruits on the mountain.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,760
After a long time,

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,320
the taste of the wild fruits

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,880
has been kept in my heart.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,040
(Maybe that's the reason he's isolated.)

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,400
What?

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,200
Since you've saved me again,

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,480
wait for a while.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Lava salted-egg pie.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,960
It's salty.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,080
Candied sweet potato.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,480
It's sweet.

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,600
Chop bell pepper fish head.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,920
It's spicy.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,800
Spiced chicken with chili sauce.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,120
I've made it less spicy.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,520
It's slightly numbing.

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
Stir-fried bitter melon.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,000
It's bitter.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
Try them all

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
and tell me which taste you like.

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,080
After all,

40
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm not sure about others,

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,280
but whenever I'm not happy,

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,440
I'll eat many nice foods.

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,360
if you don't know what you like to eat,

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,680
you'll lose a lot of fun.

45
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Shen Zhihuan.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,960
Well...

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,760
We...

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,820
Forget it.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,700
Let's eat.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
(The edict is here!)

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,360
(Prince Ye Qianrui has been using
the benefits of the imperial court)

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
(to commit crimes)

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
(and form cliques.)

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,400
It has ruined
the royal family's reputation.

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
He'll be sent back to his own territory

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,160
and can never come back
unless summoned.

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,520
Father!

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,220
I was accused wrongly!

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,940
Father!

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,280
Father, I seek your audience!

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,500
Father!

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,440
The edict is here!

63
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,620
(Edict)

64

(Edict)

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
(Edict)
He'll be awarded 3,000 taels of gold

69
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
and a precious sword.

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
I hope he'll continue to
serve the country

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
by getting rid of the wicked.

72
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,600
Xu Yanqing,

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,040
receive the edict.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

75
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,520
They've left.

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,480
Why are you still kneeling down?

77
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,200
Dear,

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,160
does His Majesty's reward

79
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,520
belong to both of us?

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,040
We're not divorced yet.

81
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,120
Do I own a part of it?

82
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,380
Is that right?

83
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
(I can read Shen Zhihuan's mind.)

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,480
(I think god is helping me.)

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
(I must confess my love to her today.)

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Dear,

87
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,400
you wanted to bring me here?

88
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,000
How is it?

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,680
Not bad, right?

90
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,120
It's beautiful.

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,640
This place is nice.

92

Shen Zhihuan,

93
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,160
actually, I've brought you here

94
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,320
to tell you that

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
I'm a normal man

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,400
even though there are many girls

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
around me.

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,520
(You've talked so much)

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,520
(just to divorce me.)
