Why not

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,480
we go to bed?

5
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
I suddenly remember

6
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
that I have something on.

7
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
To be honest,

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,320
I

9
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
am quite busy.

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,320
What's the matter?

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,800
Dear,

12
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,480
if you

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,080
are tired,

14
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,040
why not you sleep first?

15
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,000
No need to wait for me.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll do my things now.

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,000
Sweet potato!

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Fresh sweet potato!

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
It's nice and cheap!

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,240
Come here!

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,480
Come by

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
and don't miss it!

23
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Sweet potato!

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
It's nice and cheap!

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,520
Roasted sweet potato?

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,120
Yes!

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,760
Give me a big one.

28
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,560
Sure!

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,400
How much is it?

30
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,920
Look at the foodie.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
She keeps eating.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,040
Thank you.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,200
Be careful, it's hot.

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,760
Sweet potato!

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:43,920
Master,

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,120
should we go and take a look?

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,040
Let's go.

38
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,480
Xu Yanqing is such a bad guy.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,000
He must have done a lot of bad deeds

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
that others are here to take revenge.

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,320
I don't want to look at it.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Xu Yanqing, watch out!

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,520
Xu Yanqing!

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
You're seeking death.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Master!

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Xu Yanqing!

47
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,320
Xu Yanqing!

48
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,840
Xu Yanqing!

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
His Majesty bestowed our marriage.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,120
Divorcing you

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,800
is lying to His Majesty.

52
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,320
Don't worry.

53
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,440
I'll treat you well.

54
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,560
You...

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
You...

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
What are you doing?

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,920
(Is she)

58
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,120
(acting cute?)

59
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,140
Yanqing.
