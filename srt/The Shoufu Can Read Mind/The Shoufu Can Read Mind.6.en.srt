Put me down!

Miss!

00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,280
Yanqing!

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,240
Open the door!

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,880
Put me down!

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,560
Keep screaming.

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,720
Stop only after

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,320
they've left.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm not a dog.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,760
Why should I be screaming?

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,840
If you're not screaming,

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,440
I don't mind

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,280
getting you...

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,920
Stop it!

(Bad guy.)

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
So, Yanqing is not ill.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Shen Zhihuan

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,360
lied to me again.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,640
It's over.

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
It's really over.

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,400
Miss,

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,440
how can I help you?

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,800
Why should you help her?

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,720
Let's go.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,400
They've left.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Stop screaming.

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,320
You asked me to scream

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,080
and now you're asking me to stop.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,440
Why should I listen to you?

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I just want to keep screaming.

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,200
Let go of me!

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,480
Stop making noise.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,520
Let go of me!

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,960
No,

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,680
why are you tying me up?

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm thinking about

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
your father

40
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,920
and your brother.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,960
(Could it be)

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,920
(the cheating of
the imperial examination?)

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,120
What do you mean?

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Earlier on,

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
I found out that

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,600
your father always brought your brother

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,160
to meet Sir Zhou, the Minister of Rites.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
Since they're your family,

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,360
I took note of that

50
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,080
and I found out something interesting.

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
(Did the unreliable father and son)

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,160
(do something and it was found out)

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,400
(by this bad guy?)

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,640
Collaborate with me

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
and I'll protect Shen family.

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,680
How does it sound?

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,680
Is this how your treat your partner?

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't think so.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,800
(Bad guy.)

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,480
(You're asking Shen family
to be the front-liners)

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,200
(and you're just hiding behind
and waiting for the benefits.)

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,720
(I won't let you succeed.)

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
(Tomorrow, no matter what,)

64
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
(I'll ask the father and son
of Shen family)

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,320
(to give up on
the imperial examination.)

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
(So, that's what you're thinking.)

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Dear,

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,080
it's getting late.

69
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,440
You should rest.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,720
Tomorrow,

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,320
we'll need to go to
Shen family's residence.

72
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,640
What?

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
You're reluctant to let me go?

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Untie me.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
Dear, you're

76
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
always behaving strangely.

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,920
You don't look like
you'll sleep lying down.

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't worry.

79
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,600
I'll let the servants know

80
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,800
so that they won't disturb you.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Come back!

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,040
Somebody!

83
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Untie me!

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,320
Somebody!

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
Dan Zhu!

86
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,600
Bad guy!

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,760
Yes.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,400
The show is about to go down.
