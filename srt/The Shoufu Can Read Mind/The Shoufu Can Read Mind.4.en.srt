You need to return the favour.

You lowly servant!

You're just a hostess

Sir,

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm really sincere in thanking Madam Xu.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,760
I'm afraid what she's doing

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
will ruin your reputation.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,440
That's right.

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,000
Dear,

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,040
look at how jealous I can get.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:23,800
Why not

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,440
you just divorce me?

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,800
Or I can just divorce you.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
Otherwise, if someone exposes

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,720
the fact that

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,400
you favour your consort
over your wife,

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,040
even if you're the Grand Secretariat,

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
others will criticise you.

(Why is she so daring?)

00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,680
Sir.

That's right, dear.

Help her.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
Look at how pitiful she is.

(Let's divorce.)

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
His Majesty bestowed our marriage.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,680
Divorcing you

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
is lying to His Majesty.

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,880
Don't worry.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll treat you well.

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,280
I thought you're agile

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,320
and you'll duck.

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,720
I didn't know

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
your kicking skill

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,240
is so swift.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,680
Please rest well, sir.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,800
Sir?

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
Shouldn't you call me "dear"?

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,880
If there's nothing else,

58
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,960
just rest well.

59
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm leaving now.

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm quite busy.

61

Hold on.

62
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
I've been neglecting you

63
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
for I was busy

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
with my work.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,680
Tonight,

66

you and I

67
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,920
will consummate the marriage.

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,360
Consummate the marriage?

69
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
No.

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,400
We can be

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
soulmates.

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,760
I heard that

73

your brother is participating
in this year's imperial examination,

74

but from what I know,

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,520
in this period of time,

76
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,680
your father

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,920
has been bringing him to

78
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,120
see Minister of Rites, Sir Zhou.

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
Why not I investigate this?

80
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
(If I remember correctly,)

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
(the cheaters in this year's
imperial examination were exposed.)

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
(His Majesty was angry)

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
(and punished a lot of people.)

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,680
(If Shen family is involved...)

85
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,120
Dear,

86
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
we're a family, right?

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Family should help each other, right?

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Aren't we soulmates?

89
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,160
How come we're a family now?

90
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,440
Then

91
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
shouldn't you prepare

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,920
for tonight's consummation?

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,480
Miss,

94
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,280
it's great.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,480
You can finally consummate with Sir Xu.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Let me help you.

97
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,240
Are you moving into his room?

What's so great?

99
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,760
Go and see

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,840
what else is expensive.

101
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,640
This has been

102
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
your wish.

103
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,320
I'm happy for you.

104
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Why are you so happy?

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,960
Go and get ready.

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,920
Are we getting ready to take a shower?

107
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
Right away.

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Why are you getting ready of that?

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm not going to consummate with him.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
You're my brother's wife.

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,440
Consummating with him

112
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,320
is reasonable.

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,640
What?

114
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,960
You're not willing to do that?
