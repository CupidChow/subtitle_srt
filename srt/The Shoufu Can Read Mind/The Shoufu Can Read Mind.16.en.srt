00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
What do you think?

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,640
Your Highness,

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
why did you...

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,760
Why did I try to kill
the Grand Secretariat

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,280
on the street?

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,680
Zhou Kaiping

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,560
has been punished and executed
for the imperial examination case,

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,240
but Xu Yanqing is still investigating.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,480
He's even suspecting me now.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,000
I have to teach him a lesson.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,480
Ouyang Yu,

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,880
don't forget.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,960
When I sent you to Xu Yanqing's side,

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,000
I wanted you to get
Xu Yanqing on my side

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
to help me.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
Are you in love with him now?

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,040
I...

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,080
I know that

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,400
Xu Yanqing is a reliable man,

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,600
but don't forget that

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,800
he's a minister and I'm a prince.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,240
No matter how much
authority Xu Yanqing has,

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,120
he's just a servant that
I can kill any time.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,480
Do you understand?

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,360
Physician,

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,240
how is it?

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,160
Is he going to die?

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,360
Although the arrow
didn't hit his organs,

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,760
his wound has become black.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
It means the arrow was poisonous.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm not too confident.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Please, physician.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Please save him.

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm a physician.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,160
Of course I'd try my best.

43
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,120
Physician.

44
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,200
I've done

45
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,640
everything that I could.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
Now,

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,160
we'll have to wait for three days

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,480
and see if he could make it.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,240
Thank you.

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,440
See you.

52

Don't go crazy.
