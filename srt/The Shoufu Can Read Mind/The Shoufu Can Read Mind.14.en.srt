Miss,

4
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,920
what's this?

5
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,760
It looks tasty.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,840
You're a foodie.

7
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,360
You're really here.

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Is

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,080
there anything?

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,960
It's been a while

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,240
yet you haven't come to greet me.

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,160
That's why I came here to see

13
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,840
if you still respect me

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,680
or not.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,680
What about you?

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,880
You didn't get enough slap from me?

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,680
You...

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,240
How dare you!

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
She's my people.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,160
You should respect her because of me.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,800
What she meant is that

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,920
you're her dog.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
You're rude.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Do you think I knead dough for nothing?

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
How could you do this to Old Madam Xu?

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,520
What are you doing?

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,920
Yanqing.

28

Ouyang Yu,

29
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
didn't I ask you not to come out?

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
I missed you, Sir Xu...

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,800
and Madam Xu.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,160
Yanqing,

33
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
you're the Grand Secretariat.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
You're busy with work.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,480
I'll take care of

36
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,040
the family matters.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,880
Mother,

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,320
if you have nothing to do,

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
I can arrange some fields

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,840
for you to work on.

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,840
Yu,

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,160
let's go.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,400
Is the meal ready?

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,200
If they had stayed,

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
the noodles are going to be soggy.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,720
This is not yours.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,920
Miss,

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,480
isn't it the same?

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,440
Here.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,520
Eat yours.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,520
Miss,

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,440
why don't we have an egg?

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,280
He eats a lot.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm afraid

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
he'd say that

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
he's still hungry

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
and it'll ruin my reputation.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,800
Open the door.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,520
Sir Zhou.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
It's been a while.

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,040
Sir Xu.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,880
Sir Xu.

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,480
Please beg His Majesty for me.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Sir Zhou, that'd depend on

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
whether you'd tell me the truth or not.

66
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,240
What do you mean?

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,440
I've told you

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,760
everything.

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
You're just the Minister of Rites

70
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,840
and yet you've been

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,520
controlling the imperial examination
for years

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,800
and making your people
the local authority everywhere.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
I have got the valid evidence.

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,000
All the officers that you assigned

75
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,120
have controlled the army
of the three provinces of Great Sui.

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,120
This is not just favouritism,

77
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
but rebellion.

78
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,880
Sir Zhou,

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
this is the crime that your whole clan
will be sentenced to death.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,760
Sir.

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Sir.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,040
I...

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,200
I'll tell you.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,560
I'll tell you.
