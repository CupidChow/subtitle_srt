1
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,916
Isn’t that Ma’am Luna?

2
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:33,150
- Ma'am Luna, please get down there!
- Ma'am Luna!

3
00:03:33,175 --> 00:03:34,843
Get down from there!

4
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:47,242
Please don't jump, Ma'am!

5
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:19,986
Oh, no!

6
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:40,138
Ma’am, I’m done with the test.

7
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:26,921
Hi, Babe!

8
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:28,714
Hey, Babe. What’s that?

9
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,468
- I brought pizza. It’s still warm.
- Pizza.

10
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:36,359
Sir, please don’t fire me.
My wife is ill.

11
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:38,982
That’s your problem.

12
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,719
Had you been working hard,
I wouldn’t have fired you.

13
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:48,391
But, no. It’s been three days
and you haven’t finished the job yet.

14
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:53,647
But, Sir, the deliveries are delayed.
And we haven’t paid the suppliers yet.

15
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,591
Take care of him.

16
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,869
Yes, Sir. Let’s go!

17
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:01,330
Sir, please. I beg you, Sir.

18
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,499
- Don’t fire me, Sir.
- Go!

19
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,002
I beg you.

20
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,420
Boss!

21
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:12,791
You’re early.

22
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:16,095
My plans with Auntie got postponed.

23
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:21,191
Let’s eat.

24
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,972
Always better when it’s warm.

25
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,266
It's so good.

26
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,240
Do you know what tastes better?

27
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:37,742
You.

28
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,580
Wasn’t that Caloy?

29
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:43,414
Oh.

30
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,323
​Isn't he hardworking?

31
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:49,465
Don't meddle in my business.

32
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,853
Just prepare our dinner.

33
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:57,261
Let me take this, Ma’am.

34
00:07:57,286 --> 00:08:00,672
No, it’s fine. I’ll help you
prepare dinner.

35
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,398
Where do you think you’re going.

36
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:15,847
You’re mine. I won’t stop.

37
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,117
​Enough. Please stop.

38
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:39,002
Babe, does the shampoo model
always have to be a sexy girl?

39
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:41,896
The consumers are just
ordinary girls, anyway.

40
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:46,227
So, why not use an ordinary woman?
Like Ms. Bebang?

41
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:48,229
Because, Babe, we’re selling a fantasy.

42
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:51,423
What the buyer could be.
Not what she is.

43
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:56,070
And why do you always
need to show the cleavage?

44
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:59,699
I can’t see the connection
between "boobs" and "shampoo."

45
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,851
Unless we’re supposed to shampoo our boobs.

46
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:05,570
Come on, Babe. Don’t be naïve.
We’re selling the whole package.

47
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,457
From the head to the…

48
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,675
Now I'm the naïve one?

49
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,747
I have work to do.

50
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:18,308
My deadline is in two weeks.

51
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,377
Us first.

52
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,639
The script can wait.

53
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,264
Make the script really sexy,

54
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:35,729
like you.

55
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:33,874
Fuck. It's so good.

56
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,853
Abe, stop. Does it
have to be every night?

57
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:55,305
You smell like medicinal oil.

58
00:10:56,982 --> 00:11:00,736
Fool! You'll like it anyway!

59
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:03,259
​You’re so good, Arnold.

60
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,512
You’re better.

61
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:07,925
No. You’re better.

62
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,613
Do you really need to mind that?

63
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:30,274
I want to leave him, Auntie.
I can’t take it anymore.

64
00:12:31,005 --> 00:12:34,118
I signed an agreement, Luna.

65
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,299
You’re up to your eyeballs in debt.
He’s not going to let you go.

66
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,719
Every time I go out of the house,
I feel like running away.

67
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:45,032
Just be patient.

68
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:49,261
I really don’t understand
why you still choose to work.

69
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:52,932
It’s the only time
I can escape from him.

70
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,769
He doesn’t treat his workers well, Auntie.

71
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,053
He treats them like slaves.

72
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,599
​That’s none of your business.

73
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,910
So, it’s also about control?

74
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:15,287
Not about who has
the say in the relationship?

75
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,666
Love should not be
equal to subservience.

76
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:24,171
Yes, from household chores
up to their sexual activities,

77
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:27,675
​including which brand
of toothpaste to buy,

78
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:31,387
or whose turn is it
to do the dishes,

79
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,389
it’s a question of who is in control.

80
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,682
I don’t agree.

81
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:39,979
Lines get blurred
when two people are in love.

82
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,731
It doesn’t matter
who has control.

83
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,483
Love is love.

84
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,069
So, what do you think?

85
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:49,780
Love should not be equal to subservience.

86
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:53,576
I personally don't mind doing
what my boyfriend wants me to do.

87
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:59,498
I don’t feel diminished
when I give him what he wants.

88
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,749
I love him.

89
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,834
Love is love.

90
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,919
I want him to be happy.

91
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,880
Love should not be equal to subservience.

92
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:07,982
Love is love.

93
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:10,676
Love should not be
equal to subservience.

94
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:15,139
- Love is love.
- Love should not be equal to subservience.

95
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,142
- Love is love.
- Love should not be equal to subservience.

96
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,894
Love is love.

97
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,094
Roger!

98
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:20,891
​Stop or I’ll kill her!

99
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:24,833
Don’t come closer.

100
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,103
I'm not kidding!

101
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,264
Hand me the keys!

102
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,391
​I'm on my way home.

103
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:42,017
Just hand me the keys! Hurry!

104
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:44,269
I’ll shoot you. Hurry!

105
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,962
Run!

106
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:48,093
What are you doing?

107
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:49,344
My glasses.

108
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:51,052
Hurry!

109
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:09,398
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just need to get away.

110
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:37,906
I beg you. Please let me go.

111
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:41,076
Fuck! Shut up!

112
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,305
Get out! Hurry up!

113
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,432
Listen to me!

114
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,893
Come on! Someone might see us here.

115
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,603
Listen! Hurry!

116
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,775
- Where are you going?
- ​You don’t need me anymore.

117
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,359
Why don’t you just run away?

118
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,947
I’m sorry, but I need you
until I am sure I wasn’t followed.

119
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:23,282
Get in! Go. Get inside.

120
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,843
They're going for the both of us.

121
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:43,180
Stop fidgeting! Be grateful
I'm holding a gun.

122
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:47,657
Are you seriously about to piss yourself?

123
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:50,204
Let’s look for a bathroom upstairs. Relax!

124
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,338
You're going to get us both hurt!

125
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,852
Where are you going?
Don’t you dare!

126
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,483
Roger!

127
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,492
Damn this life!

128
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,571
Roger!

129
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,086
Roger!

130
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,101
Fuck! Where are you going? Sit down!

131
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,651
Just do what I say
if you don’t want to get hurt.

132
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:36,676
Sit!

133
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:29,656
Hey!

134
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:31,758
Where are you going?

135
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,110
Let go of me!

136
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:41,586
Shut up!

137
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:48,341
Don’t tie me up.
I won’t try to get away.

138
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:52,508
- Please don’t tie me up.
- Not gonna happen. Sit down!

139
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:56,149
Where's your phone?

140
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,196
You’re such a pain in the ass!

141
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:24,211
Please, I beg you.
Untie me.

142
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:29,974
Tomorrow, once I’m sure
we weren’t followed,

143
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:31,882
I’ll set you free.

144
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:36,860
Wouldn’t it be easier for you
if you don’t drag me along?

145
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:42,040
Didn’t you hear what I said?
I’ll let you go tomorrow.

146
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:46,083
It was so wrong
for you to take me.

147
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,182
You shouldn’t have involved me.

148
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:52,413
Will you shut up?

149
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:57,026
What if they saw the cab?

150
00:22:58,324 --> 00:23:03,496
What if they find us?
You should have just ran away.

151
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,157
I said, shut up!

152
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:25,554
I have to go to the bathroom.
I need to pee.

153
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:29,151
And attempt to run away again?

154
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,143
Would you like me to take a leak here?

155
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,147
I won't run away. Promise.

156
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:38,400
Can you untie these?

157
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,732
"Don’t use the bathroom. It's out of order.
Use the bathroom outside."

158
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,731
What are you waiting for? Get in.

159
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,258
Wait.

160
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,289
Can’t you read?

161
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,281
The toilet’s clogged.

162
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,082
Clogged...

163
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,479
I’ll just pee outside.

164
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:00,482
No. You can’t go out.

165
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,949
Untie me, please.

166
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:12,411
Remove it yourself. Pee quickly. Come on.

167
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,242
Chief, it's been hours and you still
haven't found my wife.

168
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,013
You don't have any leads.

169
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:45,971
She's my wife.

170
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:47,289
Calm down, Abe.

171
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,543
Sir, what’s happening here?
Why are you not giving us any update?

172
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,869
We’ve been waiting for hours.

173
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,963
Thank you very much, Mr. Dizon.
This is a big deal for me and Bela.

174
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:06,706
As long as this will profit like we agreed.

175
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,275
We’ll do our best. For sure.
We’ll do our best.

176
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:12,230
- You have to make it sexy.
- Sexy.

177
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,733
- People want to see sex.
- Okay...

178
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,693
Bela’s already working on it.

179
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:18,570
Mr. Dizon, may I add...

180
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:23,158
your concepts are brilliant.
How do you even come up with them?

181
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:25,035
- Really?
- Yes.

182
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:27,537
I’ve got more where those came from.

183
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,915
My wife even said
that I should be a writer.

184
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,667
- See? A writer.
- I told her

185
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,588
a businessman is like a writer.
Both sell their products.

186
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,914
They're salesmen.

187
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:41,551
Am I right, Bela? Bela, right?

188
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,345
Yes, Sir.

189
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:45,597
But no, Sir.

190
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:48,516
I don’t think I got you right.

191
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,519
It depends on what’s being sold.

192
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,857
But we are not “salesmen.”

193
00:26:55,882 --> 00:27:01,429
Although, I think that “salesperson”
is more appropriate.

194
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:07,494
It seems like you’ve been writing
a very good script, Arnold.

195
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:11,039
- For sure, it is, Mr. Dizon.
- This Bela seems good.

196
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,833
I like women who have ideas.

197
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:17,504
They’re fun to converse with.

198
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:21,591
So, when can I read the script?

199
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,385
Very soon, Sir.

200
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:25,595
I need time, Sir.

201
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:29,849
I would like to read
whatever you’ve finished.

202
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:33,269
I’m leaving for Belgium next week.

203
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:38,733
I can’t let you read it
until it’s done, Sir.

204
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,322
Because any changes to the last part
will affect the first part.

205
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:49,327
I don’t mind. Just don’t remove
the parts that I want.

206
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,419
Yup. We won’t.

207
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:54,666
I need you to be proactive.

208
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,876
- Proactive.
- More than breast exposure,

209
00:27:56,918 --> 00:27:58,911
there should be some action.

210
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:02,956
Fondling or… whatever.

211
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:06,126
You know what I mean.

212
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:07,679
Friday, Sir.

213
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:09,431
Good!

214
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:15,019
The budget’s too small
for his expectations.

215
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:18,106
Let it go, Babe. We’re lucky
to have found a producer.

216
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:23,445
We should have just entered Cinemalaya
to make the film we really wanted to make.

217
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,272
We would still need a producer.

218
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,944
And besides, Mr. Dizon doesn’t want
to join Cinemalaya.

219
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:33,346
What if we propose a new material?

220
00:28:33,371 --> 00:28:34,372
Babe...

221
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:36,613
Not as sexual as he wants.

222
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:39,558
Babe... that’s his material.

223
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:43,664
Changing it would offend him.

224
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:48,085
Why does everybody think
they can be writers?

225
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:52,798
Just because they come up with a concept
doesn’t mean they can write a screenplay.

226
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:54,633
That’s just a concept.

227
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:58,846
I agree. I understand you, okay?

228
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:03,100
But, please. Do this for me.

229
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:08,605
Why don’t you write it yourself, Babe?
You can do it.

230
00:29:09,866 --> 00:29:11,733
You just need more confidence.

231
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:15,529
But, Babe.

232
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,115
- Why?
- I’m not a writer. You know that.

233
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:26,915
Sometimes I ask myself if
I’m really ready to direct, or…

234
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,501
maybe I’m just rushing.

235
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:37,426
You can do it. Whenever
you have doubts,

236
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,024
flashback!

237
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,276
Five years ago, do you remember
when we were at the UP lagoon?

238
00:29:45,318 --> 00:29:48,835
We were lying down on
the grass, under the stars,

239
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,023
and we were dreaming
of our future.

240
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,203
You know what I remember from the lagoon?

241
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:56,246
What?

242
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:57,972
We had perfect sex.

243
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, you! Well…

244
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,586
It was good sex.
But it was more than that.

245
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:04,629
Of course.

246
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:09,708
We made a promise that you will become
a director and I, a scriptwriter.

247
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:14,556
You achieved yours. Three of your scripts
have been made into films.

248
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:18,258
You can do it, too. Your dream.

249
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:22,930
Our dream.

250
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:12,026
We’re lucky to find food here
and you’re not even eating.

251
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:13,910
Eat a little.

252
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:17,682
I’m sorry about
what happened to your friend.

253
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,413
I’m Luna.

254
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,389
How about you? What’s your name?

255
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:50,757
I know you’re not a criminal.

256
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:52,696
And...

257
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:56,930
I know why you don’t want to let me go.

258
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,933
You’re afraid to be alone.

259
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:04,771
You have no idea what to do
now that your buddy is gone.

260
00:36:07,658 --> 00:36:09,317
I can help you.

261
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:16,542
If you surrender, I’ll tell them
you’ve been nice to me.

262
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,128
My husband might know someone.

263
00:36:21,297 --> 00:36:22,998
He’s got connections.

264
00:36:23,753 --> 00:36:25,250
He’ll help you.

265
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:30,681
Get off my back!

266
00:36:31,057 --> 00:36:33,268
Get off my back!

267
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,526
I’m sorry about the things I said.

268
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:38,490
I was blabbering because I was nervous.

269
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,375
I’m sorry if I aimed my gun at you.

270
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,628
I’m not a bad person.

271
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,505
I know.

272
00:37:56,325 --> 00:38:01,721
We are not bad people.
The money we stole, it was ours.

273
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:09,521
Money that was being robbed from us,
workers, by Sir Louie.

274
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:13,650
And then he would
fire people just like that.

275
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:21,282
But your buddy is gone.
You’re alone now.

276
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:27,205
Instead of hiding,
you can turn yourself in.

277
00:38:28,197 --> 00:38:30,208
You’ll have a chance to change.

278
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,128
But it’s too late.

279
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,133
It’s never too late when
doing the right thing.

280
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:43,054
Earlier at the bathroom,

281
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:45,557
I noticed that...

282
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:50,311
you can not read.

283
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:55,567
There’s nothing to be ashamed of.

284
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,405
Maybe, you weren’t given
a chance to study.

285
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:07,903
If you won't turn yourself in,
what is your plan?

286
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:10,665
I have no idea.

287
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,503
Uncle Roger, my buddy, planned
everything, where we should go,

288
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,557
what to do with the money...

289
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,358
But now that he’s gone,

290
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:26,823
I feel lost. Uncle Roger
was like a father to me.

291
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:29,142
He took me out of the streets.

292
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:34,939
You know what? Life hasn’t been
that good to me either.

293
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:40,820
My mom, she needed to undergo surgery.

294
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:46,242
But hospitals wouldn’t accept us
because we can’t afford it.

295
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:50,747
Our medical bills reached a million.

296
00:39:51,799 --> 00:39:53,958
So I married Abe.

297
00:39:56,512 --> 00:40:00,690
He took care of the bills.
Now I'm stuck with him.

298
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:05,845
How’s your mother now?

299
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:12,060
She died two weeks after the surgery.

300
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,652
Thank you.

301
00:41:58,008 --> 00:42:01,794
I only reached second grade.

302
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:04,714
So I didn’t learn how to read.

303
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,967
Where were your parents?

304
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:10,345
I don’t know.

305
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:17,060
I was essentially an orphan
until Uncle Roger took me in.

306
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:20,229
I married his daughter, Nelia.

307
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,108
But she died giving birth.

308
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,878
What was your job at the factory?

309
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:30,294
They hired you despite
being unable to read?

310
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,854
I worked different jobs at the factory
given my limitation.

311
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:37,956
It was Uncle Roger who brought me in, too.

312
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:42,945
But that factory treated us like slaves.

313
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:46,189
It must be a struggle
not knowing how to read.

314
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,859
I don't need to know how.

315
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,680
I read the things around me
but not through letters of the alphabet.

316
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:55,848
What do you mean?

317
00:42:56,275 --> 00:43:01,187
Every object has a written name, right?

318
00:43:04,408 --> 00:43:09,278
Instead of reading their names,
I observe them.

319
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:27,505
A chair, a piece of steel,
a wall, a pillow...

320
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:30,508
Everything is alive to me.

321
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:37,490
I can hear them. All I need
to do is close my eyes,

322
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:41,102
and listen to their heartbeat.

323
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:45,706
I don’t need to learn
how to write their names

324
00:43:45,949 --> 00:43:48,871
because I’ve always
known who they are.

325
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,115
All you need to do is touch them,

326
00:43:54,325 --> 00:44:02,206
close your eyes,
and try to feel their heartbeat.

327
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:22,540
How’s it going?

328
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,092
I can’t do it.

329
00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:30,558
Why, Babe? Is there a problem?

330
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:33,928
They’ll have sex just like that?

331
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:38,383
The woman will give in
on their first night?

332
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:41,527
Why not? That can happen.

333
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:43,061
Luna is sexy.

334
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,622
She doesn’t love her husband.

335
00:48:44,764 --> 00:48:45,964
Diego is a man.

336
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:48,203
It’s wrong.

337
00:48:48,228 --> 00:48:50,094
Well then, you can change it
if you want.

338
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:56,709
I think it’s actually better if
Luna resists then Diego rapes her.

339
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:06,703
No. What I mean is why does
everything have to lead to sex?

340
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:09,539
That’s one of Mr. Dizon’s suggestions.

341
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:13,360
Sex while the girl is tied up. Remember?

342
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:16,645
So I don’t understand
why you untied her.

343
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:19,275
No…

344
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,236
I don’t want the girl to seem subjugated.

345
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:28,074
She shouldn’t be tied up.

346
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:33,954
But is that not the theme of your story?

347
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,335
That she has no freedom,

348
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:39,668
and this will be her liberation.

349
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:45,758
She is a hostage not just at the house,
but in her marriage as well.

350
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:47,993
And the guy is her savior?

351
00:49:48,078 --> 00:49:50,038
Why not? Isn’t that
the story's direction?

352
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:55,038
Does a girl have no purpose other than sex?

353
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,661
Can we just let him have this?

354
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:00,508
Let’s just give Mr. Dizon what he wants.

355
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:05,345
I swear it won’t look gratuitous
when I mount the sex scene.

356
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:08,114
What if we reverse their roles?

357
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:11,374
Luna becomes the abductor.

358
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,812
No! Please!

359
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:15,955
Or Diego is a ghost.

360
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:20,440
He was shot and killed
along with his buddy.

361
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:28,994
Sex with a ghost? That isn’t sexy.
Babe, let’s not make this difficult for us.

362
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:34,098
Let’s just give Mr. Dizon
what he wants so he won’t back out.

363
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:40,882
Alright, fine. You write it
how you want it, okay?

364
00:50:41,346 --> 00:50:45,067
But please meet the deadline. Okay?

365
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:50,281
We might just convince Mr. Dizon.
Just please finish it.

366
00:50:50,892 --> 00:50:55,619
I have an idea! This is what I’ll do.

367
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:03,310
It will be a sex scene,
but it’s not physical.

368
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:06,755
They will make love through words.

369
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,136
She teaches him how to write the names
of the parts of the body.

370
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:23,522
She spells the words..

371
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:26,885
S...

372
00:51:27,025 --> 00:51:28,568
And he spells them back.

373
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:29,820
S...

374
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:37,838
- U...
- U...

375
00:51:39,047 --> 00:51:42,259
- S...
- S...

376
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,573
- O...
- O...

377
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:47,448
Breast...

378
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,455
Breast.

379
00:52:01,653 --> 00:52:04,698
- H...
- H...

380
00:52:04,723 --> 00:52:06,549
- I...
- I...

381
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:12,947
- T...
- T...

382
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:20,755
- A...
- A...

383
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,457
- Thigh.
- Thigh.

384
00:52:36,646 --> 00:52:39,098
- L...
- L...

385
00:52:41,948 --> 00:52:44,144
- A...
- A...

386
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,911
B...

387
00:52:51,342 --> 00:52:52,625
B...

388
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:56,374
- I...
- I...

389
00:52:57,334 --> 00:53:00,578
- Lips.
- Lips.

390
00:53:01,157 --> 00:53:05,776
Lips, thigh, breast.

391
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:10,526
It will be pure sexual tension
as they gaze at each other.

392
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:21,365
They had sex through spelling?

393
00:53:22,262 --> 00:53:23,341
Yes.

394
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:29,685
Not even kissing? Didn’t we agree
on having a bed scene?

395
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:33,736
That’s the bed scene.
It’s more poetic that way.

396
00:53:33,783 --> 00:53:38,371
What do I care about poetry?
Don’t you want to see some action?

397
00:53:38,396 --> 00:53:41,474
When there is sex, there should
be a climax, right?

398
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,576
No. Not this time.

399
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:51,037
But other investors might not agree.

400
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:55,033
Why does everything need
to have a sex scene?

401
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:57,670
Because everything revolves around it.

402
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:01,247
If not for sex, would there
be people in this world?

403
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:06,998
Maybe Bela has gone too far? She held back.
We can easily revise.

404
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:09,955
No. I don’t want to revise.

405
00:54:10,675 --> 00:54:14,042
It’s the story that
I will give a climax to.

406
00:54:14,479 --> 00:54:15,999
Not Diego and Luna.

407
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:18,795
Arnold.

408
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:22,259
Bela, what are you doing?

409
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:31,470
Baby, please. What's up?

410
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,971
Hey, do you not love me anymore?

411
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:36,457
Why do you always emotionally blackmail me?

412
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,201
What blackmail?
I’m just asking for your help.

413
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:40,591
So why do you always bend
to that delusional friend of yours?

414
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:44,395
That misogynistic, egoistic, macho guy.

415
00:54:50,864 --> 00:54:52,282
- Gardy...
- Gardy?

416
00:54:52,282 --> 00:54:53,324
Hello, Bela.

417
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:55,243
Arnold and I are
in the middle of a quarrel.

418
00:54:55,243 --> 00:54:57,287
Gardy, can you please
convince your friend

419
00:54:57,287 --> 00:54:59,613
- to stop being stubborn.
- Again?

420
00:54:59,638 --> 00:55:02,167
Gardy, please. Don’t meddle.

421
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:04,544
- I’ll talk to you later.
- Gardy, please.

422
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:11,843
Get in.

423
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:24,731
Thank you.

424
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:34,148
Remember, Babe? You first
had me in the rain.

425
00:55:35,383 --> 00:55:42,515
It was our first date then it rained hard.
The thunder and lightning scared you.

426
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,867
I’m not scared of thunder anymore.

427
00:55:44,892 --> 00:55:46,133
Really?

428
00:55:46,851 --> 00:55:51,398
I remember when you told me that
it reminded you of your father.

429
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:56,336
You embraced me as if
you never wanted to let go.

430
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,173
- I love you, Babe.
- I love you, Babe.

431
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:25,100
- I love you more.
- I love you more.

432
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:28,670
Let’s give Mr. Dizon what
he wants. Do it for me.

433
00:58:03,235 --> 00:58:06,280
So that’s it? You gave in because of sex?

434
00:58:06,305 --> 00:58:09,595
It’s not that. Don’t simplify.

435
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:13,750
Anyway, when is your deadline?
Are you going to make it?

436
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:16,193
I’m not even halfway through.

437
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:19,756
But you, you have to submit yours,
the one you told me about before.

438
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:21,756
Cinemalaya will always be there.

439
00:58:21,781 --> 00:58:23,358
Arnold needs me now.

440
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,263
So you keep postponing your dreams for him.

441
00:58:27,288 --> 00:58:29,573
May you get struck by lightning
to wake you up from your stupor.

442
00:58:30,433 --> 00:58:34,395
He’s not like you
who can write and direct.

443
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,966
It’s not about being able to.
It’s about trying to.

444
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:40,125
I work hard for it. Just like you.

445
00:58:40,397 --> 00:58:43,061
So can you please tell your boyfriend

446
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,947
to find you a project
with a decent talent fee?

447
00:58:45,556 --> 00:58:47,257
I bet you’re not even getting paid.

448
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:51,929
Oh, shit.

449
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:56,058
Seriously, I don’t know how you manage
to stay in that relationship.

450
00:58:56,671 --> 00:59:00,129
If I were to rate your relationship,
it would be three!

451
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:02,456
What? It's an eight.

452
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:04,691
Eight? I don’t see it as an eight.

453
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,859
Well, at least, our sex life is a ten.

454
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:10,739
So it’s okay for him to be an asshole
just because the sex is good?

455
00:59:11,207 --> 00:59:14,248
People who love assholes
are much bigger assholes!

456
00:59:14,273 --> 00:59:16,662
- You’re an asshole. You're crazy!
- I know.

457
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:19,264
But seriously. He visits my father.

458
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:23,418
- What?
- My monster dad.

459
00:59:28,825 --> 00:59:32,996
The famous writer who thinks
he’s entitled to terrorize our family

460
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:35,342
just because he’s good novelist.

461
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:39,601
He hurt me and my mom.
Well, nothing lasts.

462
00:59:39,626 --> 00:59:42,412
He’s now in a nursing home.
He has Alzheimer’s.

463
00:59:43,256 --> 00:59:46,259
But he’s too young to have that.
Isn’t he just in his 60’s?

464
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:51,560
Arnold consistently visits him,
once a month.

465
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:56,912
While I always find an excuse
not to visit him.

466
00:59:57,443 --> 00:59:58,927
I just can’t forgive him.

467
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:06,238
Arnold doesn’t tell me
what they talk about

468
01:00:06,818 --> 01:00:09,481
or even what he looks like now.

469
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:13,339
Because he knows that
I don’t want to hear anything.

470
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,303
So my asshole boyfriend
is actually a very sensitive person.

471
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:21,743
And I know that he will be
a good director someday.

472
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:24,980
So I’m here to help him realize that.

473
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,197
Oh, well...

474
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:31,778
Why don’t these fathers and boyfriends
just act like fathers and boyfriends?

475
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:41,705
I’ll give Mr. Dizon what he wants.

476
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:45,709
I’ll make the script very sexy.

477
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:34,452
L-A-B-I.

478
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:36,454
Lips.

479
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:38,008
Lips.

480
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:54,027
L-E-E-G.

481
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:56,022
Neck.

482
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:16,793
S-U-S-O.

483
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:19,170
Breast.

484
01:06:58,295 --> 01:07:01,876
I knew it, Babe.
I knew you had it in you.

485
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:04,254
Mr. Dizon will be pleased.

486
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:09,118
I cringe at what I wrote.

487
01:07:09,143 --> 01:07:11,120
Babe, it’s okay. It’s really good.

488
01:07:11,145 --> 01:07:14,106
- Really?
- Yes. I just have a suggestion though.

489
01:07:14,514 --> 01:07:17,017
I’m thinking of adding a little detail
to the bed scene.

490
01:07:17,042 --> 01:07:20,755
I want Diego and Luna to orgasm
at the same time.

491
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,864
What?

492
01:07:21,906 --> 01:07:24,450
What? Just like the two of us.

493
01:07:24,492 --> 01:07:25,951
That’s too much.

494
01:07:25,993 --> 01:07:27,411
Why is it too much?

495
01:07:27,453 --> 01:07:29,371
You want it to be realistic, right?

496
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,748
- Yes.
- More realistic?

497
01:07:30,773 --> 01:07:32,450
- Yes.
- Then that’s it.

498
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,453
You know what, I have an idea.

499
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:42,593
I have a friend. She’s a girl.
She’s open for a threesome.

500
01:07:42,635 --> 01:07:44,512
- No.
- Let’s just try it.

501
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:45,262
I don’t want to.

502
01:07:45,304 --> 01:07:46,880
- Just once?
- Disgusting.

503
01:07:47,515 --> 01:07:48,891
Don’t tell me you’re going to enjoy that.

504
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,645
Of course. And you’re going
to enjoy it too, Babe.

505
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,469
Don’t you want us to explore?

506
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,275
- Then what about a threesome with a guy?
- Fuck no, Babe.

507
01:07:58,317 --> 01:07:59,443
Why not?

508
01:07:59,485 --> 01:08:02,613
Babe. I’d get jealous.

509
01:08:02,655 --> 01:08:06,513
But it’s okay if it’s with a girl?
You’re so unfair!

510
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:09,752
I’m a man, Babe.
I’ve got nothing to lose.

511
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:11,472
And you know that
I’m the jealous type, right?

512
01:08:11,497 --> 01:08:15,100
Yes, you get jealous towards everyone.
Even Gardy, who’s gay!

513
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,837
Babe, that guy still has a dick.

514
01:08:17,878 --> 01:08:20,638
Whatever! I don’t want
to talk about it anymore.

515
01:08:21,161 --> 01:08:22,676
I’ll just continue writing.

516
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:30,950
Babe.

517
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:33,302
Come on.

518
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:47,481
Uncle Roger was like a father to me.

519
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:51,069
If I knew my real father,

520
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:55,349
I feel that Uncle Roger
would still be more of a father to me.

521
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:59,118
Me...

522
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:04,207
I don’t even know
if my father is kind or not.

523
01:09:06,494 --> 01:09:10,322
I saw him only thrice in my whole life.

524
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:13,967
I was sneaking peeks
in their huge house.

525
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,595
I was just a kid.

526
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:22,767
I would always think
of him as my hero,

527
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:31,150
even though I am an illegitimate child
and he never really knew me.

528
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,280
You know how heroes are in stories, right?

529
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:41,712
They’re noble, larger-than-life,

530
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:47,016
unattainable, but you still
look up to them.

531
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:55,842
One day, I went back to their house.
He was gone.

532
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,721
They migrated abroad.

533
01:10:02,136 --> 01:10:04,844
The father I thought of
as my hero was gone.

534
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,271
I haven’t seen him since.

535
01:10:17,357 --> 01:10:19,324
He was always there.

536
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:24,003
I always see him.

537
01:10:24,145 --> 01:10:30,300
Growing up, even if he wasn’t around,
I always see him.

538
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:31,919
His presence.

539
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:35,048
This monster.

540
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,426
This famous writer in our house

541
01:10:40,288 --> 01:10:42,722
who was a god-like figure of rage.

542
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,210
He would type on his manual
typewriter the whole day

543
01:10:57,258 --> 01:10:58,946
while drinking beer.

544
01:11:00,795 --> 01:11:04,494
Each hit to the typewriter key
was like a punch to my chest,

545
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:12,052
because if my mother and I
did anything to disturb his writing,

546
01:11:12,484 --> 01:11:16,589
or if we weren’t quick enough
to get him another bottle of beer,

547
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,843
he would hurt us.

548
01:11:23,006 --> 01:11:25,031
Wherever I go...

549
01:11:26,418 --> 01:11:31,048
long after my mother passed away
and I started living on my own…

550
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,858
even now that he’s in a nursing home
and doesn’t remember who I am…

551
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:41,906
I can still feel his presence.

552
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,509
I can still see him.

553
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,526
Dad.

554
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:32,290
I brought you something that you’d like.

555
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:36,695
Ordinarily, beers are not allowed in here,

556
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:41,174
but we give him an exemption
because beer helps with his tantrums.

557
01:14:36,965 --> 01:14:38,457
What about you?

558
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,501
Don’t worry about me.
I can handle this.

559
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:46,931
I don’t want to go back to Abe.
Take me with you.

560
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:54,140
I can’t. It’s dangerous.
I don’t want to put you at risk.

561
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,184
Where are you going?

562
01:14:58,445 --> 01:15:04,942
You don’t have to know. Don’t look for me.
But don’t worry, I’ll find you.

563
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:07,595
We’ll see each other again.

564
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:31,010
Can I really not go with you?

565
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,149
L...

566
01:15:50,066 --> 01:15:51,984
A...

567
01:15:58,418 --> 01:15:59,622
B...

568
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,002
I...

569
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:10,600
Lips.

570
01:16:59,623 --> 01:17:03,018
Diego. My name is Diego.

571
01:18:09,863 --> 01:18:11,504
Something happened between you two.

572
01:18:16,646 --> 01:18:21,263
Did you like it when he fucked you?

573
01:18:23,608 --> 01:18:25,184
Answer me!

574
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,439
Why won’t you answer me?

575
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:40,834
You were together the whole day,
and you’re telling me he never touched you?

576
01:18:44,129 --> 01:18:46,423
Was he better than me?

577
01:18:46,448 --> 01:18:50,118
I can’t take this anymore!

578
01:18:55,622 --> 01:18:57,540
What now?

579
01:19:05,994 --> 01:19:08,642
This feels better, doesn’t it?

580
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:50,996
Diego...

581
01:21:06,797 --> 01:21:09,091
Candy, please.

582
01:23:56,775 --> 01:23:58,860
Wow, babe. You’re so good.

583
01:23:58,902 --> 01:24:00,445
Round two later?

584
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,009
- Round three, four?
- Four?

585
01:24:07,577 --> 01:24:10,330
- Five.
- Five, six.

586
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:13,792
- Seven, eight, nine.
- Oh, Babe.

587
01:24:20,068 --> 01:24:22,040
Is it true that you’re together?

588
01:24:25,849 --> 01:24:28,998
Babe. Let me explain. Okay?

589
01:24:29,603 --> 01:24:32,009
I’m asking if it’s true.

590
01:24:35,366 --> 01:24:36,440
Yes.

591
01:24:38,723 --> 01:24:41,860
Finish your damn script yourself!

592
01:24:42,148 --> 01:24:43,942
Babe.

593
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:50,903
You betrayed me again.
This is the second time.

594
01:24:51,647 --> 01:24:58,744
I was just horny the first time.
It was just one night.

595
01:25:21,838 --> 01:25:23,006
Babe.

596
01:25:23,031 --> 01:25:24,311
This one, who is she?

597
01:25:27,282 --> 01:25:29,625
- Babe...
- I said, who is she?

598
01:25:32,454 --> 01:25:34,112
She’s Mr. Dizon’s sister.

599
01:25:42,195 --> 01:25:43,664
It’s nothing serious.

600
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:48,877
You couldn’t even mention her name
because you’re just using her.

601
01:25:49,162 --> 01:25:51,838
Because all you want is Mr. Dizon’s money.

602
01:25:54,726 --> 01:25:56,218
You’re a whore!

603
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:00,222
Get out!

604
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:06,228
I said, get out of my house!
Pack your things and go!

605
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:11,724
Rot in hell with your nameless woman.

606
01:27:10,718 --> 01:27:15,848
He’s reckless because he knows
that you’ll always take him back.

607
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,059
Your relationship has always
been like this, on repeat!

608
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:21,020
How do I get rid
of these feelings?

609
01:27:21,045 --> 01:27:26,141
You never learn. What was his reason
the first time he cheated?

610
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:30,103
He said he needed to explore...

611
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:33,908
- for his art.
- And you believed him?

612
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:35,609
I’m so stupid.

613
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:40,206
Tell him that if he wants to experiment,

614
01:27:40,265 --> 01:27:43,768
he shouldn’t be in a relationship
so he and his birdie can be set free.

615
01:27:43,793 --> 01:27:47,704
Not like this! He’s taking advantage
of your illiterate heart.

616
01:27:48,006 --> 01:27:52,844
I know. Anyway, I thought you
needed my help with your script?

617
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:54,245
You have two days to finish it, right?

618
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:57,899
Yes. But I didn’t want
to bother you anymore.

619
01:27:57,924 --> 01:28:01,821
You’re going through a lot right now.
I can handle this. And besides,

620
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:05,898
I’m writing a love story.
A subject you’re not adept at.

621
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,359
- You’re crazy!
- You’re crazy, too!

622
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:11,696
Good luck to all the writers
slaving away at their laptops,

623
01:28:11,738 --> 01:28:13,422
trying to keep up with deadlines,

624
01:28:13,447 --> 01:28:16,743
draining their minds,
hearts, and souls dry.

625
01:28:16,784 --> 01:28:20,997
Good luck to all the lovers
who never learn,

626
01:28:21,022 --> 01:28:22,849
who make fools of themselves,

627
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:27,045
- who drive themselves insane,
- who act like hopeless martyrs!

628
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:32,133
You know, if I weren’t gay, you and I
would be the perfect match!

629
01:28:32,175 --> 01:28:34,927
Look at us, we get each other!

630
01:28:34,969 --> 01:28:36,054
Don’t be silly.

631
01:28:36,095 --> 01:28:38,056
Right, that will never happen.

632
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:40,090
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

633
01:28:42,745 --> 01:28:43,969
Hey.

634
01:28:45,229 --> 01:28:49,055
Promise me that if your asshole boyfriend
wants to get back with you,

635
01:28:49,618 --> 01:28:51,298
you won’t take him back.

636
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:59,094
No matter how often he calls or
no matter how much he begs, don’t cave.

637
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:00,710
But how about the script?

638
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,238
Drop it.

639
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:04,563
What?

640
01:29:07,163 --> 01:29:08,456
Let’s just do a toast.

641
01:29:08,544 --> 01:29:11,380
That script be damned.

642
01:29:11,405 --> 01:29:14,416
- I’ll just drink to that.
- Yes, that’s right!

643
01:29:51,379 --> 01:29:54,581
I’m having doubts on whether to continue.

644
01:29:56,326 --> 01:29:57,584
Why?

645
01:29:58,928 --> 01:30:03,006
I feel that I’m writing
about myself, not about you.

646
01:30:03,933 --> 01:30:06,134
Listen to your heart.

647
01:30:07,728 --> 01:30:12,525
Sometimes I feel like I don’t know
what’s in my heart anymore.

648
01:30:12,567 --> 01:30:18,781
Sometimes, you have to write something down
in order to reveal its truth.

649
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,103
Hello?

650
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:42,932
Luna.

651
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:47,253
Yes, Diego. Where are you?

652
01:32:47,672 --> 01:32:49,381
I’ve been wanting to talk to you.

653
01:32:57,082 --> 01:33:00,350
Where are you?
Am I going to see you?

654
01:34:42,054 --> 01:34:46,383
Look at me. Let's come together.

655
01:35:53,268 --> 01:35:54,602
Get some sleep.

656
01:35:55,659 --> 01:36:00,864
I don’t want to sleep.
I just want to feel you all night.

657
01:36:21,727 --> 01:36:25,221
I thought you’ve come
to take me with you.

658
01:36:40,037 --> 01:36:43,916
This money is more than enough
for you to pay off your husband.

659
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:47,468
Don’t worry, I didn’t steal this
from the workers.

660
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:49,262
I took it from Sir Louie.

661
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,498
Uncle Roger and I have been
targeting him for a while.

662
01:37:07,173 --> 01:37:08,765
You need this more than I do.

663
01:37:13,309 --> 01:37:17,857
I already got some for myself.
Don’t worry about me.

664
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:22,027
Use this money to fix your life.

665
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:23,640
Wherever I may end up,

666
01:37:24,156 --> 01:37:27,804
I won’t stop worrying
unless I’m certain that you’re okay.

667
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:33,331
I want to be with you.

668
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:38,978
If you come with me,
where will this relationship lead us?

669
01:37:39,003 --> 01:37:40,922
Our lives will always be in danger.

670
01:37:41,872 --> 01:37:44,217
Let me sort out my life first.

671
01:37:44,661 --> 01:37:48,429
Who knows, I might just muster
up the courage to turn myself in.

672
01:38:03,162 --> 01:38:07,115
I already talked to someone in Bicol.
I’ll stay there for a while.

673
01:38:07,158 --> 01:38:09,175
We’ll see each other again.

674
01:38:15,799 --> 01:38:17,375
You need to leave now.

675
01:38:40,449 --> 01:38:44,027
I need to go. You take care.

676
01:39:36,374 --> 01:39:37,875
Drop your weapon!

677
01:39:42,636 --> 01:39:44,638
Diego, it’s time to surrender!

678
01:39:48,225 --> 01:39:53,908
Diego! Stop it!

679
01:40:20,549 --> 01:40:24,219
Stop shooting! Diego!

680
01:43:05,464 --> 01:43:07,674
I’ve finished the script.

681
01:43:07,716 --> 01:43:11,760
I’m done with mine, too.
Submit yours. They might like it.

682
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:15,421
But the concept isn’t mine.
I just wanted to finish it.

683
01:43:15,446 --> 01:43:18,301
So you’re just going to give it
to your producer?

684
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:54,814
How are you?

685
01:44:56,408 --> 01:44:59,235
I'm good. And you?

686
01:45:04,933 --> 01:45:08,911
I’ve finished the script.
But I deleted it.

687
01:45:11,861 --> 01:45:15,072
Why did you delete it?
What a waste.

688
01:45:16,458 --> 01:45:20,381
It wasn’t a waste, because I finished it.

689
01:45:23,101 --> 01:45:27,263
I’m sorry though
that Mr. Dizon backed out.

690
01:45:27,485 --> 01:45:34,937
It’s not your fault. I’m not blaming you.
There are other opportunities out there.

691
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,902
I’m sorry I fucked up.

692
01:45:52,482 --> 01:45:53,873
Friends?

693
01:46:10,565 --> 01:46:11,971
Friends.
