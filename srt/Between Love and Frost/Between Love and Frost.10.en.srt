3
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
You may leave.

4
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,200
Yes.

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,240
Miss Chu,

6
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,600
you dare plant a bomb

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,640
in broad daylight.

8
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,600
You've truly stirred up quite a storm.

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,600
It has caused Mrs. Gu some trouble.

10
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,640
Mr. Chu offered this to apologize.

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,760
Greater recompense

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,680
will follow.

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
But

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,360
such affairs

15
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,120
barely pose grave challenges to me.

16
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,640
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,640
You're free to leave.

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
If you had the nerve to commit murder,

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,160
you ought to have done it

20
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
cleanly and decisively.

21
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,940
Now not only did the victim survive,

22
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,560
but I've lost a fortune.

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,120
And Gu Tongce now has leverage over us.

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
If such things happen again,

25
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,360
don't blame me
for ignoring our paternal bond.

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,880
Go.

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't move!

28
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,920
Turn around.

29
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Put your hands where I can see them.

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,000
You really are relentless.

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,200
You good-for-nothing!

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,240
Didn't you notice
they were tailing you?

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,080
No.

34
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,600

Stop,

Thank you, Doctor.

Okay.

Since Chu Huaixuan was captured,

Father said he misses you,

and tell him you'll kill his father

111
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,920
and see if he will help you.

112
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,320
How about this?

113
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,560
One last chance.

114
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,320
Can't bring yourself to do it?

115
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,560
Drug Gu Tongpei

116

to make him unconscious.

117
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,760
Then exchange him for Gu Rongchong.

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,800
Otherwise,

119
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,960
I'll expose everything.

120
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
Why should I ever trust you again?

121
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,800
You have no choice.

122
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,760
Fine.

123
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
How could you hit her?

124
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,640
Stop! Don't act on impulse!

125
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
Your father is recovering
in the mansion.

126
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Don't rouse him.

127

One day,

128
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,560
you'll act exactly like me.

129
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,320
Don't!

130
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,240
Go.

131
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,400
I'll do it myself.

132
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
Why weren't you fighting back?

133
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
Are you afraid of him?

134
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560
I haven't finished
what I set out to do yet.

135
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,720
I can't afford

Once everything is over,

138
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,960
I'll take you away
