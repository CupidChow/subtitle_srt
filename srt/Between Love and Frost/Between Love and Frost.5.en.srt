[Episode 5]

3
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,560
How is it? Still hurting?

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Huh?

5
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,120
No.

6
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,950
You wrapped it up like a pro.

7
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,120
Don't push yourself. Let me do it.

8
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,360
If I hadn't saved you,

9
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,630
we wouldn't have

10
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,960
got along peacefully.

11
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,150
Why did you save me?

12
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,710
Even if you owe me your life,

13
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,000
no need to risk your life to repay.

14
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,750
Then what should I do?

15
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,710
Marry you?

16
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,360
Just a minor injury.

17
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Not that serious.

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You haven't answered me.

19
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,150
How should I repay it?

20
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Gu Tongpei,

21
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,630
as long as

22
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,150
you stay out of my actions,

23
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,360
I promise I won't hurt you.

24
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,280
We can

25
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,360
get along peacefully.

26
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,470
Deal.

27
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Alright?

28
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,070
Never let anyone know

29
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,160
that I got injured,

30
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,920
or my father will get to the bottom.

31
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay.

32
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,190
I told you

33
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,870
not to act without permission.

34
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,390
Did you tip off Chu Huaixuan?

35
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,160
Yes,

36
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,270
it's me.

37
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,560
I warned you long ago,

38
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,720
but you still go your own way.

39
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,310
You should think clearly.

40
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
Without my help,

41
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,750
it's even hard for you to meet him.

42
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,430
Without my help,

43
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,750
you can't deal with Gu Tongpei, either.

44
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,270
Are you sure you want to go against me?

45
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,510
This is to avenge Si.

46
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,360
If you dare to hurt my men again,

47
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,600
I won't let you go easily.

48
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,720
Everyone is here today.

49
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,800
I heard that at the party yesterday,

50
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,510
you showed off your power

51
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,120
and changed the military suppliers

52
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
on your own initiative.

53
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,920
They cut corners

54
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,750
and should have been replaced long ago.

55
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,430
Confused!

56
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,000
They're our long-time partners.

57
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,920
You should have solved problems
privately if any.

58
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,680
How could you embarrass them in public?

59
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,680
Mr. Gu,

60
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,270
please calm down.

61
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,160
In fact, what happened yesterday

62
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,560
was my plan with Tongpei.

63
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,160
He wanted to use the chance

64
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,310
to warn those suppliers.

65
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,160
He didn't mean
to cancel any cooperation.

66
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,310
Just as she said.

67
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,720
You really have sense,

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,600
but being overly smart isn't good.

69
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Soon you'll be a member of this family.

70
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,190
Always remember

71
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,390
to behave yourself.

72
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,310
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

73
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,750
I see.

74
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
And you.

75
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,070
Remember to behave yourself.

76
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,360
Yes, Father.

77
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,870
Pei,

78
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,200
you're willful, impulsive

79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
and unrepentant.

80
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,870
You're punished
by copying Buddhist scriptures

81
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,320
to learn well how to calm your mind.

82
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,550
You saw it.

83
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,750
Father's word is law to Gu Tongpei.

84
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
Only by working with me

85
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,510
can you avenge as soon as possible.

86
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,320
You plotted against me.

87
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,200
How dare you still bring it up?

88
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,340
What brings you here?

89
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,620
Your were injured.

90
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,140
I don't think you can copy well,

91
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,180
so I came to help.

92
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,300
Never expected that besides fighting,

93
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,740
you have the penmanship for it.

94
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,020
Don't distract me.

95
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,540
I have something serious later.

96
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,540
[Do no evil]

97
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,100
Pei.

98
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,020
What are you doing here?

99
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,020
I want to talk to you.

100
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,940
Please give us a minute.

101
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,940
I don't want outsiders

102
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,380
to hear about the business matters.

103
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,620
You came at the wrong time.

104
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,340
Tongpei was punished to copy this.

105
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,620
If I leave,

106
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,340
he'll be too busy to play with you.

107
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,180
Just get to the point.

108
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,620
My father transferred a batch
of military supplies

109
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,340
and wanted to do business with you.

110
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,900
He said

111
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,020
he wanted to do something for soldiers

112
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,620
who have protected Jiang City.

113
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,620
The money he earned is used
to do good deeds.

114
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,380
He is really kind-hearted.

115
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,780
Warehouse space has been tight lately.

116
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,500
Once he secures a place,

117
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,020
you can go check the goods.

118
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,740
This chance may draw out Chu Huaixuan.

119
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,780
I know an available warehouse.

120
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,940
I'll tell you the address later.

121
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,180
Then just go with Mr. Chu

122
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,340
to check goods.

123
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,300
Thank you.

124
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,940
You've been a huge help.

125
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,340
Is she trying to attack Chu Huaixuan?

126
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,820
All is here.

127
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,580
Thank you so much, Mr. Chu.

128
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,940
Tongpei,

129
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,100
stop being so polite.

130
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,620
It's part of my duty.

131
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,580
Oh no! Fire outside!

132
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,460
Come and put out the fire! Quickly!

133
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,900
Let me check it out.

134
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,780
Pull.

135
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,460
Who are you?

136
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,140
What do you want to do?

137
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,020
Mr. Chu,

138
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,340
I have a question for you.

139
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,180
When the Chu family was wiped out
a decade ago,

140
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,300
besides Mr. Liu, Mr. Sun and you,

141
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,700
who was the last man involved?

142
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,940
What Chu family?

143
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,340
Wiped out? I have no idea.

144
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,420
Any bells ringing?

145
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,980
Who are you from the Chu family?

146
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,700
What's your relationship with them?

147
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,380
Answer

148
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,300
whatever I ask.

149
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,260
Let go of me.

150
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,500
I'll tell you.

151
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,900
I will.

152
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,980
Help.

153
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,220
If you are so loyal,

154
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,780
pay penance

155
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,700
for him.

156
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,300
Hello.

157
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,340
How is the goods handover going?

158
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,180
Haven't you gone out at all today?

159
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,260
Yes.

160
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,740
You look pale.

161
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,820
Are you not feeling well?

162
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,140
Do I? No way.

163
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,220
As expected,

164
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,580
you also went to the warehouse.

165
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,780
This is the evidence.

166
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,700
Since you offered to help,

167
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,700
you've been using me

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,780
to capture Chu Huaixuan!

169
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,340
Yes.

170
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,900
Why did you want to kill him?

171
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,140
None of your business.

172
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,340

173
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,940
