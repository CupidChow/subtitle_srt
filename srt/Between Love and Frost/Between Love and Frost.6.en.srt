00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,020
[Episode 6]

3
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,150
What are you doing?

4
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,390
Come out with me!

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
What were you doing

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,230
with her in the room?

7
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,840
It's a misunderstanding.

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,760
Just for fun!

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,560
For fun?

10
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,760
You'll succeed me as Military Governor
in a few days.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,310
If you stir up any trouble

12
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,150
in the coming days,

13
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,350
you'll ruin yourself. You know?

14
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,280
I told you

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't want to be a Military Governor.

16
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,120
You have no choice!

17
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,200
I took pity on Ce

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,680
and adopted him from the slums.

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,430
He's just a disposable life.

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,590
You are different.

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,400
You're my real son.

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,400
You must embrace your fortune.

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,590
Say whatever you want.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,310
I'll walk my own path.

25
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,200
Walk away if you dare,

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,560
I will kill that woman.

27
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,000
If you kill her,

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,000
upon my accession,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,430
I'll strip Jiang City of its military authority.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
Without this warlord leader,

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,430
the civilian will be happier.

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
Pei!

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,360
You've truly seen me as an outsider.

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,560
I want you to stop Gu Tongpei's

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,470
succession ceremony in the coming days.

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,360
I have news of Chu Huaixuan.

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,590
Go ahead.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,080
He'll escape from the city.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,630
Your two actions before

40
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,870
have alerted him.

41
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,000
You know how cowardly he is.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,680
When will you hand him over to me?

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,000
Kill Gu Tongpei first.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,280
I won't kill him.

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,660
But I have another way

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,820
to destroy the ceremony.

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
My connections can acquire drugs

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,080
to induce prolonged unconsciousness.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,150
Once Gu Rongchong fainted,

50
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,080
the ceremony won't proceed as well.

51
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,710
Right after this,

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
I must see

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
Chu Huaixuan.

54
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,240
Deal.

55
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,120
Flowers!

56
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,080
Flowers!

57
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,340
[Feng's Shop]

58
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,870
Flowers!

59
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,840
Do you want flowers?

60
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,750
Buy one, please.

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,120
No need.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,360
Would you join me for dinner?

63
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,270
Let's have a talk.

64
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,920
Nothing to talk about between us.

65
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,920
I didn't finish my words last night.

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,870
But I made it clear last night.

67
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,950
I have things to attend to.

68
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,830
Please leave.

69
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,070
And if you keep pestering me,

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,830
we'll become enemies.

71
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,920
Chu Minghui,

72
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,920
you just work with Tongce

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,600
to use each other, right?

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,190
Flowers!

75
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,720
Flowers!

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Get some flowers?

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,800
No.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,430
Sir, do you want flowers?

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,630
This...

80
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,560
That's between him and me.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,630
None of your business.

82
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,800
If you don't make it clear today,

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
I'll keep pestering you.

84
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,190
You!

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,190
Flowers!

86
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,630
Miss, do you want to buy one?

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,750
Buy one, please.

88
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,000
Miss.

89
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,630
Okay.

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,920
Keep the change.

91
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,120
Yeah. Thank you.

92
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,430
Nice flowers!

93
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,160
I bought them for her,

94
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,190
yet you wanted to take them away.

95
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,070
You gave it to me,

96
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,190
so I can give it to whoever I want.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,190
I bought them.

98
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,390
You can't just give them to anyone.

99
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,240
Tongpei,

100
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,390
just some flowers.

101
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,800
I'll take care of the bill.

102
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,160
But

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
I hope you'll show some discretion.

104
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,630
Since she is my girlfriend,

105
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,040
it only makes sense
if I give her flowers.

106
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,750
Let go!

107
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,560
As you both think they're pretty,

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,240
let's use them as decorations tomorrow.

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,680
That's settled then.

110
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
Just waiting for tomorrow's succession.

111
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
All is Gu Tongpei's fault.

112
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
Even my mealtime was messed up!

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,830
What do you want here?

114
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,360
Just have a look.

115
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,630
Take your time then.

116
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,190
Hungry?

117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
No.

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,870
Then what are you looking for?

119
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,310
Just have a look.

120
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,950
Want half?

121
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,390
Let's share this.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,310
Actually, I just wanted to help you.

123
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,560
Tomorrow is the succession ceremony.

124
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,390
Pig out now

125
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,600
and your face might puff up.

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,310
I'll take more off your bowl.

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,150
Thanks.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
Finished?

129
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,870
I'm full.

130
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,670
I'll head out now.

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
I can't finish it anyway.

132
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,390
Here, have a little.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,750
I don't want to waste food.

134
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,750
Sorry, Gu Tongpei.

135
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,630
I'm going to break our promise tomorrow.

136
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,750
Thank you!

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,390
Let's keep in touch more.

138
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,600
Pei.

139
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,630
Mr. Gu.

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
Sun, Liu,

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
let me introduce.

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
This is my son, Gu Tongpei.

143
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,670
Please give him your support.

144
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,390
What a distinguished look!

145
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,840
Go ahead and tend to other tasks.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,790
I'll take care of this.

147
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,440
Yes.

148
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,200
Excuse me for now.

149
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,840
Okay.

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Please give Pei

151
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,030
your support from now on.

152
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,320
Well, cheers.

153
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,550
You have skillful hands.

154
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,240
Did I startle you?

155
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,550
Why are you here?

156
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,360
To take a break.

157
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,750
If I drink one of them,

158
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,870
you won't tattle on me, huh?

159
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,200
Drink this.

160
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,270
If you drink too much,

161
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,840
your father will scold you.

162
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,150
Drink and go back.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,960
The ceremony starts soon.

164
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,080
I didn't want to take the title.

165
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,120
But now I've realized

166
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,000
if that title would make you

167
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,200
believe that I can help you,

168
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
then I'll take it.

169
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
You've been at it for a while.

170
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,550
Take a break.

171
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,840
I'll handle this.

172
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,440
Tao.

173
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,600
Mr. Gu.

174
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
Take this glass of wine to Tongpei.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,790
Yes.

176
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,840
Dear guests,

177
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,790
thank you for your presence.

178
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,600
I'd like to propose a toast.

179
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,960
Once he drinks it,

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,270
he'll faint immediately.

181
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
When will I meet Chu Huaixuan?

182
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Rest assured. I won't break my promise.

183
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,750
Why hasn't he fainted yet?

184
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,440
Today, I've gathered you all here

185
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,080
to announce something really important.

186
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,550
Before sharing it,

187
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,600
I propose

188
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
we toast

189
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,360
to my son, Gu Tongpei,

190
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,600
because today

191
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
holds

192
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,150
profound significance for him.

193
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
You switched the wine.

194
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,700
But it ends up at the same point.

195
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,100
Raise your glasses!

196
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,060
Come on, everyone!

197
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,020
Cheers!

198
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,460
Think clearly. This is your only chance.

199
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,780
Please take care of me.

200
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,620
Rest assured.

201
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,700
I'll keep my promise.

202
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,980
You!

203
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,380
Mr. Gu.

204
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,860
Father.

205
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,300
Mr. Gu.

206
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,020
Father.

207
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,740
Father.

208
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,660
He had a stroke!

209
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,300
Father!

210
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,820
Someone.

211
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,580
Go to the hospital!

212
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,380
She hooked up with Tongpei.

213
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:53,900
What a disgrace!

214
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,540
Mr. Gu was so furious and collapsed.

215
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,580
She is nothing but trouble!

216
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,020
Who is she?

217
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,220
She has clung to Tongce.

218
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,620
How dare she try to seduce Tongpei?

219
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,940
Sorry, Gu Tongpei.

220
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,100
This is the only way I can save you.
