00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,430
I heard everything.

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,870
Don't worry.

6
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
Whoever your enemy is,

7
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,950
I'll help you get revenge.

Gu Tongpei would only

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,590
go against you to protect Gu Rongchong.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,400
Only I

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,480
can truly help and protect you.

12
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,280
You're back.

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,910
Mother,

14
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,030
rest assured.

15
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,910
I shall not spare a single devil

16

17
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,840

Mr. Gu, Long voluntarily handed

20
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,430
over the land deeds of the four streets
from Chu Huaixuan

21
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,960
He pleads with you to spare his life.

22
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,710
Tell him to leave Jiangdu

23
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,630
and never come back.

24
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,280
Yes.

25
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,630
Chu Huaixuan has now been imprisoned.

26
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,000
Publicly, this is attributed
to his suspected involvement

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,360
in gang-related smuggling activities.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Excellent.

Now

every enemy of Chu Minghui

31
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,960
shall become mine.

She helps me eliminate all obstacles.

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,360

We make

35
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,870
such a perfect match!

Father! Wake up!

37
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,190
I've brought what you wanted.

Help! Someone!

was your stepfather.

45
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,720
The newspaper once covered the incident

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
where the Chu family
was slaughtered by bandits.

47
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,560
You despise Chu Huaixuan so deeply.

48
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,270
Is it because

49
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,270
he orchestrated all of this?

50
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,830
Now that I know the truth,

51
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
I can help you seek revenge.

but you don't know anything!

But I'm not your enemy.

Gu Tongpei,

56
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,630
you'd better stay away from me.

57
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,040
You land yourself in peril
time and again.

58
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,630
How could I ever abandon you?

59

66

68

to tip off Gu Rongchong?

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,070

Misunderstand what?

99
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,070
Father,

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,160
my reason to be the Military Governor is

101
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,560
to protect those I vow to safeguard.

grow suspicious.

if we betray ourselves
before Gu Rongchong,

124
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,870
we'll all be destroyed!

125

It doesn't matter if I die.

126
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,670

Or don't you

want to take revenge at all?

131
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,080
No, that's not it.

132
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,480
If you truly seek revenge,

133
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,320
you have to be tough.

134

Why hasn't Tongpei come down yet?

137

What are you planning?

138
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,440
Though my father isn't at home,

139
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200

146

you're overthinking this.

147

I was merely worried about your health.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
Otherwise,

149
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
Father may blame me again
for not caring for you.

150
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,320
Don't bother.

151
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,790
As part of the family,

152
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,750
you should show your concern.

153
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,870
You two haven't got married.

154
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,200
Who knows if she will be your wife?

155
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,870
I don't think so.

156
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,550
I'd originally

157
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,000
planned a grand proposal.

158
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,150
But due to these recent chaos,

159
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,790
it's not proper for anything flashy.

160
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,550
Well,

161
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,080
I just did some simple preparation.

162
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,510
Minghui,

163
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,840
would you

164
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,790
tie your destiny with mine?

165
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Will you marry me?

166
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,870
Tongpei,

167
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,840
as our father is absent,

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,480
only you and the servants

169
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,030
may bear witness.

170
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,080
Did Gu Tongce force you into this?

171
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,240
No.

172
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,270
He's the better choice for me.

173
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,750
Impossible! You're deceiving me!

174
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,630
Nothing is impossible.

175
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,720
He knows precisely what I desire,

176
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,320
and spares no effort to assist me.

177
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,550
Thus, I've grown fond of him gradually.

178
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,320
Moving forward, we'll work hard

179
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
hand in hand toward lasting happiness.

180
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,600
You're lying!

181

You're deceiving me!

182
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,750
Why did you lie to me?

183

Have everything prepared at once.

194
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,540
Understood.

195
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,820
Why push for this?

196
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,300
Am I truly not good enough?

197
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
Pei,

198
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,300
you're incredible.

199
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,620
To me, you're absolutely perfect.

200
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
I won't let you be alone.

201
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,780
I'll always stand by your side.
