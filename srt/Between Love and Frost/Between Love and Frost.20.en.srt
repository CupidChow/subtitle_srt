[Episode 20]

3
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,500
So,

4
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,980
aren't you going to shoot me?

5
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,260
Mr. Gu,

6
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,500
we are husband and wife, after all.

7
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,100
Even though the marriage is fake,

8
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,940
you've given me and Hongdou

9
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,180
a place to stay.

10
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,300
You are the pillar
that holds up this home.

11
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,300
Becoming sensible?

12
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,180
Rest assured,

13
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,100
just be good,

14
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,060
and you and Hongdou will live well.

15
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,540
I even prepared a surprise for you.

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,060
Come in.

17
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,420
Chu Huaixuan

18
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,940
is now a trusted aide
who makes money for me.

19
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,940
He's one of us.

20
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,140
Hongdou should be waking from her nap.

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,820
Go check on her.

22
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,780
You must've heard

23
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,740
on the way back.

24
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,740
Tongpei smashed our opium den.

25
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,700
This business can't go on anymore.

26
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,460
Mr. Gu,

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,900
don't worry,

28
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,020
I've arranged everything.

29
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,460
In some time,

30
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,340
a wealthy merchant named Jiu

31
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,660
will be attending a charity banquet.

32
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,700
As long as we build
a connection with him,

33
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,340
we can make up for all the losses

34
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
we suffered before.

35
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,020
Good.

36
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,100
[Palace of Joy]

37
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,980
Chu Huaixuan is still alive.

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,060
You know it too?

39
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,020
Too?

40
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,900
So Chu Yan told you.

41
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,060
Pei,

42
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,460
my father is working for Gu Tongce.

43
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,260
I know you're looking for leverage
against him.

44
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,940
I can help you.

45
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,860
Let's work together

46
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,220
to kill Chu Huaixuan.

47
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,140
Why do you suddenly want
to work with me?

48
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,500
Aren't you afraid

49
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
his close ties with Gu Tongce

50
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,780
will affect Tongce?

51
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,580
Chu Huaixuan is my enemy.

52
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,980
He deserves to die.

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,460
As for Ce...

54
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,140
Chu Huaixuan has everything to do

55
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,380
with the opium.

56
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,580
Eliminating him

57
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,540
will only benefit
my husband's reputation.

58
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,140
In that case,

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,900
what benefit is there for me

60
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,500
if I help you?

61
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,540
If you're unwilling to help,

62
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,700
then forget it.

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,340
I only asked what benefit I can get.

64
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,180
I never said I wouldn't help.

65
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,980
You know it.

66
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,900
I can't refuse your request.

67
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,740
Chu Huaixuan and Ce

68
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260
want to seek help
from a wealthy merchant

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,500
named Jiu.

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,300
Telling me this,

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,260
aren't you worried I'll go and ruin it?

72
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,380
Then let's wait and see.

73
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,180
Pei, are you looking forward
to meeting Jiu?

74
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
What do you plan to do?

75
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,740
He is a mysterious person.

76
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,860
I only managed to trace
a few business dealings,

77
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,460
nothing else.

78
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,140
I'll just have to play it by ear.

79
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,940
That is Jiu.

80
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,260
Jiu, your reputation precedes you.

81
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,900
I am Chu Huaixuan.

82
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,300
Allow me to introduce you

83
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,500
to the famed Military Governor

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,140
of Jiang City.

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,260
Jiu.

86
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,900
This

87
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
is Mrs. Gu, right?

88
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,740
How beautiful and graceful.

89
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,940
Like an old friend.

90
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,540
Jiu appreciates you.

91
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,900
Hurry and offer him a toast.

92
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,020
Apologies,

93
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,660
I'm unwell

94
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
and can't drink alcohol.

95
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,620
Minghui,

96
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,340
with Jiu's kindness,

97
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,140
you should drink some.

98
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,900
No, Mr. Gu,

99
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,300
you don't get it.

100
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,940
I especially adore

101
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,260
this kind of aloof beauty.

102
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,300
Makes me want to cherish her.

103
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,860
Jiu,

104
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,300
we came here
to sincerely discuss cooperation.

105
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,940
Where's the sincerity?

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,060
Mr. Gu, you'd better show me some.

107
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,300
If not,

108
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,300
Mrs. Gu can do it on your behalf.

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,660
Right, right.

110
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,900
Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

111
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,060
Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

112
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,300
Shall I take you down to get changed?

113
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,500
Let go!

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,220
Come on.

115
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,860
You're not even drunk.

116
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,180
Why push your wife out
to entertain people?

117
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,660
Jiu, right?

118
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,900
I'll drink this

119
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,900
on my sister-in-law's behalf.

120
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,580
When men bring women to banquets,

121
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,780
it's so they can serve
a special purpose.

122
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,980
Women serving men is only natural.

123
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,740
Do you still think
you're a businesswoman?

124
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,780
A woman doing business
is nothing but a joke.

125
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,500
Don't be ungrateful.

126
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,260
Who says women can't do business?

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,100
You...

128
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,860
You...

129
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,900
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,980
This isn't your place to speak.

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,260
Jiu, my apologies.

132
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,380
Today's poor arrangements were my fault.

133
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,460
Please accept my apology.

134
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,900
Jiu, good evening.

135
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,900
Sorry.

136
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,300
For my little joke.

137
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,740
Normally I prefer not to show myself.

138
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,780
But Mr. Chu here said

139
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,580
Mr. Gu was sincerely
seeking cooperation.

140
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,740
That's why I came today.

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,980
However,

142
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,900
in business,

143
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,740
character is what counts.

144
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,780
And everyone has seen
what kind of man Mr. Gu is.

145
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,540
No matter how sincere you claim to be,

146
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,100
you're still nothing but rotten cabbage.

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,780
I won't be doing this deal.

148
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,380
You...

149
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,300
Pei, I'll do whatever you say.

150
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,900
Don't think that just because
you paid my medical bills,

151
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,780
I'll be grateful to you.

152
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,660
Look at you now. How pathetic.

153
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,100
How does it feel
to be treated like an object,

154
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,260
toyed with by people?

155
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,580
Nothing much.

156
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,060
I'm used to it.

157
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,540
For a woman to rise to Jiu,

158
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,660
you must have endured plenty.

159
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,700
Don't be hypocritical with me here.

160
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,620
Now,

161
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm the one who suits Pei best.

162
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,900
A bit of suffering is nothing.

163
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,540
But as for you,

164
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,380
if you want to kill Chu Huaixuan,
just do it.

165
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,700
Don't use it as an excuse
to get close to Pei.

166
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Isn't he your father?

167
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,100
Don't you bring that up!

168
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,940
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

169
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,780
Why...

170
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,140
pretend to be weak?

171
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,540
Crash into them to kill them all.

172
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,300
Pei, are you waiting for me?

173
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,340
When you were with Chu Minghui,

174
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,500
what did you say to her?

175
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,980
Nothing.

176
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,460
I only told her

177
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,740
to stay away from you.

178
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,620
Right now,
she'll only bring you trouble.

179
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,460
I'm the one who can truly help you.

180
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,460
She hurt you so badly.

181
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,140
Don't you mind at all?

182
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,580
All I care about is whether she's happy.

183
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,780
Idiot.

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,900
Someone like me now

185
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,660
isn't worth it.

186
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,020
Chu Minghui.

187
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,860
Chu Minghui.

188
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,460
I'm tired.

189
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,700
Whatever it is, leave it for tomorrow.

190
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,980
Gu Tongpei played the hero again today.

191
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,540
You're pleased, aren't you?

192
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
You hate me even more, don't you?

193
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,740
Just how afraid of Gu Tongpei are you

194
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,740
to care about his every move like this?

195
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,260
Afraid of him?

196
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,620
I'll be the one who wins in the end.

197
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,180
I'll make sure

198
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,900
you see me trample Gu Tongpei underfoot.

199
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,180
Mr. Gu Tongce is hosting
a family banquet at the dining hall

200
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,980
for you and Miss Chu Yan.

201
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,620
He's tied up with official duties

202
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,820
and can't get away for now.

203
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,300
Please feel free.

204
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,740
What is it, Hongdou?

205
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,500
Here, give it to me.

206
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,500
Hongdou saw you were injured

207
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,740
and wanted to help put on the ointment.

208
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,020
But she couldn't reach,

209
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
so she asked me to help.

210
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,420
So I helped you with the ointment.

211
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,900
She's little and naive.

212
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,620
Sorry to trouble you.

213
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,580
There's no need to be so polite with me.

214
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,180
It's still improper for you to be here.

215
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,580
Since the ointment's been applied,

216
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
please leave.

217
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,140
No, Mother, I see more wounds.

218
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,860
