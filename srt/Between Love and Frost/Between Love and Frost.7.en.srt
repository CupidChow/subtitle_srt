00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,020
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,430
What?

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
Waiting for Gu Tongce

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,400
to explain to him?

6
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,230
You only care about him,

7
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,760
not my father's safety,

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,840
or how I feel, huh?

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Put me down.

10
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,120
Tell me earlier if you want to use me.

11
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,590
How deeply do you feel for Gu Tongce?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,920
Even at the cost of your fame,

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,760
you ruined my succession ceremony!

14
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,150
So all your kindness

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,710
and tenderness to me

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,920
were a lie, right?

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,640
No.

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,640
But I have things I must do.

19
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,040
To capture Chu Huaixuan,

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,150
you even ruined me.

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,920
From today on,

22
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,400
you're not leaving this mansion.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
From now on,

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,950
I'll always keep an eye on you.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,150
Try forcing your way out?

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,790
Bring it on.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,310
Though we both

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,400
end up battered,

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,840
you still won't escape.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,120
Even if you can,

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,710
you'll be too weak to kill Chu Huaixuan.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,190
About what happened today,

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm very sorry.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,590
If you want to punish me,

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,750
torture me and take your revenge,

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,560
just do what you want.

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,870
But nothing will stop me.

38
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,960
Then go ahead and try.

39
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,360
He's raging right now.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,630
Best not to clash head-on.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
I'll wait and meet Gu Tongce.

42
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,000
We had an agreement.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,910
Where is he?

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,310
You even bring it up?

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,630
You've ruined everything!

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,360
The succession ceremony was interrupted.

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,710
How did you do it?

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,430
As my woman,

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
you kissed Gu Tongpei in public.

50
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,560
Do I mean anything to you?

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,080
So

52
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,150
you refuse to keep your promise?

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
As you broke yours first,

54
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,750
you have no grounds to demand anything.

55
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,240
In this case,

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,710
I'll turn to Gu Tongpei for cooperation.

57
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,840
Unlike you, he won't be so erratic,

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
tearing up deals on a whim.

59
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,150
I can handle Gu Tongpei,

60
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,150
so I can also handle you.

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,240
If we join forces,

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
think hard about it...

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,240
He won't trust you.

64
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,150
He hasn't killed me yet.

65
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,910
Don't you think he trusts me?

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,190
You and I

67
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,190
are not a couple,

68
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,310
but partners.

69
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,720
I don't know why you're pissed off

70
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,800
and why you are mad.

71
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,600
But tonight I must

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
see Chu Huaixuan,

73
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,270
or

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,950
I won't let you go.

75
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,310
Now

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,310
I must not offend her.

77
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,160
Without my permission,

78
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
how dare you wander off?

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,560
Mr. Liu,

80
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,510
what do you want to do?

81
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
She ruined the succession ceremony.

82
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,920
She must harbor ulterior motives.

83
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,560
I need arrest her

84
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
for rigorous interrogation!

85
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,680
Take her away!

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,310
- Yes.
- Yes.

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,160
Without my explicit orders,

88
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,360
who dares lay a finger on her?

89
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,720
Do you act like a Military Governor?

90
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Going to such lengths to defend her.

91
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,830
What will your father think

92
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,830
if he finds out?

93
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,430
This is my family affair.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,310
Stay out of it!

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,950
Today, no one lays a hand on her.

96
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,560
Go.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,920
I...

98
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,190
No more words.

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,070
Minghui.

100
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,510
Your matter is all done.

101
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,750
You may collect him now.

102
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,310
We're paid to kill you.

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Chu.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,660
[Palace of Joy]

105
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,560
So it's you who want to kill me?

106
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,950
Why?

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,750
It has been just a decade,

108
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,600
yet you've forgotten me.

109
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,240
You are...

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,720
What happened?

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,430
He struck a deal with me,

112
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
and paid far more than you did

113
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,550
for your life.

114
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll trade businesses on four streets

115
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,790
for my own life.

116
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Let me go

117
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,150
and kill the one who bought my death.

118
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,750
Who'd turn down easy money?

119
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,320
Fair enough.

120
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Precisely.

121
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,630
No one would turn down easy money.

122
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,510
I'd drag someone down with me.

123
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,320
But if he is dead,

124
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,390
who'll pay you then?

125
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,320
Don't listen to her wild talk!

126
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,790
Take her out!

127
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll pay you just the same.

128
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
Someone reported

129
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,030
gunfire and brawling here!

130
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,630
Take them back to the bureau
for interrogation.

131
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm just doing business

132
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,630
with Mr. Chu.

133
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,360
Long,

134
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,030
we've known each other long enough.

135
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,750
Today, you broke the rules.

136
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
If I simply let you walk away,

137
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,000
tomorrow Jiang City will drown in chaos.

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,630
You'll come with me.

139
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,750
What if I refuse?

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Put down your weapon
if you wish to live.

141
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,200
You people

142
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,630
have no regard for rules these days.

143
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Tongce,

144
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,960
even as the police director,

145
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,390
you can't contain them.

146
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,390
Are you alright?

147
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,750
Tongpei,

148
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,910
leave maintaining the law

149
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
and order to me.

150
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Mr. Chu,

151
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,510
please come with us.

152
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
I need to see the Military Governor.

153
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,670
Come with us for a full investigation

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,150
and then

155
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,150
you'll see him.

156
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,600
Take them all!

157
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,150
Go! Hurry up!

158
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,670
Move!

159
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,750
What's happening?

160
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,510
I've kept tabs on him

161
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,750
and noticed something off.

162
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,750
I raced over here out of worrying you.

163
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
You can rest easy.

164
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,200
Tonight, Chu Huaixuan isn't escaping.

165
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,630
Let's go.

166
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,750
Sorry, no time to explain.

167
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,550
Release me!

168
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,550
Why do you lock me up?

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,750
Let me out!

170
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,630
I demand to see the Military Governor.

171
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
[A mother reaps her own woes.]
I demand to see the Military Governor.

172
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,790
Someone!

173
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,790
Why do you lock me up?

174
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,670
Guards!

175
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,240
Let me out!

176
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,480
You wretched creature!

177
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,320
How I wish I had killed you back then!

178
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,960
I shouldn't have let you survive!

179
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,240
Back then, as my father died young,

180
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,960
you deceived my mother with sweet talk

181
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,320
and married into our family

182
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
only

183
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,120
to betray us.

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,240
You even slaughtered my family
for wealth.

185
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,910
Luckily, I survived precisely for this day

186
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,750
to hunt down a fiend like you!

187
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
You want to kill me?

188
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,320
If so, you would have struck long ago.

189
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,720
With my power now,

190
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,320
dare you even attempt it?

191
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
I spare your life

192
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,630
only to ask you questions.

193
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,100
About those who murdered my family,

194
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,340
besides you, Mr. Liu

195
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,220
and Mr. Sun,

196
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,780
who was the fourth?

197
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,140
You want to know?

198
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,660
In your dreams!

199
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,860
I'll kill you.

200
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,220
Fine by me.

201
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,020
See if you can survive till then.

202
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
I'll talk!

203
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,060
Tell me who it was!

204
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,980
It's...

205
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,340
What is he?

206
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,060
You even protect him like this!

207
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,700
Alright.

208
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,580
I'm asking you one last time!

209
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
The Military Governor Gu Rongchong.

210
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,820
I propose

211
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,260
we toast

212
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,540
to my son, Gu Tongpei.

213
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,780
We can

214
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,780
get along peacefully.
