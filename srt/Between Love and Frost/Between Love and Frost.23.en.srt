[Episode 23]

3
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,920
Sir, reporting.

4
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,560
She doesn't have much time left.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,000
Why is that?

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,310
She's so young.

7
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,120
How could it happen?

8
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Her heart suffered a severe injury

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,430
with multiple complications.

10
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,840
Her body is worn out.

11
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,590
There's no saving now.

[Flowers never fade, the moon shines
eternal, two hearts beat as one]

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,750
Mr. Gu!

14
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,840
Our men keeping watch
on Gu Tongce have news.

[Ministry of Military Affairs]

16
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,120
Are these the military supplies
we intercepted?

17
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,560
Yes. I had men tracking these
for a long time.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,710
Shouldn't be wrong.

19
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,360
I heard that last year
was especially cold,

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,910
and many of the Military Governor's
soldiers froze to death.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,960
I thought it was a natural disaster,

22
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,710
but it was man-made.

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,590
They swapped out military supplies,

24
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,560
passing off shoddy goods as real.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,630
Gu Tongce is audacious beyond measure.

26
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
This

27
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,710
happens with every warlord.

28
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,590
They only care about their own profit.

29
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,150
I wonder how much Gu Tongce

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,590
has skimmed off.

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,120
These warlords sit idle

32
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,400
in high office for years,

33
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,430
forgetting that every name on the roster

34
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,360
is a living life.

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,710
Go investigate.
Make sure it's fully uncovered.

36
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,910
Yes.

37
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,190
This is

38
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,070
the money taken

39
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,950
from the military supplies.

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,920
Well done.

41
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,720
When will that batch of supplies arrive?

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,120
By rights, it should have arrived
two days ago.

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,430
Two days ago?

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Mr. Gu!

45
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,720
Mr. Gu,

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
bad news.

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,430
Our supply convoy was intercepted.

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,510
Did you capture the culprits?

49
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,360
They escaped.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,310
Where are the goods?

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
That shipment can't be exposed.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,630
One truck is missing.

53
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,160
How could you bungle this?

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
How could such a big shipment

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,390
be stolen?

56
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,360
Who dares to rob my goods?

57
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,040
Gu Tongpei.

58
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Go,

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,750
call Madam and Miss down.

60
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,240
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Mr. Gu,

62
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,480
regarding the supplies,

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,560
I'll think of another way.

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,310
Wait.

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,310
No need.

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,040
We've tolerated him long enough.

67
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,560
It's time for an end.

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Hello?

69
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,560
Hello, it's me.

70
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,070
I've seized the military supplies

71
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,560
Gu Tongce used
to substitute with inferior goods.

72
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,390
It won't be long before I dig up

73
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,190
all the evidence of his crimes.

74
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,040
I worry he may harm you.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,190
I'll send people
to fetch you and Hongdou.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,600
Madam,

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Mr. Gu requests you and Miss Hongdou
to come downstairs.

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm busy right now.

79
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Talk later.

80
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,630
Madam.

81
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,680
I heard you.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Just let me change my clothes.

83
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,160
Hongdou,

84
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,750
shall I play a game with you?

85
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,830
Let's go.

86
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,160
Let's play hide-and-seek now.

87
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,190
You hide in here.

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,750
No matter who comes,

89
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,920
don't make a sound

90
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,160
or come out,

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
okay?

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,750
What if Father comes?

93
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,160
But

94
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,160
if it's Uncle,

95
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,310
you can

96
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
suddenly jump out and scare him.

97
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
All right?

98
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,830
Then, the game begins.

99
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,920
Where is Miss Hongdou?

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,000
Isn't she with Tongce?

101
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,390
She's been gone since this morning.

102
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,830
No idea where she went.

103
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,120
If you're that doubtful,

104
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,310
come in and search.

105
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,310
Please, Madam.

107
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,830
Miss Hongdou.

108
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,960
What's going on here?

109
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,360
How dare you scheme
with Gu Tongpei against me?

110
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Cuff her.

111
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,550
Yes.

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,120
Stay still!

113
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Today,

114
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
I'll send you both down.

115
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,750
Where is Hongdou?

116
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,870
Couldn't find her.

117
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,550
Madam said she didn't know
where Miss went.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,390
Lock down the entire mansion.

119
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,960
It's fine if we can't find her now.

120
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Just make sure she doesn't get out.

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,750
Go!

122
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,550
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,510
Tell him to come by himself.

124
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,390
Gu Tongpei, you heard that?

125
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,720
Even if you've got something on me,

126
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,960
as long as Chu Minghui and Hongdou
are in my hands,

127
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,030
you can't do anything.

128
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,960
What have you done to them?

129
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm waiting for you to come to me.

130
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,120
In person.

131
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,320
Gu Tongce!

132
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,790
Calm down, it's a trap.

133
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,320
I have to go even if it is.

134
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,440
If anything happens to her and Hongdou,

135
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll regret it forever.

136
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Then I'm going with you.

137
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,080
Gu Tongce must have other moves planned.

138
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,550
You stay here.

139
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
If anything happens to me too,

140
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,960
you'll be the only one left to save us.

141
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,320
With today's sudden upheaval,

142
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,790
my chances of survival are slim.

143
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
What can I do to escape?

144
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,200
You secretly misappropriated
military supplies?

145
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,550
I did it under Mr. Gu's orders.

146
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,750
It was still just for money.

147
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Too bad,

148
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,790
your time is almost up too.

149
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,030
Gu Tongpei has already seized

150
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,960
the batch of military supplies
you tampered with.

151
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,790
Soon, he'll dig out all the crimes

152
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,960
you've committed over the years.

153
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,200
No matter whether he
or Gu Tongce survives today,

154
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,510
all this will be reported
to those above.

155
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Based on what you know of Gu Tongce,

156
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,630
do you think he'll obediently confess

157
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,600
or

158
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,550
find a scapegoat?

159
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Without me, there'd be no one
to make money for him.

160
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,030
He will keep me safe.

161
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,120
You do think highly of yourself.

162
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,390
What do you think he values in you?

163
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,720
You're just easy for him to manipulate.

164
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,960
Speaking of worth,

165
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,960
Commander Liu, who served
under two Military Governors,

166
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,120
was far more valuable than you.

167
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,390
Do you know how Gu Tongce treated him?

168
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,320
He stabbed him to death

169
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,840
without batting an eye.

170
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,510
Wasn't he said to have been killed
by bandits while drunk

171
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,720
and dumped in the river?

172
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Commander Liu was a military man

173
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
with a high rank.

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,790
When have there been bandits so strong

175
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,150
in Jiang City

176
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,550
that they could overpower
a city commander without resistance?

177
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,030
Unless it was Gu Tongce,
whom he never suspected.

178
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,720
If you don't believe me,

179
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,360
you can ask him yourself.

180
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,750
So you mean,

181
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,550
no matter which of the brothers

182
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,360
wins today,

183
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,750
I won't survive.

184
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,910
Work with me,

185
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,120
and I'll make sure you live.

186
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,750
Get me the hairpin on my head.

187
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,670
Sir!

188
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
We couldn't find Miss Hongdou.

189
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,510
Even if you have to turn
the mansion upside down,

190
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,750
you must find her.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,790
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,030
Keep searching.

193
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,790
I will not let anything happen to you.

194
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
Pei.

195
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
There you are, Tongpei.

196
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,600
I am. Let her go.

197
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,030
What's with the rush?

198
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,960
Once we're finished with our business,

199
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
I will.

200
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,360
Now,

201
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,320
drop your gun and throw it over.

202
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,720
Don't listen to him.

203
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,630
Don't worry about me.

204
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,270
Leave her alone!

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,910
Don't worry about me.

206
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,480
Pei!

207
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Stop playing the tragic lovers here,

208
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,440
as if I'm some unforgivable villain.

209
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,840
Don't forget

210
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,510
my whole life was ruined
by the two of you.

211
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,510
Stay still! If you don't, I'll kill her.

212
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,750
Are you insane, Chu Huaixuan?

213
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
Believe it or not, I'll kill you

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,960
before dealing with them.

215
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,000
Try me.

216
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,720
See if I'll kill her faster,

217
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
or if you kill me first.

218
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,390
Can you really afford her death?

219
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
If she dies,

220
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,120
what leverage will you have
over Gu Tongpei?

221
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,480
How will you get your leverage

222
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,750
back from him?

223
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,390
Chu Huaixuan, calm down.

224
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,150
State your conditions.

225
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,750
Neither of you, nor she,

226
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,550
is trustworthy.

227
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
But one thing is true.

228
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,360
She can guarantee my life.

229
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,270
Gu Tongpei,

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,750
I need you to help me
get out of Jiang City.

231
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,480
Deal.

232
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,390
- No!
- No.

233
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,080
Stay still!

234
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,750
Gu Tongce,

235
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,120
all these years I slaved away for you,

236
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,630
and what did it come to?

237
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,000
In the end,
you still cast me aside like trash.

238
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,390
Talking about sparing my life? Ha!

239
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,030
I'll end up just like Commander Liu,

240
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
dead in vain.

241
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,550
You told him.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,390
I regret not stabbing you.

243
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,750
It really was you.

244
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,340
I don't care how you brothers fight.

245
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,540
As long as I get out of this mansion
and leave Jiang City,

246
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,700
do with her

247
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,140
whatever you like.

248
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,100
Stay back.

249
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,140
Or I'll shoot her dead.

250
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,500
Minghui!

251
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,260
Chase him!

252
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Don't worry about me.

253
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,020
Do what you must.

254
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,300
Go.

255
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,660
Don't die on me.

256
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,740
Why are you here?

257
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,460
Wu Jing worried Pei might be in danger.

258
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,540
I hurried here

259
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,740
when I got his message.

260
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,580
My people will protect you and Hongdou.

261
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,900
Where is Hongdou?

262
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,940
Hongdou...
