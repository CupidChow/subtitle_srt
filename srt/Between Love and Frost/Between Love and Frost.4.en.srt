[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,020
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,560
I could have killed you with that shot.

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
But I didn't.

5
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,720
Consider it as repaying what I owed you.

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,320
Say it straight.

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,920
On a snowy day seven or eight years ago,

8
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
you saved me on the old street
in the north.

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,560
Do you remember?

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,360
Are you okay?

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
Your hands are frostbitten.

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,760
Let me warm them for you.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,360
That way they won't hurt.

14
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,360
My men,

15
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,360
I saved each of them.

16
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,500
I've saved too many lives.

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
As for you,

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't recall.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
You're not a bad person.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,720
I don't know why you want to kill me.

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,600
All I hope is

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,720
that you don't get involved

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,440
in the conflict
between me and Gu Tongce.

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Will you?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
You!

26
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Today,

27
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,360
I must give my partner an explanation.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Go.

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
I need time to consider your words.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,040
Thank you.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,760
Pei.

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,000
Father,

33
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,080
you're back.

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,360
You...

35
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
Ouch!

36
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Did you mess around

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,360
again?

38
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
Father, I can't talk now.

39
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,960
I need to hurry upstairs
and bandage this.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,200
Such a worry.

41
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,120
Father, I'll talk to Tongpei.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
Please don't get angry.

43
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Is this how you take care
of your brother?

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,160
He got injured today.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,520
Tomorrow he might get killed.

46
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,240
Listen carefully.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,920
If Tongpei

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,920
ever gets hurt again,

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
I will hold you accountable.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,840
Understood, Father.

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,080
Chu Minghui,

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,640
why isn't Gu Tongpei dead yet?

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
He was prepared.

54
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,360
I fell into his ambush
while still injured

55
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,920
and barely managed to escape.

56
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,320
Being still injured

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
is no excuse for your failing.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
I've done my utmost for your matter.

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
So when will you

60
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
show a little sincerity?

61
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,000
What,

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,640
you want to test my ability?

63
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,700
[Palace of Joy]

64
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
That's the person you want.

65
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,680
No doubts

66
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,600
about my ability anymore, right?

67
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,560
You haven't finished what I asked.

68
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
You can do nothing about him.

69
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
Don't cause me trouble tonight.

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,680
As long as you command, Mr. Chu,

71
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,200
we'll do as you say.

72
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,440
We'll rely on you

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,760
to lead us to good money.

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,120
We're businessmen.

75
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
We can surely make money together.

76
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Exactly.

77
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
Mr. Chu.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,840
It's been a while.

79
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,920
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

80
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,800
This is Chu Minghui, my girlfriend.

81
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,320
Mr. Gu's girlfriend?

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,360
Quite pretty.

83
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,920
Mr. Chu, I've heard a lot about you.

84
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
You look familiar, Miss Chu.

85
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,760
Perhaps we've met before.

86
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,400
Why are they still alive?

87
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,640
Leave no one alive.

88
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,120
I happen to be running
a small business.

89
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,560
Hopefully, we can work together.

90
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
We'll see.

91
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
What business can a woman even do?

92
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,280
Exactly.

93
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
She's only made it here

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,000
thanks to the Governor's Mansion.

95
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,240
She wants to steal spotlight from men.

96
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,760
She really doesn't know her place.

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,160
Why can't women do business?

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,960
The army's supply chain

99
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,840
has been corrupted.

100
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,840
I'm looking to change suppliers.

101
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,160
I wonder

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,640
if you would be interested.

103
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,740
Of course.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,760
We can discuss the details later.

105
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,600
You are here too.

106
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,780
If I'd known you were here,

107
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,240
I would have brought my lawyer

108
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,400
to finalize the termination issue.

109
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,600
You've been our suppliers for long.

110
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Still make such rookie mistakes?

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
See,

112
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,720
men and women

113
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,320
are not that different.

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,240
What matters is character and ability.

115
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Those welcomed by the Governor's Mansion

116
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,640
are no ordinary people.

117
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,720
My sister-in-law

118
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,560
doesn't bask
in Tongce's or the Mansion's glory.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,560
She deserves it in her own right.

120
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Tongce,

121
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,040
I have matters to discuss with Minghui.

122
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,000
I'd like to introduce her
to some business partners.

123
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,560
Sounds good.

124
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Go ahead.

125
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,000
Seize the chance.

126
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,840
What was Mr. Gu thinking?

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
All this just for a woman?

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,960
Why did you speak up for me?

129
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,760
I've been fed up

130
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
with those old geezers.

131
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
So you didn't do that for me.

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,320
Seems I overthought it.

133
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,560
Stay still.

134
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Keep quiet.

135
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Hand over anything valuable on you.

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,920
Ow!

137
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,960
It hurts.

138
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,240
Sorry,

139
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
I don't have a single penny.

140
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,040
All I've got is this worthless life.

141
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Take it if you want.

142
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,000
You're still that sharp.

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,600
Sorry, beauty.

144
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,560
Excuse us.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Show some respect.

146
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
Don't call her that.

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,960
This is my sister-in-law.

148
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,400
Aren't you on bad terms
with your brother?

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,720
Why...

150
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
Yes, with my brother,

151
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,960
not my sister-in-law.

152
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,720
Don't try guilt by association.

153
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
Come on, let's talk inside.

154
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's go.

155
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,560
Why are you standing there?

156
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,160
You might actually be able to help.

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
The Central Plains have suffered
a severe drought this year.

158
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,920
The people are in misery.

159
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,160
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

160
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,320
Pei, we've raised some donations.

161
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,680
If exchanged for supplies,

162
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
it can keep them going for a while.

163
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
But the problem is,

164
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,120
how can we make sure these supplies

165
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,040
reach the people intact?

166
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,320
True. Corruption infects everything
these times,

167
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,560
let alone such rich supplies.

168
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,780
My old man won't lend military trucks

169
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,780
to let me cross
into another governor's territory.

170
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,420
But without army escorts,

171
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,940
how can we

172
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,540
deliver the supplies intact?

173
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,380
That's right.

174
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,060
Yeah, what should we do?

175
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,940
You're not a bad person.

176
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,020
All I hope is

177
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,260
that you don't get involved

178
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,140
in the conflict
between me and Gu Tongce.

179
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,660
Thank you.

180
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,140
You haven't finished what I asked.

181
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,620
You can do nothing about him.

182
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,220
Yes, with my brother,

183
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,420
not my sister-in-law.

184
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,060
Don't try guilt by association.

185
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,940
I'll let you go for now.

186
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,580
I'll kill Chu Huaixuan tonight
by myself.

187
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Back when I did
the grain and oil business,

188
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,460
I traveled the Central Plains

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,140
and met some contacts.

190
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,580
But as you know,

191
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,780
those connections

192
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,620
always cost money to smooth.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
If you don't mind,

194
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,740
I can introduce them to you.

195
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,940
That makes sense.

196
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,180
These days,

197
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,780
it's good enough if money can solve it.

198
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,860
Thank you, Minghui.

199
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,220
Here, let's toast to Minghui.

200
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,500
- Sure.
- Okay.

201
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,140
- To Minghui.
- To Minghui.

202
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,860
I'll reach out to them now.

203
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,660
Okay.

204
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,660
You've helped us so much.

205
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
When will you join the organization?

206
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,820
Come on.

207
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,860
Come on.

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,140
Madam, I'll go have a look.

209
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,740
Follow me.

210
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,260
People in the car, hands up! Get out!

211
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,940
Mr. Chu,

212
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,340
the Director reminded you
to strengthen security tonight.

213
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,380
Si!

214
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,860
Madam, it's an ambush!

215
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,340
Take Madam away now.

216
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,660
Take Madam away now!

217
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,780
Watch out, Madam!

218
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,140
Madam!

219
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,540
Don't let Si die in vain. Move!

220
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,580
Move!

221
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Split up!

222
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,100
Why did you try to assassinate Chu?

223
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,460
What does that have to do with you?

224
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,300
Why did you save me?

225
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,540
I owed you a life.

226
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,660
Silly.
