[Episode 27]

2
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
I hope Nan Ya and I

3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,680
can walk on the streets
hand in hand openly.

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,920
You know that's impossible.

5
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,790
But I'll work hard to make it happen.

6
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,590
I'll work hard
to make all the good things happen.

[12 Hours Cooperating
With the Investigation]

8
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,080
I saw Xu Yi going after Nan Ya.

9
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,430
Nan Ya killed Xu Yi by accident.

10
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,030
Stop shifting the topic!

11
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,190
Are you having an affair with Zhou Luo?

12
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,750
You're not answering me, huh?

13
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,430
I'll take it as a yes, then.

14
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,750
I'll go and kill Zhou Luo right now!

15
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,280
Even if your feelings
for Nan Ya are one-sided,

16
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,400
then why did you run away

17
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
when you saw Xu Yi going after Nan Ya?

18
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,360
I didn't want to run.

19
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,800
But that was how my body
reacted instinctively.

20
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
Xu Yi!

21
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,310
I'll call the police
if you act recklessly!

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Go ahead. At most,
I'll be detained for a few days.

23
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,030
Xu Yi!

24
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,030
I'll call the police
if you act recklessly!

25
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,870
Go ahead. At most,
I'll be detained for a few days.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,310
What if Xu Yi didn't die?

27
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,400
What if he stood up
and killed Nan Ya?

28
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,240
You rushed toward him
without hesitation

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,430
when Xu Yi abused Nan Ya before.

30
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,560
Why did you run away this time?

31
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,600
Didn't you go back
and check on her after that?

32
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,120
I didn't.

33
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,480
So you didn't care
whether she was alive or not, huh?

34
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,190
Didn't you intend to help her out?

35
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,000
You actually came here
and reported the case to us immediately.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,750
Zhou Luo,

37
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,310
was this how you treated
the person you loved?

38
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,630
What were you doing

39
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,070
for the previous four to five hours

40
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,870
before you reported the case?

41
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm sure you didn't expect

42
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,270
the existence of the cassette tape.

43
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,160
I guess you didn't expect

44
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,750
that the medical examiner discovered
that the wound on Xu Yi's chest

45
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,800
was a complex wound
with signs of pulling in and out, huh?

46
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,270
Do you think

47
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,680
Nan Ya can be more powerful than a man?

48
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I don't know.

49
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,480
I don't know.

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,270
Zhou Luo,

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,390
I'll give you another chance.

When will you confess to him?

That's none of your business.

This isn't a big deal, you know?

Listen,

105
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,120
it's very easy for a girl
to court a guy.

106

Just lean toward Zhou Luo

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,270
when you confess to him,

108
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,510
and he'll fall for you immediately.

109
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,120
What kind of stupid idea is that?

110
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
Just shut up.

111
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,910

Listen,

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,750
Zhou Luo has an eccentric temper.

114
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,910
And Qingli is a prideful girl.

115
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,720
If he doesn't accept her confession,

116
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,510
the four of us won't be able
to hang out again.

117

There's no way we can get along
after that, you know?

118
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,270
I can't stand you.

119
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,240
Qingli.

120
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,910
Listen,

121
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,120
when the time comes,

122
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,630
just hold his hand.

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
Trust me.

124
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Holding hands

125
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,870
is a safe bet.

126
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,670
If he shows no interest,

127
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,870
you can say that it's
a gesture of friendship.

128
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,390
Just say that you can't help it
as it's already the millennium.

129
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,510
Let me think about it.

130
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,030
You've thought about it
for already too long.

131
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,440
I can't stand you.

132
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,910
Yes!

133
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,720
"Yes" for what? I'll play with you.

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,030
How is it?

137
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,750
He got it.

138
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,120
Show it to your father.

139
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,600
Let me have a look.

140
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
This is the admission notice
from Jinghua.

141
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,360
Yeah.

142
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,320
That's not the admission notice.

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
It's just an admission notice
with a reduced score.

144
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,080
Even so,

145
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
it's still a notice.

146
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah.

147
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,150
They're reducing
the required scores by 50.

148
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,670
He can definitely pass the exam
no matter what.

149
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,150
You're exaggerating it.

150
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,120
Guixiang, congratulations.

151
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,320
I heard that Zhou Luo got into Jinghua.

152
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,510
Congratulations.

153
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,000
Thanks for the wishes.

154
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,000
Look.

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,870
This is an admission notice
with a reduced score from Jinghua.

156
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,670
Jinghua University?

157
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,910
It's already a sure thing
that he will go to Jinghua.

158
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,840
They will reduce by 50 points.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,360
That's a lot.

160
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,390
Why don't they just recommend him
for admission to school?

161
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,360
Yeah. Isn't that better?

162
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,320
No need for that.
My son doesn't need that.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,550
He can get into it
with his own abilities.

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,720
It's the New Year.

165
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,510
Look at everyone.

166
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,910
They're all reunited.

167
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,120
Look at us.

168
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,630
I don't even know where your father is.

169
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,240
I can't rely on him at all.

170
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,360
Hold this.

171
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,030
You want to compare with him?

172
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,750
You'd have a clear understanding
of your own abilities.

173
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Your father left nothing behind for you
except a bad reputation.

174
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,630
Luo was only less than 20 points away
from the required grade.

175
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,320
That means more than 30 points
they allocated will go to waste.

176
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,270
Chen Jun, come here!

177

- Zhou Luo is back!
- He's back?

178
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,360
Hurry!

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm happy!

180
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,550
Zhou Luo!

181
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,000
How could you not tell us
that you were coming back?

182
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,870
Auntie Guixiang, Happy New Year.

183
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,120
Happy New Year.

184
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,630
Mr. Zhou, Happy Millennium Night!

185
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,960
You too.

186
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,270
Chen Jun, you guys have to be careful.

187
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,000
Zhou Luo will be fine with us!
Don't worry!

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,870
Come up here and play with us!

189
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,600
Hurry!

190
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,390
Keep this in your bag.
Don't lose it, okay?

191
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,720
I won't. Don't worry.

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,960
My son is the best.

193
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,120
I'll go and join them now.

194
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,790
I'm so happy.

195
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,440
Guixiang.

196
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,390
Where are you going?

197
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,910
Seems like your daughter
has a thing for Zhou Luo.

198
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,720
My daughter has an excellent taste.

199
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,790
In the future, both of them
will get into a university in Beijing.

200
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,510
They'll have
a bright future ahead of them.

201
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,200
This time,

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,030
your wishful thinking
actually came true.

203
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,480
Hear yourself.

204
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,000
You're making it as if I'm trying
to profit from my speculation.

205
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,790
Xu Yi even said that he wanted to invest

206
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,750
in our cram school before.

207
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,150
The bridge has collapsed.

208
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,630
Xu Yi doesn't have that kind of money.

209
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,550
A thin camel is bigger than a horse.

210
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,870
If so, you have to look after Zhou Luo.

211
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,390
You have to make sure
he gets into a university.

212
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,360
Of course.

213
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
Zhou Luo,

214
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,030
because of your expertise

215
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,750
and innovative potential
in the field of physics...

216
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,550
This is embarrassing.

217
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,720
Based on our
independent enrollment assessment,

218
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,630
your admission score
for the same subject category

219
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,030
will be reduced by 50 points!

220
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,320
That's amazing!

221
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,840
Zhou Luo, you're brilliant!

222
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,790
You're so amazing.

223
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,720
That's enough.
Are we playing pool or not?

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,120
Bring it on.

225
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
Come on.

226
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,000
As usual,

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,240
you two will be on one team
while we'll be on one team.

228
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,670
Zhou Luo,

229
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,870
the loser will

230
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,270
treat the winner to a meal.

231
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,550
Did you see that?

232
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,000
It's that stall.

233
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,270
Did you see that?

234
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,360
12 yuan for one set.

235
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,240
You can choose five dishes.

236
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,790
Alright.

237
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,360
Okay?

238
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Whoever breaks his promise
is a rascal.

239
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,720
Auntie Guixiang!

240
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,270
Wanwan!

241
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
You look so pretty today.

242
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,320
Did your mother buy you a new outfit?

243
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,670
No.

244
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,750
Mommy made it for me.

245
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Your mother is so good
at making outfits.

246
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,200
Where's your mother?

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,510
Mommy is over there.

248
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,510
You can't do anything about it
when I don't have the money.

249
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm not selling it.

250
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,000
If so, you can wait
for the court's verdict, then.

251
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,240
I...

252
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,630
Wanwan, sit here, okay?

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,270
I'll get you some fruit juice, okay?

254
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,120
Okay.

255
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,670
Good girl.

256
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Birdie, don't be scared.

257
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,150
You vixen! You jinx!

258
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,480
You unwanted wretch!

259
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,750
You just want to steal my house from me!

260
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,080
Listen up! I'll make sure you suffer

261
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,320
even if I have to hire goons!

262
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,510
Why did you offend her
on such a good day?

263
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,510
She has such a filthy mouth.

264
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,030
Just avoid her in the future.

265
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,550
Happy New Year, Guixiang.

266
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,200
Happy New Year.

267
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,030
Oh, right.
You should keep Wanwan company.

268
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,080
Did Auntie Guixiang
give this fruit juice to you?

269
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,150
Did you thank Auntie Guixiang?

270
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,790
Thank you, Auntie Guixiang.

271
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't mention it.

272
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,670
I have something to tell you.

273
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Guixiang,
please look after Wanwan for me.

274
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,080
Don't worry. I'll look after her.

275
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
Why are the two of them
interacting with each other?

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,510
Who?

277
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,600
Chen Ling and Nan Ya.

278
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,790
Chen Ling and Nan Ya?

279
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,270
It's already the millennium.

280
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,360
Anything could happen.

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,000
They two can even make peace
with each other.

282
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,360
Chen Jun.

283
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,240
Chen Jun, come here.

284
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,600
Isn't that your sister?

285
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,030
What is your sister doing
with Nan Ya?

286
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,000
Where?

287
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
Over there. On the bridge.

288
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,240
Are you sure it's my sister and Nan Ya?

289
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,150
What are the two of them doing
on Millennium Night?

290
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,150
Nothing will go wrong, right?

291
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,120
Hope so.

292
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,150
Chen Jun.

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,630
I need to go downstairs.
I'll be back in a second.

294
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,550
Xu Yi signed the paper.

295
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,550
Thank you, Chen Ling.

296
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
You don't need to thank me.

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
I didn't do it for you.

298
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,840
I did it for myself.

299
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,480
Our grudges have been resolved.

300
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,670
At least,

301
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,480
we can be strangers
without any hostility.

302
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,150
I don't want to carry my hatred of you
into the next century.

303
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,630
I would rather you hate me.

304
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,080
You're the only one I'm sorry for

305
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,120
in this world.

306
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,270
I don't ask for your forgiveness,

307
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,120
because forgiveness means nothing.

308
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,240
I would rather I owe you.

309
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,790
You're not worthy.

310
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,600
No matter if it's the next century

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,510
or in our next lives,

312
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,870
maybe

313
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,960
it will be all fair to us.

314
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,150
I'm even willing to repay you tenfold

315
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
or a hundredfold.

316
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,000
Chen Ling,

317
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,960
it's a new year.

318
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,480

Mr. Xu!

364
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,720
You're always busy.

365
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,110
Are you here for the countdown as well?

366
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,440
Listen,

367
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,720
I've spent a lot of effort

368
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,400
to treat Wanwan
and for her to maintain her health,

369
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,440
you know?

370
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
Buddy,

371
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,240
I have something to discuss with you.

372
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,960
I need to attend a meeting
in the provincial capital next month.

373
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,960
Can you lend me your car?

374
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,110
Wish you be as energetic
as a dragon and a horse.

375
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,440
- Better crops, and less disease.
- Better crops, and less disease.

376
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,590
Wish you an auspicious beginning
of the new year.

377
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,510
Dr. Jiang,

378
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,680
I think

379
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,000
you may treat him like your friend,

380
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
but he treats you like his rival.

381
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,440
Newly rich people like them
are uneducated.

382
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,310
He always shows off
by driving around the place.

383
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,960
He hasn't cleaned up the mess
he created during the bridge case yet.

384
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,270
He'll be arrested eventually.

385
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,160
Is that so?

386
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,240
- May we have a bountiful harvest!
- May we have a bountiful harvest!

387
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,790

390
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,830
Mr. Xu, Happy New Year.

391
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,400
The lanterns are pretty nice this year.

392
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,790
I think the investment deal
we talked about before

393
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,590
was excellent.

394
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,270
Shall we talk about it
from a more practical perspective?

395
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,240
See?

396
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,200
I told you, right?

397
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
He ran out of money.

398
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,550
You're the only one who trusts him.

399
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,480
Xu Yi is a jerk.

400
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,880
He doesn't keep his promise.

401
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,590
You're the silly one for trusting him.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
Ling!

403
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Seems like you've put on some makeup.

404
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,200
I told you already.

405
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,440
Women look better with makeup on.

406
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,240
Ling,

407
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,510
I have something to discuss with you.

408
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,350
Tonight's Millennium Night.

409
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
We shouldn't let it go to waste.

410
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,550
Come to my house.
I'll prepare some dishes.

411
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,480
Let's do something romantic, okay?

412
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,030
Get your filthy hands off me!

413
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,720
Don't be shameless.
You should be self-aware.

414
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,510
Understood?

415
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,460
Don't think that you can
take advantage of anyone

416
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,200
just because you're a doctor.

417
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,000
I ignored you when I was in the hospital

418
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,830
because you were
the head of the department.

419
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,510
You should take a look in the mirror.

420
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,550
Do you think you're a popular girl?

421
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,590
Do you know how old you are?

422
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,640
No one will fall for you.

423
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Good. Since we don't like each other,

424
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,720
stay away from me in the future.

425
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,590
No wonder Xu Yi dumped you.

426
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,720
When it comes
to one's temper and personality,

427
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,030
Nan Ya is 100 times better than you.

428
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,830
Forget it.

429
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,270
You should stay happy
since it's New Year.

430
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,160
He's the shameless one here.

431
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
Why should I let him get his way?

432
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,720
May you have peace
throughout the year.

433
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,060
[Guixiang's Video Store]

434
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,200
Nope.

435
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,790
Here, it's your turn.

436
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,270
Zhou Luo, play the big one.

437
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,070
Come on.

438
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,830
My case is almost closed.

439
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,830
Nan Ya,

440
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,350
if all of this didn't happen,

441
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,000
would you be willing
to start anew with me?

442
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
Can you give it to me now?

443
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,030
What?

444
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,920
The divorce agreement.

445
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,830
You're bringing this up
when it's the New Year?

446
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,200
Are you in a hurry to get a divorce?

447
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,550
I only want Wanwan.

448
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,070
Even if we were to be separated,

449
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,350
we would bid farewell
to each other.

450
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,550
Xu Yi,

451
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,400
let us off.

452
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,400
The old has given way to the new.

453
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,960
We should settle our debts.

454
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,350
I remember that you used
to love English songs.

455
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,310
Do they sell them here?

456
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,920
I'll buy some for you.

457
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,400
Xu Yi.

458
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,510
I heard you.

459
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,920
You want a divorce.

460
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,480
Why the rush?

461
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Do you want us to be entangled
in this messy relationship

462
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,920
until the next century?

463
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,350
Nan Ya, you didn't change at all
after all these years.

464
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,030
Nothing will be done
by being impatient, you know?

465
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680
Wanwan.

466
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
Wanwan, come.

467
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,480
Come to me.

468
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,480
I'll show you
the dragon lantern. Let's go.

469
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,550
- The dragon brings prosperity!
- The dragon brings prosperity!

470
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,030
Wish you good luck
in the Year of the Dragon!

472
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,550
Wish you be as energetic
as a dragon and a horse.

473
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,750
Are you okay?

474
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,880
Have a seat.

475
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,420
Her father is taking her
to see the dragon lantern.

476
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,860
It's the New Year.

477
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,220
You guys shouldn't argue.

478
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,100
You shouldn't

479
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,380
take things too seriously.

480
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,060
Just take a step back, and it'll pass.

481
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,020
Listen to me, okay?

482
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,260
The millennium is coming.

483
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,260
Everything will get better.

484
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,020
It will get better.

485
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,380
It'll definitely get better.

486
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,300
Have some sunflower seeds.

487
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,980
They are delicious.

493
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,660
Wanwan.

494
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,980
You're afraid of me, right?

495
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,460
It's my fault.

496
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,380
Don't blame me for this,

497
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,220
okay?

498
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,300
Wanwan,

499
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,780
you must keep this picture.

500
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,420
You must remember
what your father looks like

501
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,020
when you grow up.

You must remember me.

506
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,460
May you have peace
throughout the year.

507
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,900
- May we have a bountiful harvest!

Alright now.

510
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,780
Ride on me
and see the dragon lantern, okay?

511
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,740
Okay.

512
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:53,780
Come.

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,420
Let's see the dragon lantern.

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,940
Wish you be as energetic
as a dragon and a horse.

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,540
- Better crops, and less disease.

00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,820
Wish you an auspicious beginning
of the new year.

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,180
May you have peace
throughout the year.

- The domestic animals are all thriving.

525
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,540
Wanwan.

526
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,580
What? Are you running
out of money again?

527
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,500
I think something's off with Nan Ya.

528
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,100
I'm sure she's short on cash lately.

529
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,940
You better be wary of her.

530
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,540
She wants to sell my house.

531
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,140
She even said she hired a lawyer.

532
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,540
Maybe it's because she needs money
to subsidize another man.

533
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,500
She even said
that she wanted to divorce you.

534
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,740
She's been saying that all the time.

535
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,340
This time, she's kept it well hidden.

536
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,980
Don't you see
she's been pretty happy lately?

537
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,740
She's already 30,

538
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,420
but she looks gorgeous.

539
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,140
Her face is shining with joy.

540
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,700
Clearly, she is seeing someone else.

541
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,380
Many people say
that she's having an affair.

542
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,980
How could you not tell at all?

543
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,780
These pictures are pretty nice.

544
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,980
Who took them for you?

545
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,380
A stranger on the street.

546
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,420
Nan Ya came to see me this afternoon.

547
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,340
She'll only take Wanwan with her

548
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,380
as long as you're willing
to agree to the divorce.

549
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,300
- The dragons soar while tigers leap!
- The dragons soar while tigers leap!

550
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,660
- Better crops, and less disease.
- Better crops, and less disease.

551
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,060
Wish you an auspicious beginning
of the new year.

552
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,580
May you have peace
throughout the year.

553
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,900
- May we have a bountiful harvest!
- May we have a bountiful harvest!

554
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,540
- The domestic animals are all thriving.
- The domestic animals are all thriving.

555
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,260
- The stars shine brightly!
- The stars shine brightly!

556
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,900
Xiu, what happened?

557
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,060
I've been practicing Western medicine.

558
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,380
It's entirely different
from traditional Chinese medicine.

559
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,820
You're getting them mixed up.

560
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,060
Where are the pictures?

561
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,660
What are you doing?

562
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,020
Even if there's something,
don't do this in front of the child.

563
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,540
Wanwan!

564
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,420
Come here!

565
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,100
Let's go.

566
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,820
I've only been here for two minutes.

567
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,700
Only two minutes.

568
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,340
I'm asking you right now.

569
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,900
Where are the pictures you took
at the hilltop?

570
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,460
What do you want to do with them?

571
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,140
Did you hide it away?

572
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,420
Why would I do that?

573
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,500
You're still pretending, huh?

574
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,940
You're selling the house in a hurry.

575
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,620
You want to get a divorce
with me in a hurry too.

576
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,180
You must have had an affair.

577
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,420
I've brought up divorce many times.

578
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,980
But you just didn't want
to sign the paper.

579
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,700
I've already submitted the complaint
to the court.

580
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,020
Even if you don't sign it,
the court will grant me the divorce.

581
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,060
I no longer want to argue with you.

582
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,020
You don't want
to give me the pictures, huh?

583
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,740
I'll head back and find it myself.

584
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,860
If I do find it,

585
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,820
I'll kill him tonight!

586
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,020
Zhou Luo?

587
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,060
Mommy!

588
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,780
Wanwan!

589
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,140
Mommy!

590
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,580
Wanwan!

591
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,620
Wanwan, don't go.

592
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,660
Wanwan, don't cry.

593
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,500
Wanwan.

594
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,580
Mommy!

595
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,500
Wanwan, don't cry.

596
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,420
Mommy is abandoning me!

597
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,900
Wanwan, don't cry.

598
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,660
Wanwan.

599
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,180
Luo!

600
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,300
Don't cry.

601
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,540
They got into another fight.

602
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,580
This is fun, right?

603
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,060
Look, it's flickering.

604
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:12,940
Guixiang.

605
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,180
Guixiang, we need some snacks.

606
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,620
Coming!

607
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,780
Here you go.

608
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,180
Coming!

609
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,140
Where's Zhou Luo's bag?

610
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,300
Didn't he take it with him?

611
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,100
The notice is inside his bag.

612
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,060
Liu Xun!

613
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,700
What are you doing?

614
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,620
Stop right there!

615
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,420
Get out of the way!

616
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,420
Follow me!

617
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,500
You two, hurry up!

618
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,300
Chen Jun!

619
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,100
Stop right there!

620
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,700
Stop right there!

621
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,780
You animal!

622
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,420
Give it to me!

623
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Give me the bag!

624
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,180
Don't come near me!

625
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,020
What are you doing?

626
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,060
I'll burn it if you come near me!

627
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,700
If you burn it, I'll kill you!

628
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,140
Put it down!

629
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,980
How dare you steal his admission notice?

630
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,340
Chen Jun!

631
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,780
Chen Jun, stop hitting him!

632
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,820
Chen Jun, stop hitting him!

633
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,980
Get up!

634
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,460
Get out of the way!

635
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,220
Get out of the way!

636
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
I'll go get my dad!

637
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,620
Chen Jun!

638
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,580
Chen Jun, stop hitting him!

639
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,500
Stop it!

640
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,220
Stop!

641
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,860
I said, stop it!

642
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,940
Stop fighting!

643
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,820
Drag him away!

644
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,180
Let go of me!

645
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,220
I'll kick you to death!

646
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,620
Liu Xun!

647
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,260
Hurry! Get up!

648
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,980
Stop immediately!

649
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,900
If you keep this up,
you will not be allowed to go to school.

650
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,020
I'll kick both of you out of school!

651
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,620
Everyone in the town is celebrating
the New Year by the riverside.

652
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,500
What's the grudge between you two?

653
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,100
You guys are grown-ups now.

654
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,500
I can call the police

655
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,820
and send you guys
to the police station for this.

656
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,740
You guys will have a criminal record.
Then you will feel proud of it, right?

657
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,620
He was trying to burn
my buddy's admission notice.

658
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,740
You are eager to excel.

659
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,140
Then you can compete with him
in the exam.

660
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,540
Do you think you can
attend the university

661
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,820
by burning his admission notice?

662
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,300
If you're capable,
just get a higher score on the exam.

663
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,140
That's none of your business!

664
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,420
He did well in the exam

665
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,540
not because of you!

666
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,420
You're biased toward him

667
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,020
because you want him
to marry your daughter!

668
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,940
Let go!

669
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,140
All these kids,

670
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,660
I wonder what they're thinking.

671
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,660
Their mind is full of nonsense!

672
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,660
Let's go.

673
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,580
What do you want?

674
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,300
This isn't for sale.

675
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,900
Where are the pictures?

676
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,660
Wanwan spilled the pigments everywhere
when she was drawing.

677
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,060
I threw all of the pictures away.

678
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,180
You're lying!

679
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,980
Where is the film?

680
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,780
Although the pictures are gone,

681
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,900
the film should still be around!

682
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,060
You're still lying, huh?

683
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,500
Don't think that I have no idea.

684
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,580
Was Zhou Luo the one

685
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,900
who went on the autumn trip with you?

686
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,300
Mind your belongings.

687
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,940
I saw everything.

688
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,660
We were on the same bus today.

689
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,860
The pictures in his bag

690
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,540
were the same as yours.

691
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,220
There's a dot
in the upper right corner, am I right?

692
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:02,900
Thank you.

693
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,260
So, you like to take pictures?

694
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
These are just random shots.

695
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,020
Come to me if you have any issues.

696
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,540
Don't involve innocent people in this!

697
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,980
You're still defending him?

698
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,020
No wonder he stood up for you.

699
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,260
Did you two sleep together

700
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,100
long ago?

701
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,700
Why don't we go to hell together?

702
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,220
If you kill me, you'll go to jail.

703
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,580
If you fail,

704
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,660
I'll call the police on you.

705
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,020
How dare you threaten me?

706
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,220
Everything you used and ate
was provided by me!

707
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,780
You think you can elope with him

708
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,460
after getting me killed?

709
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,580
Look how I am now.

710
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,260
Why would anyone else want me?

711
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,740
Do you believe
that I'll kill you right now?

712
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,060
It's either I die,

713
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,100
or I divorce you today.

714
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,260
You want a divorce?

715
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,460
In your dreams.

716
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,740
Even if I'm going to hell,

717
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,980
I'm taking you with me.

718
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,700
Xu Yi!

719
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,420
Xu Yi! Come down!

720
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,060
Xu Yi!

721
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,460
I'll kill your little lover tonight

722
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,020
if you dare to make a sound.

723
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,620
Xu Yi!

724
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,780
Come out!

725
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,900
You said you would divorce her!

726
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,660
Nan Ya!

727
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:04,620
Nan Ya, come down!

728
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,660
Get out of here. Just scram!

729
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,260
Chen Ling loves you so much.

730
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,220
Why won't you let me go?

731
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,980
Don't change the subject.

732
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,940
Are you having an affair with Zhou Luo?

733
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,180
You're not answering, are you?

734
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,860
I'll take it as a yes, then.

735
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,860
I'll go and kill Zhou Luo right now!

736
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,060
Xu Yi,

737
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,140
I'll call the police
if you act recklessly!

738
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,820
Go ahead.

739
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,500
Even so, I might been detained
for a few days at most.

740
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,660
Listen, I'll kill him right now!

741
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Then I'll tell the police
you killed Hu Lifan.

742
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,300
What?

743
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,620
Whom did I kill?

744
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,860
I'll kill you tonight.

745
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,420
You wanted to run away, uh?

746
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,180
Nan Ya, you owed me a life.

747
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,460
The one who had killed Hu Lifan

748
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,780
should have been you, not me.

749
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,180
I've done everything for you,

750
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,740
but you want to kill me?

751
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,380
Then I'll kill you first.

752
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,980
I'll kill you!

753
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,820
I'll kill you!

754
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,780
I'll kill you.

755
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,860
Wanwan, come.

756
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Wanwan, come.

757
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,340
Let me carry you.

758
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,860
Let me carry you.

759
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,180
Good girl.

760
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,620
Bingbing.

761
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,420
Stop following me.

762
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,860
You're just addicted to fighting.

763
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,980
Can you not be angry at me
on Millennium Night?

764
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,780
You actually know
that it's Millennium Night, huh?

765
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,500
It's such a good day, you know?

766
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,940
Why did you have to fight with him?

767
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,580
But he stole
my buddy's admission notice!

768
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,460
If so, you could have just
gotten it back!

769
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,060
I disliked him long ago.

770
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,740
I had to teach him a lesson,

771
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,860
instead of allowing him
to celebrate the New Year happily.

772
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,620
Fine.

773
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,820
Now, you don't need
to celebrate the New Year either.

774
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,140
Why can't I?

775
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,020
This occasion only occurs
once every thousand years.

776
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,900
Didn't we agree to make a wish together?

777
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,980
You can make it yourself.

778
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,100
I won't join you.

779
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,180
Bingbing.

780
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,940
The fireworks performance
will begin soon.

781
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Where's Zhou Luo?

782
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,500
Come on, let's go to his family's stall.

783
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,260
Okay.

784
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,980
Everything.

785
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,380
I'll give you everything I have,

786
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:04,940
okay?

787
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:05,740
Okay.

788
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,460
Look at this.

789
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,060
Mom.

790
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,220
I want to go home.

791
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,380
What's wrong?

792
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,220
I have a stomachache.
I need to use the restroom.

793
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:15,980
Are you okay?

794
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,060
I'm fine.

795
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,100
Go now.

796
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,060
He has a stomachache.

797
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,420
Wanwan, do you have a stomachache?

798
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,460
Auntie Guixiang, where did Zhou Luo go?

799
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,340
He said he wanted to go home
because he had a stomachache.

800
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,940
What's wrong with your face?

801
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,780
It's nothing.

802
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,660
Did you get into another fight?

803
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,020
Liu Xun tried
to play a dirty trick on Zhou Luo.

804
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,140
What?

805
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,500
The countdown will begin
in less than 20 minutes.

806
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,620
Go and check on him.

807
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,740
Hurry.

808
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,060
Zhou Luo!

809
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,140
Zhou Luo?

810
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,180
Zhou Luo?

811
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,540
When I stab him in the neck,

812
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,500
his blood will spurt out.

813
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,780
He'll look at me,

814
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,180
and wait to die.

815
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,580
No one can save him
even if the ambulance comes.

816
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,660
When the ambulance comes,
he is already dead.

817
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,460
You know?

818
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,900
And you...

819
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,420
What are you gonna do?

820
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,660
You can just lie here

821
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,660
and wonder

822
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,460
if Zhou Luo is dead or not,

823
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,300
if Zhou Luo is okay,

824
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,660
or if he is killed or not?

825
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,540
And then,

826
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,180
I'm going to go to hell with you.

827
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,100
I'm going to cut you down.

828
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,780
This is good.

829
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,140
This is good.

830
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,980
Zhou Luo, wait for me.

831
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,820
This is good.

832
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,980
Wait for me.

833
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,660
You want to kill me?

834
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,180
Come on!

835
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,740
Come and kill me!

836
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,540
Come on!

837
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,100
I'm an outlaw now.

838
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,380
The police have already suspected me.

839
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,180
Sooner or later,
they'll find out everything.

840
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,380
How long can I live?

841
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,180
I won't go to jail. I won't.

842
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,700
I won't let them take me
to the execution ground,

843
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,980
and shoot me.

844
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,660
I'll let you know
the feeling of killing a man.

845
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,740
Like me.

846
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,140
Xu Yi, let go of me.

847
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,620
You'll live the rest of your life
with blood on your hands.

848
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,020
Let's see if any man wants you.

849
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,500
Come on!

850
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,540
Come on!

851
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,300
Poke it in here.

852
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,740
Deeper. Deeper.

853
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,260
Come on!

854
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:01,780
Let go of me!

855
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,540
Let me go!

856
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:02,700
Come on!

857
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,940
Come on.

858
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,100
See you in hell.

859
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,740
Xu Yi!

860
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,020
I killed him.

861
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,740
Go! Go! Go! Let's watch the fireworks!

862
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,260
Let's go!

863
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,740
Mr. Zhang, Mrs. Zhang,

864
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,460
Let's go to watch the fireworks.

865
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,180
Let's watch the fireworks.

866
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,460
What's wrong?

867
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,500
No, I have to go and check him out.

868
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,900
You're not going to watch the fireworks?

869
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,420
I'm worried about Liu Xun.

870
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,060
Why are you pretending at this moment?

871
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,620
You're really good at pretending.

872
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,820
Are you happy?

873
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,100
No, I'm not.

874
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,460
Then let's make a wish.

875
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,540
I'm not going to make a wish with you.

876
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,660
I wish I could walk down the street
with Nan Ya openly,

877
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,660
hand in hand.

878
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,580
You know, that's impossible.

879
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,340
But I'll try to make it happen.

880
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,060
I'll try to make
all the good things happen.
