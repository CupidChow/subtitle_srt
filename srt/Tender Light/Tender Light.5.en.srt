00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,970
[Episode 05]

2
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,180
There are both witness testimony
and physical evidence.

3
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,900
Why hasn't Nan Ya's case
been settled yet?

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,140
Is it because you fear
the chain social repercussions

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,100
of her killing her husband?

6
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,980
Nan Ya was under Xu Yi's control.

7
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,300
She couldn't divorce him.

8
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,980
Xu Yi got rid
of all the domestic violence evidence.

9
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,140
Even when he was in detention once,

10
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,740
the main victim was Zhou Luo.

11
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,300
Whether they get divorced

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,500
is unrelated to the killing.

13
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,460
How could it be unrelated?

14
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,940
You don't know

15
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,900
what domestic violence is.

16
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,180
So you mean you know?

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,460
From what I know,

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,260
Nan Ya has long suffered
from Xu Yi's domestic violence.

19
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,380
What has
the Qingshui Police Station done

20
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,700
about this?

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,460
As for whether Xu Yi was guilty
in the bridge collapse case,

22
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,180
or whether Nan Ya acted in self-defense,

23
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,420
is there a logical causal relationship
between them?

24
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,180
Nan Ya wanted a divorce

25
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,820
and her daughter's custodianship.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,980
Her only leverage
is the evidence she mentioned.

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,420
She used Xu Yi's criminal evidence

28
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,900
to negotiate with him,

29
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,020
but it irritated him unexpectedly.

30
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,660
The weaker party
is not always in the right.

31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,380
In past cases of homicide,

32
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
it's hard to decide whether the culprits
did it out of self-defense.

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,260
Can I consider

34
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,220
that a person must have studied medicine

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
and have experience in anatomy

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,820
to accurately claim self-defense?

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,820
It is said that Nan Ya is profligate

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,700
and seduces men everywhere.

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
But these sayings were
all fabricated by Xu Yi.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,540
He claimed that Nan Ya cheated on him.

41
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,900
Did anyone see that?

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,060
Officer Lin.

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,940
Actually, yes.

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,820
See?

45
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,700
Also,

46
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,900
everyone saw what happened
at the train station.

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,140
You're just being swayed by sympathy.

48
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,660
Think about Wang Guihong.

49
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,740
Sir,

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
this is a murder case.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,780
We will definitely proceed with caution

53
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,860
and won't wrongly accuse
an innocent person.

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,780
We also won't

55
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,540

No.

75
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,980
Chen Jun has called you so many times,

76
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,900
but you didn't show up.

77
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,260

About what happened that day,

79
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,940
just pretend it didn't happen, okay?

80
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,780
We'll still be the same as before.

He's still having a fever.

And now you're asking me
how to deal with this?

184

He agreed

to bear all medical
and nutrient expenses.

186
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,300
That's what he's supposed to do, no?

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Guixiang!

192
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,220
You...

193
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,700
Zhou,

194
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,020
why don't you sign this?

195
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,380
He beat Zhou Luo that badly.

196
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,420
He was too violent.

197
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,660
Yes, he was violent.

198
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,740
But Zhou,

199
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,260
I'm not siding with him.

200
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,660
We're just following
standard procedures here.

201
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,420
If you refuse to settle,

202
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,740
you'll lose fifty thousand yuan.

203
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,780
It isn't a small amount.

204
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,700
So I should ask you about it,

205
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,100
right?

206
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,060
Arrest him.

207
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,980
Arrest him.

208
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,100
Zhou.

209
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,420
Zhou.

210
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,900
No need.

211
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,820
You should leave.

212
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,860
Guixiang.

213
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,500
If you won't let me in,

214
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
at least take this soup.

215
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,100
I've boiled it for the entire afternoon.

216
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,460
You're not injured

217
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,380
and can even cook soup.

218
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,820
But to protect you,

219
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,580
my son got beaten so badly.

220
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,260
Now, I really...

221
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,340
I really think everyone was right.

222
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,260
You're a jinx.

223
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,740
We can't afford to mess with you.

224
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,180
You can say anything you want.

225
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
If you need my help,

226
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,940
I can take care of him.

227
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,260
I'm not pleading for Xu Yi.

228
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,300
He will be sentenced to prison.

229
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,980
And you'll
receive the compensation in full.

230
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,860
I'm really sorry.

231
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,220
Who asked you to do all these things?

232
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,940
We don't need it.

233
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,380
Mom, why are you crying?

234
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,300
Do you know

235
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,540
how heartbroken I am?

236
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,940
Luo, you're too kind and foolish.

237
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,020
They are couples.

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,840
Why did you get involved?

239
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,700
Should I have just stood by
and watched her get beaten to death?

240
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,100
She won't get beaten to death.

241
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,820
She's perfectly fine.

242
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,940
Didn't you see it?

243
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,660
But you

244
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,580
got injured heavily.

245
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,140
That darn Xu Yi.

246
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Did you hear what he said?

247
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,020
What he said was so cruel.

248
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,260
Horrible words.

249
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,620
Xu Yi was talking nonsense.

250
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,420
Don't trust him.

251
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,060
Fine.

252
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,180
Don't be angry.

253
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,540
Remember my words.

254
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,020
Our family will stay out

255
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,780
of that couple's affairs, okay?

256
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,100
How could a man beat a woman up?

257
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,780
I think

258
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,980
Nan Ya should divorce Xu Yi.

259
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,260
Silly kid.

260
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,380
You know nothing.

261
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,820
It isn't that easy to get a divorce.

262
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,300
If Nan Ya gets a divorce,

263
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,540
how will she survive with her daughter?

264
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,620
You don't know about this.

265
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,340
When a couple fights,

266
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,460
they make up in seconds.

267
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,500
Anyway,

268
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,340
you just need

269
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,980
to focus on your recovery

270
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,500

Oh right. Have some soup.

276
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,260
I can't explain it clearly right now.

277
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,740
I'll tell you later when I get back.

278
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,140
Is my brother's condition serious?

279
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,780
Okay.

280
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,060
I got it.

281
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,060
I...

282
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,060
Okay, I got it.

283
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,380
Let me deal with my problems here, okay?

284
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,100
I'll head back as soon as possible.

[Public Health Station]

When Zhou Luo is in the hospital,

you'll be his caregiver.

288
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,740
Okay.

00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,900
You'll prepare three meals a day

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,020
that must be nutritious.

See if it's okay.

293
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,180
Is this okay?

294
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,980
There must be soup as well.

There is soup actually.

For the soup,

297
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,820
it must be different for each meal.

298
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,540

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,140
No need.

324
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,660

to be a witness

in jail for 15 days.

00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,340
Mommy,

380
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,300
can I play bamboo dragonfly
with the nurse?

381
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,660
Don't get too far.

382
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,420
Okay.

383
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,180
Are you still mad at me?

384
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,420
Look at me.

385
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,380
Can you just consider it
as the punishment I deserve

386
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,780
for offending you earlier?

387
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,740
I'm just

388
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,780
a science student
with little literary knowledge.

389
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,940
At most, I read detective novels.

390
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,580
I don't know anything

391
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,220
about poetry.

392
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,340
That's why I misinterpreted it

393
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,140
and

394
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,300
said those things I didn't mean.

395
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,780
Zhou Luo.

396
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,420
I'm grateful for your help.

397
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,340
I'll take care of you
until you get discharged.

398
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,460
Stop mentioning the past.

399
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,620
I don't care

400
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,780
about how you think of me.

401
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,460
You don't have to gain my forgiveness.

402
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,820
Ultimately,

403
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,780
you're still mad at me.

404
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,060
Do you think just
because you took a beating for me,

405
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,100
I should be grateful,

406
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,900
forgive you,

407
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,620
and forget what you said before?

408
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,180
I didn't think much that day.

409
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,540
Gratitude and forgiveness
can't be exchanged.

410
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,260
Let me

411
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,060
read a poem for you, okay?

412
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,860
Okay.

413
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,500
The poem's name is "Frustrating Things".

414
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,340
Luo, what does "frustrating" mean?

415
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,780
Frustrating means

416
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,580
encountering things that make you

417
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,660
feel really sad.

418
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,300
It's like something is making you upset.

419
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,060
Just like me.

420
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,940
For example,
you don't understand English

421
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,100
but you've found a good detective novel

422
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,300
that hasn't been translated into German.

423
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,620
Seeing a cold beer when it's hot out,

424
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,900
but can't afford it.

425
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,260
Having a new idea

426
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,700
but you can't encapsulate
in a line of Hölderlin's poem,

427
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,940
just like the way the professors do.

428
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,500
During a late-night journey,

429
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,980
hearing the waves lapping
against the shore

430
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,900
and telling yourself

431
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,060
it's what they always do.

432
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,780
And the extremely frustrating thing is

433
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,580
being invited,

434
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,540
but you've found
your own room at home is quieter,

435
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,460
and the coffee is better.

436
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,180
And the thing is you don't want
to chat with others.

437
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,700
The most frustrating thing is

438
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,020
you try to salvage a friendship

439
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,340
but end up ruining everything.

440
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,340
You apologize,
but she won't forgive you.

441
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,900
Filled with regret,

442
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,060
but you're unable to turn back time.

443
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,780
The most frustrating thing is

444
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,500
you didn't die in summer,

445
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,060
when the days are long,

446
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,180
and it's easy to dig a grave
with a shovel.

447
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,740
Dr. Jiang. Dr. Jiang!

448
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,900
You'll know if you go there.

449
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,540
It's a surprise.

450
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,620
Dr. Jiang.

451
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,020
Wanwan is having a fever.

452
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm not on duty today.

453
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,700
Please examine her.

454
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,220
You usually give her treatment.

455
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,580
Well, Zhao, check her temperature.

456
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,860
Okay. Come with me.

457
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,420
Okay.

458
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,020
She was beaten up

459
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,500
but still delivers food every day.

460
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,180
Everything comes with a price.

461
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
She thought she'd live a carefree life
after marrying a wealthy man,

462
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,940
but turns out he's a wife beater.

463
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,660
This time, Nan Ya has really
messed with her in-laws.

464
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,140
I heard Xu Yi's family

465
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,660
forced her to plead for bail,

466
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,900
but she refused.

467
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,820
The Xu Family claimed

468
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
they would destroy her shop.

469
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,460
Just destroy it.

470
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,780
They forked out the money
so she could open it, anyway.

471
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,980
Why would Nan Ya be afraid?

472
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,860
She used her own money
to open the fashion store.

473
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,940
Otherwise, Xu Yi would've
closed it down ages ago.

474
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,780
What are you doing?

475
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,180
You've finished all your work?

476
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,980
I'll deliver the medicine to bed No. 17.

477
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,580
Why does she have a fever again?

478
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,300
How many times have I told you?

479
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,700
She must avoid catching colds
and having fevers.

480
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,740
You know that well.

481
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,940
She got infected at the kindergarten.

482
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,700
I know you're busy,

483
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,620
but if you insist
on taking care of her yourself,

484
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,980
you must make every effort

485
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,740
to avoid all kinds of situations
where she could easily get infected,

486
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,820
such as crowds

487
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,740
and certain environments.

488
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,340
If you can't avoid them,

489
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,660
you can ask Xu Yi
to hire a nanny for you.

490
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,580
Ah, right.

491
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,140
I forgot.

492
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,220
When she grows up,

493
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,060
she'll need to live a life
like a normal person.

494
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,020
She'll need to go to school
sooner or later.

495
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,820
Now, she's not a normal kid.

496
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,380
Let me tell you this one last time.

497
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,500
If this goes on,

498
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,300
she'll have to prepare
for dialysis soon.

499
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Mommy.

500
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,700
You don't have
to deliver me meals tomorrow.

501
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Just take care of yourself.

502
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,060
You don't have to worry about this.

503
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,220
I went to the hospital's canteen.

504
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,140
It's good.

505
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,820
You can eat at the canteen
if you want.

506
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,020
I'll deliver your meals on time.

507
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,500
Is Wanwan getting better?

508
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,340
She's fine.

509
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,180
What about you?

510
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,540
Now that things
have gotten to this point,

511
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,620
why won't you get a divorce?

512
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,740
I have my reasons
for not getting a divorce.

513
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,540
We're not living in ancient times.

514
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Nowadays, marriage is
a matter of personal choice.

515
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,500
Plus, Xu Yi has a history
of domestic violence.

516
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,980
If you sue him in court,

517
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,300
the court won't rule in favor of him.

518
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,380
How old are you?

519
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,940
I'm an adult just like you.

520
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,180
We're different.

521
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,420
How so?

522
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Not everyone has a variety of choices.

523
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,700
That's because they're not brave enough.

524
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,620
Why did you marry Xu Yi
in the first place?

525
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,780
Little bird, fly.

526
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:22,380
Fly...

527
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,060
Two more rounds.

528
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,540
Okay.

529
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,580
Your shoes are falling off.

530
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,540
Little bird, fly.

531
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,460
Stop spinning.

532
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,580
Don't you feel dizzy?

533
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,220
Little bird, fly...

534
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,260
Where has it gone?

535
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,300
Into the flowers.

536
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,820
Luo.

537
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,020
You're out?

538
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
Mom, why are you here?

539
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,780
Your uncle is much better now.

540
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,500
And Nan Ya is unable to get out.

541
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,820
I'm here to take care of you.

542
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,900
Why is she unable to get out?

543
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,740
Wanwan is sick again?

544
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,180
No.

545
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,300
The Xu Family

546
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,740
is evil.

547
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,100
They've hired a famous lawyer

548
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,740
to try to get Xu Yi out of jail.

549
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,500
They are blocking Nan Ya at her doorstep

550
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,020
and forcing her to testify.

551
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,460
They even came to my shop
to intimidate me.

552
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,740
But I'm not afraid of them.

553
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,180
So what if they are
rich and influential?

554
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,220
They are really good
at bullying their daughter-in-law.

555
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,500
Mom, how did they bully Nan Ya?

556
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,700
I don't know.

557
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,660
I didn't see it.

558
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,900
She's famous for being wily.

559
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,700
Such an evil mother-in-law.

560
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,020
I cooked delicious food for you.

561
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,660
Have some.

562
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,980
Nan Ya!

563
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,020
I'm here to see if you're fine.

564
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,940
If you're fine, I'll leave now.

565
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,740
Stop right there.

566
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,820
Come here and sit down.

567
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Put your feet in.

568
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
It's late and raining heavily.

569
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,180
Why did you come here?

570
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,420
Well...

571
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,340
It started raining
when I was halfway here.

572
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,420
I said something wrong that day.

573
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,660
I know.

574
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,180
It's always like this.

575
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,340
I don't think that way,

576
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,340
but those words

577
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,020
just come out of my mouth
as if I've gone mad.

578
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,100
When I see you,

579
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,260
I can't talk properly.

580
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,220
It has been over a month

581
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,740
since I went to your shop last time.

582
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,340
Do you know how frustrated

583
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,740
I've been feeling lately?

584
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,900
It's like you've swallowed
a fist-sized rice cake

585
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,500
but it gets stuck in your throat.

586
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,020
It neither goes up nor goes down.

587
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,300
I apologized to you,
but you refused to accept my apology.

588
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,700
I took a beating for you,
but you didn't appreciate it.

589
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,740
I don't know what I should do

590
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,020
to earn your forgiveness.

591
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,660
If you ask me to do something now,

592
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,700
I won't hesitate

593
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,820
to do it.

594
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,900
The rain is nothing.

595
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,540
If I don't speak out what I'm thinking,

596
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,460
I'm gonna die.

597
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,420
You're acting like a child
throwing a tantrum

598
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,500
and rolling on the floor for candy.

599
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,460
Yes.

600
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
If I could roll on the floor,

601
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,940
I would be on the ground right now.

602
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,220
I don't care what you think.

603
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,540
But I need to tell you

604
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,580
my real thoughts.

605
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,060
In my eyes,

606
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,220
you're definitely not

607
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,940
the person I spoke recklessly about
on that day.

608
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,900
I wanted to hurl insults

609
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,220
because I felt ashamed.

610
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,460
I thought by insulting others,

611
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,100
I wouldn't look shameful.

612
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,820
Later, I thought about it
for a long time.

613
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,060
Perhaps I'm just like

614
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,380
the others in town.

615
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,380
Deep down, we're all cowards

616
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,540
and incompetent.

617
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,780
Once we come
across something we don't understand,

618
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,900
we rush to discredit it.

619
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,780
I read that poetry collection

620
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,900
and other books after that.

621
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm too ignorant.

622
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,300
To be honest,

623
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,420
I didn't know what beauty was.

624
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,100
I've seen famous paintings

625
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,700
and witnessed beautiful landscapes,

626
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,900
but those beautiful things
just passed before my eyes,

627
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,940
never stirring any waves in my heart.

628
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,980
I even felt that beauty
is something shallow.

629
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,340
But ever since I met you,

630
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,580
everything has changed.

631
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,700
It's you who taught me

632
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,700
when I see beautiful people,

633
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,100
beautiful things,

634
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,500
and beautiful poems,

635
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,980
it's like my heart is electrified.

636
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,660
It's a tremor from deep within my body.

637
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,820
You want to possess it,

638
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
but

639
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,900
you're afraid of tarnishing it.

640
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,220
Sometimes, you even feel

641
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,580
that the desire to possess it

642
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,620
is a form of tarnishment.

643
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,620
Do you understand?

644
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,020
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

645
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
I just want...

646
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,780
I just want you to forget

647
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,540
what I ever told you

648
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,620
and the hurtful things I did to you.

649
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,020
Because those are not true.

650
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,500
It's late.

651
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,700
It isn't convenient
for you to stay here.

652
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,380
I'm used to others gossiping about me.

653
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,380
I don't want to involve you,

654
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,180
or Guixiang will kill me.

655
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,340
You should leave when the rain stops.

656
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,540
That day, how did you know
something happened at my house?

657
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,220
Isn't that obvious?

658
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,020
Wanwan is still young.

659
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,820
How could you let her walk so far?

660
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,620
Besides,

661
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,940
Hu Xiu isn't close to her.

662
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,060
You were doing that

663
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,860
to avoid her

664
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,100
seeing it.

665
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,500
That's why you told her to go away.

666
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,300
Ya.

667
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,660
What did you call me?

668
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,940
Ya?

669
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,860
Both of us

670
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,860
studied at Qingshui No. 1 High School.

671
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,900
We graduated from the same school.

672
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,420
I can call you Ya, right?

673
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,020
Which poem do you like most

674
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,060
from that poetry collection?

675
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,940
It has been too long. I don't remember.

676
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,220
This is my favorite.

677
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,500
[Two roads diverged in a yellow wood]

678
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,660
[And sorry I could not travel both]

679
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,760
[And be one traveler, long I stood]

680
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,600
[And looked down one as far as I could]

681
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,300
[To where it bent in the undergrown]

682
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,930
[Though as for that the passing there]

683
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,930
[Had worn them really about the same]

684
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,500
[And both that morning equally lay]

685
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,300
[In leaves no step had trodden black]

686
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,900
[Then took the other, as just as fair]

687
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,400
[And having perhaps the better claim]

688
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,500
[Because it was grassy and wanted wear]

689
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,330
[Oh, I kept the first for another day]

690
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,130
[Yet knowing how way leads on to way]

691
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,930
[I doubted if I should ever come back]

692
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,100
[I shall be telling this with a sigh]

693
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,200
[Somewhere ages and ages]

694
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,560
[hence]

695
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,460
[Two roads diverged in a wood, and I]

696
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,130
[I took the one less traveled by]

697
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,840
[And that has made all the difference]

698
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Ya,

699
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,580
don't you think this poem

700
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,780
is a bit creepy?

701
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,380
How is it creepy?

702
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm walking on the road

703
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,140
but keep on thinking.

704
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,220
I can't stop thinking

705
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,900
forever.

706
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,740
Ya,

707
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,420
you didn't choose the other road.

708
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,460
What do you think its scenery will be?

709
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,540
Zhou Luo.

710
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,420
Are you free?

711
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,860
Come up and have a talk with me.

712
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:12,090
[The sixth day after the incident,
(January 6, 2000)]

713
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,900
You're coming back so late.

714
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,580
Come in and have a seat.

715
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,660
The house is messy.

716
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
Please don't mind.

717
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,700
Before making things clear,

718
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,820
we can't directly conclude

719
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,140
that Nan Ya acted in self-defense.

720
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,620
Besides, in this case,

721
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,860
there are still many doubt points.

722
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,020
So

723
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,740
I'd like to know more about her.

724
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,060
Can I sit?

725
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,820
Go ahead.

726
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,300
It's a bit messy.

727
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,180
Nan Ya often went
to the town library to borrow books.

728
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,580
Guixiang told me

729
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,660
you often went there, too.

730
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,660
Have you met her there?

731
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,260
Yes.

732
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,900
What did you talk about?

733
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,220
We don't usually talk in the library.

734
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,340
It isn't convenient to do so.

735
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,980
I don't believe it.

736
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,820
It's up to you to believe it or not.

737
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Nan Ya.

738
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,140
Indeed.

739
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,980
I discovered a coincidence, though.

740
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,980
Both of you have
very similar reading interests.

741
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,980
Really?

742
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,620
Look

743
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,900
at these library cards.

744
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,500
You borrowed all the books

745
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,940
Nan Ya had borrowed previously.

746
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,820
You both have similar interests.

747
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
You were supposed

748
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,220
to be good friends.

749
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,620
The town library only has
eight thousand books in its collection.

750
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,980
Some are about agricultural education,

751
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,300
and some are children's books.

752
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,540
There are also some

753
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,020
low-quality martial arts romance novels.

754
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,580
Other than that,

755
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,700
I've read all of them.

756
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,940
According to you,

757
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,260
I could make friends

758
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,580
with anyone in town

759
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
who goes to the town library
to borrow books.

760
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,540
You're right.

761
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,620
Fanglu,

762
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,060
you and Nan Ya were classmates, right?

763
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,500
Do you need to avoid arousing suspicion

764
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,420
when investigating this case?

765
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,140
Will you cover up for her?

766
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,660
Nan Ya was known for being
the prettiest girl at school back then.

767
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,340
Have you ever talked to her?

768
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,860
How's your relationship with her?

769
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,140
Have you ever contacted her
over the years?

770
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,340
What is she like to you?

771
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,940
Yes.

772
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,660
We were classmates,

773
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,140
but that was decades ago.

774
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,420
You know us well.

775
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,420
If you're interested...

776
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,460
I'm not interested

777
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,580
in your affairs.

778
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,820
How did you find out about that, then?

779
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,180
Mr. Zheng told me so.

780
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,980
He is our class adviser.

781
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,780
You asked

782
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,900
if I'll cover up for her.

783
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,700
I want to know your opinion.

784
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,420
If it were you,

785
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,140
and she is a former classmate of yours

786
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,020
who you were close with

787
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,140
and talked with

788
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,580
but didn't keep in touch
for years after graduation.

789
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,340
Now, you're suddenly tasked with
handling her case upon your return.

790
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,300
Would you cover up for her?

791
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,700
It would depend
on your personal character.

792
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,100
Fanglu, you may continue
reading your book.

793
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm sleepy. I'll go back and sleep.

794
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:12,830
[My Best Memory]

795
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,060
Sir,

796
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,700
this is a murder case.

797
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,260
We will definitely proceed with caution

798
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,820
in the investigation

799
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,380
and won't wrongly accuse
an innocent person.

800
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,380
We also won't

801
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,980
let any bad guys get away with it.
