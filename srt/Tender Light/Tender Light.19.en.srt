00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 19]

2
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,780
Lesson 33.

3
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,900
A day to remember.

4
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,340
Listen to the tape,
then answer the question below.

5
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,100
We've all experienced days

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,740
when everything goes wrong.

7
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,340
A day may begin well enough,

8
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,260
but suddenly, everything seems
to get out of control.

9
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,220
What invariably happens

10
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,020
is that a great number of things

11
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,020
choose to go wrong
at precisely the same moment.

12
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,220
Qingli, the food is ready. Come and eat.

13
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
Let her be.

14
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,300
Those two.

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,900
What on earth is going on with them?

16
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,500
This is really weird.

17
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,020
Let's say the two are in a relationship.

18
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,780
It's not a big deal.

19
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,620
I mean, they're old enough.

20
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,900
Regarding Zhou Luo,
I don't have a problem with him.

21
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,740
But did they have to tell

22
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,420
the whole world about it?

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,540
That Liu Xun started it.

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,500
Liu Xun's father is dead,
so he lost his mind.

25
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,180
But in that recording,

26
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,460
it was Officer Lin's

27
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,980
and Qingli's voices.

28
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,740
Do you think this

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,260
is related to what happened

30
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,380
to Xu Yi?

31
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,020
I've been wondering

32
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,620
about one thing.

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,820
On the night of the millennium,

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,980
at the place where the car was burned,

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,180
I saw a back.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,700
Who was it?

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,820
I think it was Zhou Luo.

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,220
Zhou Luo?

39
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,660
Is that you, Zhou Luo?

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,620
Stop!

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,460
Zhou Luo?

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,820
Did you see him clearly?

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,940
It was dark that night.

44
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,140
The clothes they were wearing
were pretty much the same too.

45
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,020
I called him,

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,420
but he ran off without looking back.

47
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,340
It's impossible to determine who it was.

48
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,140
Something is surely up with Zhou Luo.

49
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,940
Otherwise, why are the police
so keen on him?

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,980
Since he came,

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,300
many problems have arisen at Huashan.

52
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,700
I'd rather not have accepted
this top scorer.

53
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,020
Huashan would still
keep a good reputation.

54
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,300
Ling.

55
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,380
What benefits did she give you

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,820
to make you do all these for her?

57
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,340
How exactly did Xu Yi die?

58
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,540
I've already told the police.

59
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,620
You're lying.

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,540
What were you doing
at her house so late?

61
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,140
I was taking Wanwan home.

62
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,940
Zhou Luo,

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,580
there's something fishy between you two.

64
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,900
You think I didn't see

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,420
you two secretly meeting
at the hospital?

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,780
I saw you.

67
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,820
What were you two talking about
by the garden that late?

68
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Nothing.

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,380
It's a secret, huh?

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,220
Why do I have to tell you?

71
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,980
Why is it you're always there
whenever she's in trouble?

72
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,220
You were at the train station too
when they caught her cheating.

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,540
And the night of the millennium.

74
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,100
You just so happened to see
that crucial moment.

75
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,900
Isn't it all too coincidental?

76
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,700
You two were in collusion, weren't you?

77
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,900
You deliberately kept Wanwan with you.

78
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,140
That way, you'd have a reason
to go to her house.

79
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,540
You didn't go a minute earlier or later,
but right when the action happened.

80
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,700
Speak up!

81
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,220
Tell me how he really died.

82
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,900
What's wrong with you, Chen Ling?
What are you doing?

83
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,260
They two were in collusion!

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,340
Have you lost your mind?

85
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,700
Go look for Nan Ya
to settle your grievances.

86
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,780
How you two

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,580
want to fight over a man
has nothing to do with us.

88
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,900
Don't drag my son into the mess.

89
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,140
Who said I was fighting
over a man with her?

90
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,700
She and Xu Yi were married.

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,580
What were you
when you were stuck in between?

92
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,260
You're just protecting him
because he's your son.

93
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
Go ahead and ask him

94
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,220
if he's telling the truth.

95
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
Let go of him!

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,020
Ask him!

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
Are you insane?

98
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,540
I'm not insane!

99
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,140
Ling,

100
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,020
what are you doing at their house?

101
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,460
They colluded to kill Xu Yi!

102
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,380
Shut up!

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,380
Chen Jun, do you believe me or him?

104
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,300
Let's go home.

105
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,460
I won't.

106
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,140
Bring your sister back. Now!

107
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,940
Go home.

108
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,780
Let me go.

109
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,460
I'm going to find out the truth!

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,820
Nothing to see here!

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,540
Come on, let's go home.
She's really lost her mind.

112
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,940
Ignore her.

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,220
She's crazy.

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,100
That Chen Ling has really gone crazy.

115
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,100
So infuriating.

116
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,860
Where are you off to?

117
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,100
Going for a stroll.

118
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,340
I need a breather.

119
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,700
What's up with everybody?

120
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,740
Lesson 35.

121
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,300
Justice was done.

122
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,620
Listen to the tape,

123
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,460
then answer the question below.

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
We might say that

125
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,580
justice has been done

126
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,820
when a man's innocence or guilt
has been proven beyond doubt.

127
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,780
Justice

128
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,540
is part of the complex machinery
of the law.

129
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,660
Those who seek it

130
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,100
undertake an arduous journey.

131
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,460
And can never be sure

132
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,220
that they will find it.

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,780
Judges, however wise or eminent,

134
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,980
are human

135
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,780
and can make mistakes.

136
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,270
[Tender Light]

137
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Don't you push me.

138
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,500
Let go.

139
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,140
I'm not going back. Stop bothering me!

140
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,580
Don't you know
you look pitiful right now?

141
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,260
I've never seen you in this state.

142
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,540
What about me?

143
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,700
Get inside, now!

144
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,700
Have you not
embarrassed yourself enough?

145
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,620
Get inside!

146
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,620
Ling.

147
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,460
What's going on?

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,660
Ask her.

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,700
What is it?

150
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
She went and made a scene
at Zhou Luo's house.

151
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,020
So embarrassing.

152
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,580
How was I embarrassed?

153
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,660
Chen Ling,

154
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,900
how long has it been
since you broke up with Xu Yi?

155
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,620
Why are you still hanging up on it?

156
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,740
Do you know how this family
has been living in the past few years?

157
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,100
We've been adapting to your disposition.

158
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,740
Watching every word we say.

159
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,540
When you're happy,
the whole family rejoices.

160
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,780
When you're unhappy,
all of us have to hold our breath.

161
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,340
Yes,

162
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,300
Xu Yi had wronged you.

163
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
But it's been six years.

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,620
If you still can't get over it,
then it's your problem.

165
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,500
I don't need you to lecture me.

166
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,220
That's enough.

167
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,420
I haven't finished!

168
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,100
What was so great about Xu Yi?

169
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,780
He's already dead,
and yet you still can't let go.

170
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,420
If I were you,
I'd have bought firecrackers

171
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,780
and celebrated!

172
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,380
I'd have at least admired you, then.

173
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
Are you looking down on me now?

174
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,460
Yes.

175
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
In my heart,

176
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,380
you used to be a generous,

177
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,380
loyal,

178
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,420
and reliable older sister.

179
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,260
But look at you now.

180
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,300
Have you looked yourself in the mirror?

181
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,300
You're nothing more
than a resentful woman.

182
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,060
As a man, not even I would want you.

183
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,980
Why are you making yourself so pathetic?

184
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,580
Don't speak of your sister like that.

185
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,620
Chen, stop hitting him! Stop it!

186
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,860
Am I wrong?

187
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,220
If you find me embarrassing,

188
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,860
you can sever your ties with me.

189
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,980
Ling.

190
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,300
Don't say such things.

191
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,860
There are plenty of other men.

192
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,540
Why can't you just get over him?

193
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,860
You want me to be with whom?

194
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,780
Jiang Zhi?

195
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,020
He's touched every one
of the hospital's nurses.

196
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,220
Fine.

197
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,020
If you think I'm embarrassing,

198
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,100
I'll go ahead and marry him tomorrow.

199
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,940
I never said you should be
with Jiang Zhi.

200
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,140
Didn't you guys say

201
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,380
that he's a doctor

202
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,540
and financially stable,

203
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,460
so he's dependable?

204
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,540
I forgot

205
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,020
when Xu Yi came to pay a visit,

206
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,260
you two were so delighted as well.

207
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,180
He was also a guy you two found for me.

208
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,220
How come you won't admit it now?

209
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,980
Ling, it was my fault, my mistake.

210
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,820
We failed to see him
for who he really was.

211
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,780
I'm sorry, Ling.

212
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,980
You guys didn't do anything wrong.
It's my own fault.

213
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,180
Whatever happened between Xu Yi and me,

214
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,180
only I know.

215
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Who are you people to judge me?

216
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,620
What did I ever do wrong?

217
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,140
It's been years.

218
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,380
They were the ones who betrayed me.

219
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,700
But why is everyone criticizing me?

220
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,100
What did I do to deserve this?

221
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,100
He died mysteriously.

222
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,540
All I want is to find out what happened.

223
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,700
I just want to know

224
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,620
if what he told me
that afternoon was true.

225
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,100
He promised me.

226
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,020
Mom.

227
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,060
My heart hurts.

228
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
That's enough.

229
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,420
Qingli, come.

230
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,580
Eat.

231
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,540
Good girl.

232
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,540
Eat with Dad.

233
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,340
Let's eat.

234
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,540
Let's eat, Qingli.

235
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,860
It's no use begging me.

236
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,300
Dad,

237
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,380
please let Zhou Luo go back to school.

238
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,580
I promise I'll study hard.

239
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,460
No way. I'm not letting him stay
in Huashan any longer.

240
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,740
Dad.

241
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,660
Be nice.

242
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
Just pretend it never happened.

243
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,340
Trust me. I'm totally fine.

244
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,460
If you're fine, why did you say
those things to the police?

245
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,020
Go ask Officer Lin
if you want to know why.

246
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,020
Okay, eat first.

247
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,820
You tell me.

248
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,420
What exactly did you guys do that night?

249
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,380
I can't say. I can't!

250
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,700
Why can't you say it, Qingli?

251
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,820
Then, Zhou Luo will
never go back to school.

252
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,380
Why are you kicking him out?
This is my own issue.

253
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,540
It's unrelated to him.

254
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,020
How is it unrelated?

255
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,940
You're a girl, but you
don't care about your reputation at all.

256
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,540
You think other people

257
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,900
would simply believe
Officer Lin's words?

258
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,660
Have you got any idea
what other people would say?

259
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,860
Gossip is a fearful thing.

260
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,060
No need to shout.

261
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,140
I don't care.

262
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,300
Qingli,

263
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,260
what do you mean you don't care?
You're a girl.

264
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,420
I don't care!

265
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,340
You don't care?

266
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,420
I've been working
in education my whole life.

267
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Now that I'm old,

268
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,540
my reputation is suddenly

269
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,380
ruined.

270
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,340
Okay, that's enough.

271
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,940
Qingli, we're done talking about this.
Eat your food.

272
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,100
Eat your food.

273
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,580
If Zhou Luo isn't continuing to study,
neither will I.

274
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,740
What are you saying, Qingli?

275
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,660
I said if Zhou Luo doesn't
continue to study,

276
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,220
Neither will I! Got that?

277
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,580
Qingli, what are you talking about?

278
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,140
I'm not eating. You guys can eat.

279
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,780
What? You...

280
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,700
Qingli!

281
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,820
So annoying.

282
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,980
I told you not to talk about it.

283
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,460
You just wouldn't stop.

284
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,300
Now look.

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,140
You can eat by yourself.

286
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,820
Luo, where are you going this late?

287
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,700
Going for a run.

288
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,660
Isn't it too late for a run?

289
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,780
I can sleep better after a run.

290
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,540
Mom, call the police.

291
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Something happened at Nan Ya's house.

292
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,660
What?

293
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,660
A man who hits a woman is just a jerk.

294
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,260
If you ask me,

295
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,660
Nan Ya should just divorce Xu Yi.

296
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,020
Luo! Luo, what happened?

297
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,900
Mom, take Wanwan back.
Don't let her see.

298
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,100
You hurry back too.

299
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,460
It's all right, baby. Don't cry.

300
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,740
She hasn't come out
of her room the whole day.

301
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,260
Come and eat.

302
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,180
No, I'm not eating.

303
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,580
You shouldn't skip breakfast.

304
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
What are you doing here?

305
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,780
I'm looking for something.

306
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,980
Looking for what?

307
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,860
Where did it go?

308
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,540
I'm not feeling well today.
I dropped the tablets.

309
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,900
What's the problem?

310
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,780
Are you okay?

311
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,940
I'm fine.

312
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,980
My throat's a little dry, that's all.
See? My voice is hoarse.

313
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,660
Let me know if you're unwell.
Don't simply take medication.

314
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,260
I need to go to the restroom.

315
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,300
Tear this off and tear it clean.

316
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,220
Then, put up this honor board
of the exam.

317
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,900
Stick this up. Make one more

318
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,260
commendation notice
of Zhou Luo's admission

319
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,940
to Jinghua with a reduced offer.

320
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,180
Hang on. Sir, that's...

321
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,820
Just two days ago, we put up a notice
of criticism. Now, it's commendation?

322
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,420
Never mind that.

323
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,660
The higher-ups are coming
for an inspection,

324
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,260
and our school was added
at the last minute.

325
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,660
This shows they pay a lot
of attention to us.

326
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,460
We have to make use of this opportunity.

327
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,740
Once the leaders leave,

328
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,980
you can remove the notice.

329
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,700
The students might not even see it.

330
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Understand?

331
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,020
Okay, will do.

332
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,000
[Notice of Commendation]

333
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,740
Director Su.

334
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,580
Mr. Zhang.

335
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,900
Welcome, welcome.
Please follow me inside.

336
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,820
[Huashan Cram School]
It's wonderful to hear

337
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,020
[Xingchen Vocational School]
that you were able

338
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,220
to send a student
from this town to Jinghua.

339
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,620
Yes.

340
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,500
This time,

341
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,580
I must come and have a visit.

342
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,780
Mr. Zhang,

343
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,580
why don't you introduce your school?

344
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,020
Huashan Cram School

345
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,420
currently has 168 students.

346
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,620
There are two Science classes

347
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,260
and one Arts class.

348
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,940
Are the students all from this town?

349
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,620
Not to brag or anything.

350
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,340
Huashan is kind of famous now.

351
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,300
There are not only kids
from nearby towns,

352
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,260
but even children from other counties

353
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,300
have also come to study at Huashan.

354
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,700
Students,

355
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,460
this is Director Su
from the Education Bureau.

356
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,100
Let's give him a warm welcome.

357
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,460
Mr. Zhang, what are they doing?

358
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,580
Are there no classes today?

359
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,820
I hope you don't mind
giving a short speech

360
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,580
to encourage these kids.

361
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,820
They're all repeat students

362
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,500
and need more encouragement.

363
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,100
Which one is Zhou Luo?

364
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,620
He took the day off today,
so he's not here.

365
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,180
Is he ill?

366
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,700
I think something happened at his home.

367
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,500
What a pity.

368
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,580
I was hoping to meet the boy.

369
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,740
I know where Zhou Luo lives.

370
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,020
Go and get him, then.

371
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,660
Yes, sir.

372
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,580
The mental outlook of students
at our school

373
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,980
is pretty good.

374
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,140
Guixiang!

375
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,180
Is Zhou Luo home?

376
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,140
What's up?

377
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,500
The county leader
is here for an inspection.

378
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,260
He's at Huashan

379
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,500
and wishes to meet Zhou Luo.

380
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,460
County leader?

381
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,540
What did Mr. Zhang say?

382
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,540
Stop asking. Ask him to go with me.

383
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,220
Oh, I... Wait here. I'll go and get him.

384
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,740
Okay.

385
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,900
I hope everyone maintains
an optimistic spirit

386
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,220
and high morale.

387
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,020
Let's all follow
in Zhou Luo's footsteps.

388
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,380
Yes!

389
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,260
Zhou Luo!

390
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,340
Come here.

391
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,540
Come on up here.

392
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,580
Director Su, this is Zhou Luo.

393
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,780
Zhou Luo, you are a role model
for Qingshui Town.

394
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,540
Come on, Mr. Zhang.
Let's take a group photo.

395
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,340
Yes, sure.

396
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,740
Okay, everyone look at me.

397
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,620
Look this way. Smile.

398
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,580
Grin. There we go.

399
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,500
Okay, once more.

400
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,380
I thought your dad wouldn't allow
Zhou Luo to go back to school.

401
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,540
One more.

402
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,500
Okay.

403
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:15,430
[Notice of Commendation.
Congratulations to Zhou Luo]

404
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,180
In a dilemma, huh?

405
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,100
Pardon?

406
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,140
It's difficult to decide
whether to expel Zhou Luo or not?

407
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,180
If you expel him,

408
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,340
Huashan is going
to lose the only student

409
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,420
who will be admitted
by Jinghua in years.

410
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,700
The leaders are all watching.

411
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,940
If you don't expel him,

412
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,020
you can't get past yourself.

413
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,580
Your daughter was taken advantage of,

414
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,860
but you couldn't vent your anger.

415
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,420
Are you here to laugh at me?

416
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,260
Of course not.

417
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,180
I'm here to find out exactly

418
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,500
how powerful and capable Zhou Luo is.

419
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,740
What really happened

420
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,100
to them that night?

421
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm not going to say anything.

422
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,740
Moreover, there's no need for me to.

423
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,580
Why?

424
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,580
Because

425
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,260
I don't believe
what they told me that day at all.

426
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
Officer Lin,

427
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,180
could you talk to my dad for me?

428
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Tell him
that I was deliberately acting up.

429
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,660
Actually, there was nothing between us.

430
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,780
Didn't you agree

431
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
to keep it secret?

432
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,900
I can help you,

433
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,500
but you must tell me the truth.

434
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,220
Come to me if you want.

435
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
I will take responsibility
for my own actions.

436
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,420
It's true I wasn't with her that night.

437
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,020
Then, where were you that night?

438
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,900
I was at home.

439
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,260
If you were home,
why didn't Qingli see you?

440
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,780
Because I was in the toilet.

441
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,420
You were in the toilet
for an hour and a half?

442
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,980
I had a stomach ache.

443
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,700
I took pills,

444
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,420
and I fell asleep.

445
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,180
I went to the toilet.

446
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,020
I woke up

447
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,540
and went to the riverbank.

448
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Then I sent Wanwan home.

449
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,620
Nobody can prove any of these things.
So does everything I said

450
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,940
not count?

451
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,220
Why exactly are you so hell-bent

452
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,100
on convicting Nan Ya?

453
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,980
Is it to get a promotion,

454
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,700
or there's a personal grudge?

455
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,020
Because I'm a police officer.

456
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,100
It doesn't matter how much
I personally like you,

457
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,980
or because Nan Ya was my classmate,

458
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,380
my duty is to find out the truth

459
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,740
and bring the perpetrator to justice.

460
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,180
When are you coming back?

461
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,260
Soon.

462
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,900
It'll take some time
for the formalities.

463
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,300
I think you're involving

464
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,620
too much of your personal feelings
in this case.

465
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,740
Wenting,

466
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
you're thinking too much.

467
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,660
I'm not.

468
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,180
In my opinion,

469
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,220
this case is simply
justifiable self-defense.

470
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,540
And there's ample evidence
to support it.

471
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,620
I don't know
what you are struggling with, Fanglu.

472
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,180
Have you forgotten
why you went to Qingshui town?

473
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,940
The provincial office
is being reshuffled right now.

474
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,500
You'd better finish it up
and get back as soon as possible.

475
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,420
I just think there
are still doubtful points.

476
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,980
Are you trying to prove

477
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,620
that you're not harboring a criminal?

478
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,940
I don't have to prove anything.

479
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,060
The more you try to draw the line,

480
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,500
the more it speaks of your concern.

481
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,620
Okay, yes. I do care. Why?

482
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,020
What's wrong with that?

483
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,700
I can absolutely go with the flow

484
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,540
and close the case,

485
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,180
but I'm unable to convince myself.

486
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,380
All right?

487
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,460
You happy now?

488
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,020
Just do whatever you want.

489
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,020
I have to finish my thesis.
I'm hanging up.

490
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,180
Seeking advantages and avoiding loss
are human instincts.

491
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,620
Wouldn't you have chosen the same?

492
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,860
Are you saying a woman like me

493
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,460
deserved to be abused by my husband

494
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,860
and not lift a finger in defense?

495
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,380
Where's the photo?

496
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,180
Where did you hide it?

497
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
That photo

498
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,540
is the same one I received as blackmail.

499
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,940
Get over here!

500
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,340
Try to run, huh?

501
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,060
Little birdie flies.

502
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,580
Don't jump. Aren't you dizzy
turning in circles?

503
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,380
Little birdie flies!

504
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,740
Where is it flying to?

505
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,620
It's flying to the flowers.

will be erected like 300 high walls.

512
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
And the sea

513
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,740
will be like a magic show between us.

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,260
The cruel hand of time

515
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,980
will tear apart

517
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,020
that pierce my chest like thorns.

518
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,420
There will be nothing left

519
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,820
but memories.

520
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,900
The dusk is given by sadness.

521
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,180
The night that longs for you.

522
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,420
I found the evidence.

523
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm going to kill Zhou Luo!

524
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,100
Xu Yi!

525
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,540
I'll call the police
if you do anything rash.

526
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,220
Go ahead.

527
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,820
Call the police. I'll just be in jail
for a few days.

528
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,100
I'm telling you right now,
I'll kill him!

529
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,380
I'll tell the police.

530
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,100
You cheating wench!

531
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,260
I never would've expected this.

532
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,660
But...

533
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,900
But why was this recorded?

534
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,340
Maybe it was accidentally recorded.

535
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,460
- That's all?
- That's all.

536
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,700
The killing moment wasn't recorded.

537
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,460
This means my assumption was right.

538
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,500
Nan Ya and Zhou Luo were
putting on an act right from the start.

539
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,100
Zhou Luo has no proof of his whereabouts

540
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,740
for over an hour.

541
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,180
And during this period,
he wasn't at the riverbank,

542
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,940
nor was he at home.

543
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,580
Because he was there at the crime scene.

544
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,300
From the start,
we've been paying all our attention

545
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,260
on Nan Ya.

546
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,180
Let's say they are lovers.

547
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,620
Then, perhaps

548
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,340
there is another possibility
to the case.

549
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,620
The killer isn't Nan Ya...

550
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,500
but Zhou Luo.
