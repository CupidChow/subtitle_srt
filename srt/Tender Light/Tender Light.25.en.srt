00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 25]

2
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,180
Guixiang.

3
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,580
You are here.

4
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,180
As for the money I borrowed
from you last time,

5
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,300
I'll pay back one-third of it first.

6
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,900
I will pay you the rest in two months.

7
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,660
I told you there was no rush.

8
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,700
Don't worry.

9
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,740
I've taken a new clothing order.

10
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,180
It's enough to cover her medical bills.

11
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,420
That's great.

12
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,860
Oh, right.

13
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,540
I've heard

14
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,420
that Hu Xiu wants to sell the house.

15
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,540
Doesn't that belong to the Nan family?

16
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,660
She is selling the house?

17
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,420
That's what I've heard.

18
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,940
I've also heard that she thinks
the house is too big for her,

19
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,900
so she wants to sell it
and move to her sister's place.

20
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,940
All right.

21
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,860
Thank you, Guixiang.

22
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,380
Don't thank me ever again.

23
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,940
I know very well

24
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,060
what you have been through.

25
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
I'm thinking

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,500
that if you could get half of the house,

27
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,580
you and your child
would have a place to stay

28
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,700
even if you leave Xu Yi.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,220
Zhou Luo.

30
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,740
I will put the money away.

31
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,500
What do you want to eat, Wanwan?

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,100
Go ahead.

33
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Lonely God.

34
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,380
I see.

35
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,700
Okay. Here you go.

36
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,260
Don't give her that. It's too salty.

37
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,940
I will replace it with a milk candy.

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,100
Once I recover,
I want to eat many milk candies.

39
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
Sure, I will make sure
you have enough candies.

40
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,420
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

41
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,220
Oh, right.

42
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,140
The town authority

43
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,420
is going to show movies.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,380
Are you coming?

45
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,060
I wanted to take her there.

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,060
I'm going too.

47
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,740
If so, then we won't go.

48
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,060
Why are you like this?

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,940
I... The town authority
is going to show movies.

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,500
Why can't I go?

51
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,900
Mom, I want to watch the movie too.

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,980
Yeah. Can we watch it together?

53
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,020
I promise

54
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,100
I will sit in the very back

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,220
and won't talk to you.

56
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,900
We will see.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,980
Say bye-bye.

58
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,500
Bye-bye, Zhou Luo.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,460
Bye.

60
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,420
Please do come.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,980
Hi, Nan Ya.

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,780
Qingli.

63
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,700
Let's go.

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,020
What were you talking about?

65
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,100
Nothing else.

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,020
It was about Wanwan.

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,820
What is this?

68
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,300
The beef pie made by my mom.

69
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,740
[Tender Light]

70
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,060
It's still hot.

71
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,620
Thank you.

72
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,380
It smells great.

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,820
There are some questions

74
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,740
I don't understand.

75
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,180
Can you teach me?

76
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,300
Sure, no problem.

77
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,220
You are so happy.

78
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,620
All right. Let's go.

79
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,340
This row.

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,420
This seat.

81
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,300
Sit here.

82
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,820
All right, thank you.

83
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,500
Yummy.

84
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,420
Wanwan.

85
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,500
Zhou Luo.

86
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,340
Look.

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,620
What do I look like?

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,540
Stop it.

89
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,900
Which row?

90
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,020
The twelfth row.

91
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,100
Seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth.

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,100
I think it should be there.

93
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,140
Quickly.

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,740
No rush.

95
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,260
It's going to start.

96
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,540
I told you I didn't want to watch this,
but you insisted.

97
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,820
It should be this seat.

98
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,100
This one.

99
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,820
It starts.

100
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,500
Give it to me.

101
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,700
Is it convenient for you to hold it?

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,460
Zhou Luo.

103
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,620
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

104
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,260
- Come over here.
- Zhou Luo.

105
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,100
Sit here. Come on.

106
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,500
Hurry.

107
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,460
You said you didn't want to come.

108
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,900
Why did you come alone?

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,780
We went to your place with the ticket,

110
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
but you weren't there.

111
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,580
Did you?

112
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,220
Tell me if I want to watch movies.

113
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,380
The owner of this cinema is my friend.

114
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,540
You should have told me, so I wouldn't
waste my money on the ticket.

115
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,940
It starts.

116
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,540
Can you focus on the movie?

117
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,340
I... I need to go to the restroom.

118
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,940
Why did you come out?

119
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,140
Wanwan felt it was stuffy inside,

120
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,300
so we came out.

121
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Wanwan,

122
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,060
the dragon isn't fun.

123
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,380
Play with me.

124
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,380
Take off.

125
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,180
How is it?

126
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,100
Is it fun playing with Uncle?

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,980
Yeah. But Zhou Luo,

128
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,860
you are not Uncle.

129
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,580
Zhou Luo, stop it.

130
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,940
They might come out
to look for you if they can't see you.

131
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,740
Save yourself from unnecessary trouble.

132
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,020
Wanwan, let's make a promise.

133
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,420
From now on, whenever you see me,

134
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,220
call me Uncle, all right?

135
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,380
Why?

136
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,180
Well,

137
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,420
your mom and I graduated
from the same school.

138
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
She is my senior.

139
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,260
According to seniority,
you should call me Uncle.

140
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,420
If you call me Uncle,

141
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,300
I will give you lots of delicious food

142
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,620
and take you out to have fun, all right?

143
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,180
What Uncle?

144
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,660
Zhou Luo,

145
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,340
stop it.

146
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,060
Let's fly.

147
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,980
Stop it.

148
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,180
Fly!

149
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,340
The movie is going to end
in a few minutes.

150
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,940
Just stop it.

151
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,020
Let's go!

152
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,660
You should go inside now.

153
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,780
Zhou Luo.

154
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,940
How about I buy you wontons

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,620
from the stall across the street later?

156
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,300
All right, then.

157
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,020
Let's play next time.

158
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm going to watch the movie now.

159
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,780
Do you like spinning around?

160
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Spin.

161
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,860
Spin.

162
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,780
Feeling dizzy?

163
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,220
The cartoon movie is boring.

164
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,460
Romance is just nothing interesting.

165
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,940
But I think it's good.

166
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,100
I realized

167
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,180
that you like weepy movies.

168
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,100
I think

169
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,300
"Young and Dangerous"

170
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,660
and shootout movies
are more interesting.

171
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,380
All right. Let's watch it next time.

172
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,260
So cool.

173
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I will watch it with you next time,
all right?

174
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,100
I... I need to head home.

175
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,140
Don't go. You said you wouldn't come,
but you came alone.

176
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,780
So you must treat us, you know?

177
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Treat you what?

178
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,900
Buy us supper.

179
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm not eating.

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,340
Hurry. Let's go.

181
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,180
I don't eat at night.

182
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,100
Nan Ya.

183
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,020
Qingli, Bingbing.

184
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,220
Chen Jun, Zhou Luo.

185
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,980
Nan Ya is over here.

186
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,420
Let's sit with her.

187
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,580
Take a chair.

188
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,660
Hi, Nan Ya.

189
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,660
What do you want to eat?

190
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,060
Well...

191
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,140
Chen Jun's ordering for us.

192
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,900
Chen Jun, buy something back.

193
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,220
Nan Ya, why is there another bowl
of wontons?

194
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,380
Is anyone coming?

195
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,340
No.

196
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,380
I ordered it for myself.

197
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,300
I was feeding Wanwan.
I haven't eaten yet.

198
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
You can have it.

199
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,340
No, I'll have the skewers.

200
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,660
I will take that.

201
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,820
I... I feel like eating wontons.

202
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
You want to eat this?

203
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,100
Go ahead.

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,300
Here, drink some soup.

205
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:53,780
Hurry.

206
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,740
Come on.

207
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,620
It's going to fall.

208
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,540
Come on.

209
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,820
Slowly.

210
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,740
Zhou Luo, eat some meat.

211
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,100
I only bought one set, Zhou Luo.

212
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,740
Share it with me.

213
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,100
Put it there.

214
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,580
All you know is Zhou Luo.

215
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,420
There are only a few skewers,

216
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,540
and you're giving them all to Zhou Luo.

217
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,220
I just want to thank him

218
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,060
for tutoring me.

219
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,500
Oh, come on.

220
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
I know

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,740
why he's tutoring you.

222
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,620
Both of you plan

223
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,900
to go to university in Beijing, right?

224
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,420
Stop bantering with others.

225
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,700
Why don't you give me a skewer?

226
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,860
Right away.

227
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,700
Nan Ya, do you like the movie?

228
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,740
You were there too?

229
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,580
I didn't see you.

230
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,380
Wanwan and I sat in the back.

231
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,860
She kept saying she wanted
to go to the restroom,

232
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,180
and it was stuffy inside.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,980
So I came out before the movie finished.

234
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,740
See?

235
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,180
I told you it was boring.

236
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,460
Fine.

237
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,060
You guys helped me find Wanwan
last time.

238
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,100
I haven't got the chance
to thank you.

239
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,260
It's on me tonight.

240
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,020
Don't be so courteous.

241
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,660
Actually, we really sympathize with you.

242
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,860
In any case,

243
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,620
a man shouldn't hit a woman.

244
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,140
Why did you bring this up?

245
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,660
Nan Ya,

246
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,740
I have a question for you.

247
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Do you think

248
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,220
one could find true love twice?

249
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,820
Well, true love

250
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,220
is hard to come by.

251
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,420
People with bad luck

252
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
probably wouldn't find one
in their lifetimes.

253
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,860
What about you?

254
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,100
Perhaps I'm the one with bad luck.

255
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,260
If I'm lucky enough,

256
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,300
I will surely cherish it all the more.

257
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,100
Here.

258
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,620
Eat more.

259
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
Why did she talk about that?

260
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,300
It's getting late.

261
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,820
Wanwan needs to go to bed early.

262
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,020
Please enjoy yourselves.

263
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,100
I will bring her home.

264
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,540
Sure.

265
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,380
You can order anything

266
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,460
you want.

267
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,860
You don't need
to be so courteous, Nan Ya.

268
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,820
Just take it.

269
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,660
I said I would buy you supper.

270
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,140
Let's go, Wanwan.

271
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,740
Bye-bye, big brothers and sisters.

272
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,820
Thank you, Nan Ya.

273
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,340
You are welcome.

274
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,180
Thank you, Nan Ya.

275
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,020
Bye-bye, Wanwan.

276
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,580
Bye-bye.

277
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,660
Bye-bye, Wanwan.

278
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Bye-bye.

279
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,420
Why did you come here this late?

280
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,580
I'm worried.

281
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,620
I don't want you to get upset.

282
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,020
Why would I be upset?

283
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,060
About what Zhang Qingli said earlier.

284
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,460
She was too harsh.

285
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,340
She is actually a nice person.

286
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm worried that you...

287
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,860
Did you rush here just
to explain for her?

288
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,110
What's so funny?

289
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,340
Are you jealous?

290
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,900
Nonsense.

291
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,940
Don't go.

292
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,140
Zhou Luo,

293
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,540
if you choose me,

294
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,140
your life will become difficult.

295
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,340
Besides, I'm not as good as you imagine.

296
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,300
I have never planned

297
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,780
to choose an easy path.

298
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,140
If you want the difficult one,

299
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,340
go to someone else.

300
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,780
Have you ever thought

301
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,860
that maybe we are

302
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,540
two souls in love,

303
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,340
but with some years between us?

304
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,140
Maybe

305
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm Zhou Luo who traveled back here
from a few years in the future.

306
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
It's just that I'm in a young body.

307
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,660
Stop fantasizing.

308
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,300
This is the reality.

309
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,860
The reality is defined by humans.

310
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,220
Do you know?

311
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,060
A fundamental concept in physics states

312
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,820
that time can be distorted.

313
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
When it is high up, close to the sun,

314
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,740
it moves faster.

315
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,780
While near the ground,

316
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,020
it moves slower.

317
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
I didn't make this up.

318
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,260
It was Einstein's theory.

319
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,540
So?

320
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,460
So, time isn't as scary

321
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,900
as you think.

322
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,100
So...

323
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,780
So I hope

324
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,420
I could experience more vicissitudes,

325
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,940
setbacks,

326
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,980
and hardships in life

327
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,900
to help me grow up

328
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,820
and catch up with you sooner.

329
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Actually,

330
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,860
after all that talk,

331
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,660
I'm feeling a little hungry.

332
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,980
Could you make me a bowl of noodles?

333
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,580
Tell your families

334
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,140
that we're celebrating
Zhou Luo's birthday next week.

335
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,620
I never celebrate birthdays.

336
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,540
That won't do.

337
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,340
When you go to Beijing,

338
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,060
it'll be hard for us
to see each other.

339
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,580
We must throw you a big party this year.

340
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,780
Right, Bingbing?

341
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,580
That's right.

342
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,740
After your birthday,
you'll go to Beijing for school.

343
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
We have to hold a big party.

344
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,940
How about we go to the lakeside
for a bonfire barbecue?

345
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,620
Good idea.

346
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,980
My dad brought home
a set of tents last month.

347
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,060
We can go camping by the lake.

348
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,500
Yes! Camping sounds great.

349
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,740
I've never gone camping before.

350
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,220
Camping could be fun,

351
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,900
but I think your dad won't
let you join, Qingli.

352
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,180
It's okay. We'll just say

353
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,500
it's for Zhou Luo's birthday,
and her dad will be fine with it.

354
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,860
Maybe we should forget about it.

355
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,620
Qingli's dad is strict.

356
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,900
Stop putting her in a difficult spot.

357
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,100
Let's just have a simple dinner together

358
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,220
and go home.

359
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,420
What's a birthday party
without an all-nighter?

360
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,020
Weren't you born at midnight?

361
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,860
I have the retest
for Jinghua next month. I need to study.

362
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,130
With your IQ,

363
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,500
even if you waste some time
having fun with us, you will pass it.

364
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,580
We'll talk about it later.

365
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,470
[Zijin]

366
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,700
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my shop?

367
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,540
I am above board to come here this time.

368
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,780
The fabrics you ordered have arrived.

369
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,420
My mom asked me to bring them to you.

370
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,500
You're busy studying now.

371
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,980
You shouldn't have time
to deliver fabrics.

372
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,540
I could have picked them up myself.

373
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,260
Why did you make so many of these?

374
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Didn't you say I could
sell these for money?

375
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,020
So I want to make some
and see if I could sell them for money.

376
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,620
But didn't you say you were
only making them for Wanwan?

377
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,940
Well, circumstances have changed.

378
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,260
I need to feed her first.

379
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,780
I almost forgot.

380
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,060
When I went to stock up,

381
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,500
I picked out a few clothes for Guixiang.

382
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,780
You will give them to her.

383
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,900
You must be mistaken.

384
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,260
How come there are only gifts
for my mom?

385
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,740
It's my birthday next week.

386
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,940
Your birthday is coming?

387
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,540
Yes, it's my birthday.

388
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,340
I'll wish you a happy birthday
in advance, then.

389
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,300
What about my birthday gift?

390
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Who would cheekily ask someone

391
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,700
for gifts?

392
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,660
It's okay
that I won't have a birthday gift,

393
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,500
but I have a small wish.

394
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,860
Well,

395
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,020
can you wait for me

396
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,220
on the bridge in town

397
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,980
after midnight on that day?

398
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,220
That's not appropriate.

399
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,200
There won't be anyone else there.

400
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,780
Even so, it's still not okay.

401
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,740
Well... After my birthday,

402
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,220
I'm leaving for Beijing the next day.

403
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,980
I have an interview for Jinghua.

404
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,340
It's really important to me.

405
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
It's settled, then.

406
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,740
What's settled?

407
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,340
Inside there was a little goat,

408
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,180
and it saw a rabbit.

409
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,340
It said, "What kind of animal is this?

410
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,060
Why are its ears so long?"

411
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,300
And then?

412
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,540
And then, the rabbit said,

413
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,860
"You are the one who has long ears.

414
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,620
I'm a rabbit."

415
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,020
What happened next
between the goat and the little rabbit?

416
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,940
And the goat said,

417
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,340
"My name is Little Goat."

418
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,020
Wanwan, go into your room.

419
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,140
Stay here

420
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,260
and play by yourself for a while, okay?

421
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,540
These photos look nice.

422
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,060
Who took them for you?

423
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,660
What photos?

424
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,900
Someone on the street took them for me.

425
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,180
Nan Ya,

426
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,340
do we have

427
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,580
to be so confrontational
every time we meet?

428
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,260
Can't we just talk calmly?

429
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,340
What are you here for today?

430
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,420
The bridge case has me at my wit's end.

431
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,660
We're family,

432
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,900
so you have to help me.

433
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,580
You took all my money.

434
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,660
Now I'm owed huge medical bills.

435
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,060
You don't even care
about your daughter's illness anymore.

436
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,340
And now you're telling me we're family?

437
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,620
I was left with no other choice.

438
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,580
You brought this upon yourself.

439
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,140
If you hadn't exploited an advantage,

440
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,660
you wouldn't be in this mess.

441
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,180
Nan Ya,

442
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,860
I'm not here to argue with you today.

443
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,580
We're not arguing, right?

444
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,220
You're right to say
I brought this upon myself.

445
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,780
I admit that I made a mistake.

446
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,540
But you really have
to help me out this time.

447
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,660
And it's not that complicated for you,

448
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,420
just a small favor.

449
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,100
If it were just a small favor,

450
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,740
you wouldn't be kneeling here
and begging me like this.

451
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,460
It really is.

452
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,340
I promise.

453
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,860
Fine.

454
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,620
Sign the divorce papers first.

455
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,500
Okay, I'll sign them.

456
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,900
I've signed them.

457
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Give me your ID card.

458
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,460
Why do you need my ID card?

459
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,980
I need to use your ID card
to register a company.

460
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,900
That way, I can transfer money
through that company.

461
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,660
You want me to help you launder money?

462
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,260
What are you thinking?

463
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,660
Have you thought about who will
take care of Wanwan if things go wrong?

464
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,900
Nan Ya...

465
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,020
Nothing will go wrong.

466
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,620
And that money isn't dirty.

467
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,380
Are you living in a dream?

468
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,540
Two people died, and three people
were critically injured.

469
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,580
The investigative team is already on it.

470
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,620
It's impossible you can cover this up.

471
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,740
I advise you
to turn yourself in as soon as possible.

472
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,380
Shut up!

473
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,100
You unfaithful wench!

474
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,660
How dare you to bring up that matter!

475
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,860
Hand over the divorce papers!

476
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,180
Mom.

477
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,380
You said

478
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,180
that the police would come
to save us if we called 110, right?

479
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,500
We were just playing around. I'm fine.

480
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,620
You want the divorce papers, right?

481
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,100
Exchange them with your ID card.

482
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
Everything's fine.

483
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,740
Don't be afraid, okay?

484
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,160
Birdie.

485
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,660
What's wrong, birdie?

486
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,700
Fly, fly.

487
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,300
Fly.

488
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Fly.

489
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,980
Mom, look. Birdie flew away.

490
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,260
Bingbing!

491
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,300
Bingbing, where did you put your camera?

492
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,620
It's in there. Look for it.

493
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,980
I've been looking for it,
but it's nowhere to be found.

494
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,540
Oh, I found it.

495
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,060
It's a little damp.

496
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,100
Hold on...

497
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,740
Light the candles.
I'll take photos for you.

498
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,300
Okay.

499
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,020
Do you know how to use it?

500
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,540
Yes...

501
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,580
Make us look nice.

502
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,540
Here we go.
Three, two... Bingbing!

503
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,260
One.

504
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,460
Look at the camera.

505
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,420
Here. One more...

506
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,340
I'm lighting candles.

507
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,780
Why are you taking so many photos?

508
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,540
I think it's enough.

509
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,660
Let's light the candles first.

510
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,420
♪Happy birthday to you♪

511
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,180
Close your eyes and make a wish.

512
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,900
♪Happy birthday to you♪

513
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,540
♪Happy birthday to you♪

514
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,260
Sorry.

515
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,500
I'm late.

516
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,620
Are you cold?

517
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,660
Not at all.

518
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,180
What is this?

519
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,260
I prepared this.

520
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,340
Happy birthday.

521
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,980
Blow out the candles for me.

522
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,220
It's your birthday.
How can I blow out the candles?

523
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,220
You haven't made a wish yet.

524
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,500
I wish you could

525
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,660
get reacquainted with me
with the mindset

526
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,820
of the 19-year-old Nan Ya.

527
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,660
That's impossible.

528
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,540
Let me make another wish, then.

529
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,780
I hope I can walk hand in hand

530
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,300
with Nan Ya openly on the street.

531
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,740
You know that's not possible.

532
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,860
I will work hard to make it happen.

533
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,420
I'll do my very best

534
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,260
to make all the good things happen.

535
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,820
Nan Ya.

536
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,900
Do you believe I'll get
the special admission of Jinghua?

537
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,700
I do.

538
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,220
Do you believe I can take you away?

539
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,100
Nan Ya.

540
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,700
I plan to give up studying physics

541
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,820
and apply for computer science.

542
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,740
The future belongs to the Internet.

543
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,140
After getting into university,

544
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,620
I'll study hard.

545
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,380
I can also do part-time jobs.

546
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,260
That way, I can definitely feed Wanwan.

547
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,100
After graduation,

548
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,820
I'll find

549
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,460
a high-paying job in Beijing.

550
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,380
I'm not afraid of hardships. I mean it.

551
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,900
I just want you to be by my side.

552
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,900
I don't expect you to accept me.

553
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,740
I just hope

554
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,020
to help you get out of all this.

555
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm aware

556
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,740
you'll face more worldly tests

557
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
and criticisms,

558
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,620
but we're not wrong.

559
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,620
It's just the timing that's wrong.

560
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,180
Happy birthday.

561
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,020
Well...

562
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,980
Did you make this yourself?

563
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,420
Why did you embroider this on it?

564
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,140
I was worried others would know
it was handmade,

565
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,020
so I embroidered a label.

566
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,860
I'm going

567
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,300
to wear it all the time.

568
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,180
Actually, one of my wishes

569
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,100
has already come true today.

570
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,260
Those words I just said

571
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,380
were for her.

572
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,620
There's a place I want to show you.

573
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,820
Didn't you say you wanted
to meet 19-year-old Nan Ya?

574
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,460
This is where she tried

575
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,980
to kill herself back then.

576
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,770
[Diving is prohibited]

577
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,260
You rascal!

578
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,780
You froze...

579
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,780
You froze your dad to death on purpose!

580
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,100
I'd kill him if I were you!

581
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,060
This is your fate.

582
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,580
Accept it.

583
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,900
Mom,

584
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,940
what did I do wrong?

585
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,060
Do I not deserve to be happy

586
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,420
and loved?

587
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,500
You were the only one in this world
who really loved me,

588
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,140
but even you left me early.

589
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,780
Why do I have to live
in the dark corner?

590
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,540
Why do I have to be surrounded
by all the filthy, ugly,

591
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,820
and vile people and things?

592
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,980
You wench!

593
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,260
What are you trying to do?

594
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,900
I'm going to burn it!

595
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,060
I want to travel back
to that year right now.

596
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,620
I want to hold her tightly in my arms

597
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,300
and tell her

598
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
that I will make up

599
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,260
for all the sufferings
she's been through.

600
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,180
I want to travel back
to that year right now.

601
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,540
I want to hold her tightly in my arms

602
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,180
and tell her

603
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,300
that I will make up

604
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,180
for all the hurt she's been through.

605
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
I want to hold her tightly in my arms

606
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
and tell her

607
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,220
that I will make up

608
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,820
for all the sufferings
she's been through.

609
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,300
I will make up

610
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,100
for all the sufferings
she's been through.

611
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,540
All the sufferings
she's been through.
