00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 18]

2
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
Because he likes me.

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,510
I'm his girlfriend.

4
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,120
But it seems neither of them
knew about this.

5
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,430
Yes,

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,760
they didn't.

7
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,510
Because we agreed

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
not to tell anyone about this.

9
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,840
What?

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,710
I will cut the power.

11
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,680
This is just nothing.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,360
Even an important day
like Millennium Night...

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,080
Liu Xun,

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,430
open the door.

15
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,910
Did you have to keep this a secret?

16
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,870
Yes.

17
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,680
Why?

18
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,550
[Tender Light]

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,430
Liu Xun,

20
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,800
this isn't over!

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,710
Scoundrel, stand right there!

22
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,750
Jerk!

23
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
Give it to me.

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Get back to your classrooms.

25
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,400
Go back to your classrooms.

26
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,870
Back to your classrooms.

27
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,870
It's done.

28
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,120
Let's go downstairs.

29
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,430
Come on.

30
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,030
Let's go.

31
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,590
It's all right now.

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
What are you looking at?

33
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,910
Look away.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,960
Go away.

35
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,000
Go.

36
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,280
Go.

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,630
Liu Xun is a real rat!

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,430
He is a prick!

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Now, the entire school knows.

40
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll settle accounts with him.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
Zhou Luo.

42
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
Zhou Luo, don't go.

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,030
He... He is insane.

44
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,560
It wouldn't help
even if you beat him up.

45
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,830
Yeah, if you go now,

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,390
you will play into his hands.

47
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,070
Let's go back to the classroom first.

48
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,510
Let's go.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,040
Stop crying.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,630
Let's go.

51
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,510
Let's go.

52
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,510
Go.

53
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,510
Don't ever think I won't expel you

54
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,190
because your dad has died.

55
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,800
The whole school is in a mess
because of you.

56
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,920
What exactly are you up to?

57
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,070
Except for Xu Yi,

58
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,240
no ones owe you anything.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Just why did you pick on Zhou Luo?

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,750
His grades are better than yours,

61
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,310
but he isn't in your way.

62
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,240
Listen,

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,190
even without Zhou Luo,

64
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,800
you couldn't get into Jinghua.

65
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,120
Now go back home.

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,310
You are suspended.
Write a reflective report.

67
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,310
Tomorrow morning,

68
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,630
all classes will stop.

69
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,160
And you read it out loud

70
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,430
in front of the whole school.

71
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,310
If you fail to do so,

72
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,630
you'll be expelled!

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,830
Mr. Zhang,

74
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,630
calm down.

75
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,510
What concerns you is

76
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,510
that your daughter's
reputation is ruined, right?

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
The thing is,

78
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,830
she ruined

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,390
her own reputation.

80
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
It has nothing to do with me.

81
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,630
Mr. Zhang,

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,720
it turns out you have
been kept in the dark.

83
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,360
The tape records

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,950
what your daughter
told Officer Lin herself.

85
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,510
If you don't believe it,

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,040
go ask the police

87
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,390
for the truth.

88
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,040
Is this the police station?

89
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm Zhang Huashan.

90
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,510
I would like to talk

91
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,950
to Officer Lin.

92
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,600
Objectively speaking,

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,870
Zhou Luo is an excellent student.

94
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,390
But that being said,
I won't agree with him

95
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,950
dating my daughter.

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,190
As a student,

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360
I like him, of course.

98
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,190
But he is too smart,

99
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,600
which makes him likely
to be on the wrong track.

100
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,560
My daughter is not that mature.

101
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,190
There are many things

102
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,720
she doesn't know.

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
Regarding Nan Ya,

104
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,630
I won't judge.

105
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,680
I support Zhou Luo

106
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,190
in making friends
with my daughter and the rest students.

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,390
After all, Zhou Luo is a good student.

108
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,560
They can encourage each other.

109
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,070
But speaking of love relationships,

110
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,310
it won't happen.

111
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,870
I went to look for her

112
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,190
that night

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,560
but didn't find her.

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,160
But when we got home,

115
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,190
she had already gone to bed.

116
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,560
Zhang Qingli is tight with Nan Ya?

117
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
No, that's impossible.

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,630
They can't be related by any means.

119
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,830
She runs a fashion store,

120
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,160
and it's normal for girls

121
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,390
to visit her store.

122
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,070
Our school is just a cram school.

123
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,070
It's different
from proper high schools.

124
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,800
We don't take responsibility

125
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
for what students do

126
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,950
outside the school.

127
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,160
To put it plainly,

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,950
they are all grown-ups,

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
right?

130
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,750
Cupric oxide and carbon

131
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,800
generate copper and carbon dioxide

132
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,310
under high temperatures.

133
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,630
In this equation,

134
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,750
cupric oxide acts
as the oxidizing agent,

135
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,310
while the carbon

136
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,390
acts as the reducing agent.

137
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,000
Sir.

138
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
Who are you looking for?

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Sir,

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Zhang Qingli's mom called

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
to ask her to go home.

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,270
All right, got it.

143
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,830
Zhang Qingli,

144
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,560
something came up at your home.

145
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,720
Your mom asked you

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
to head back now.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,240
Speaking of carbon,

148
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,040
we mentioned cupric oxide

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
is the oxidizing agent,

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,950
while carbon

151
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,920
is the reducing agent

152
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,070
in this equation.

153
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,750
She had this coming.

154
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,830
On this side, it generates
the product of the reduction

155
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,630
and oxidation.

156
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,270
Learn this reaction equation by heart.

157
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,550
On this side,

158
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,630
we can see

159
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,150
the reduction-oxidation reaction.

160
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,080
It includes hydrogen...

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,120
Zhang Qingli's mom found it out.

162
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
oxygen,

163
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,960
and neon.

164
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,550
What are you discussing?

165
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,320
I didn't start any rumors.

166
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,120
You all see that.

167
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,670
Some people

168
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,440
are born sanctimonious.

169
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,150
But privately...

170
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,030
Zhou Luo!

171
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,510
I'm warning you,
come at me if you can.

172
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,790
Don't hurt the innocents!

173
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,150
Zhou Luo!

174
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,440
Get up.

175
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,510
Zhou Luo!

176
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,030
Stop fighting!

177
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,000
Stop pretending!

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,390
Liu Xun.

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,840
You hypocrite!

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Get down!

181
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,550
Back to your seats!

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,870
Sit back down!

183
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,600
Calm down.

184
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,720
Here.

185
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,270
Hurry and drink this.

186
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,510
Qingli.

187
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,390
Tell me,

188
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,960
what did you do

189
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,120
on Millennium Night?

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,510
Did you fool around

191
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,320
with Zhou Luo?

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,960
Be nice.

193
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,720
This is my privacy.

194
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,150
Your privacy? Nonsense!

195
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,910
Tomorrow,

196
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,720
I will cross Zhou Luo's name

197
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
off Huashan's list.

198
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,510
You can't do that.

199
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,550
And he won't get into Jinghua.

200
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,550
I will also report this

201
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,720
to the Education Bureau.

202
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,790
I won't allow him

203
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,080
to get into any university!

204
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,030
If he can't get admitted

205
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,910
because of you,

206
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,240
I won't go either!

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,670
Qingli.

208
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,790
Fine.

209
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,320
Come with me.

210
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Let go of me!

211
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
Come to Zhou's place with me.

212
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
You ask him

213
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,150
if he would give up his future

214
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,550
for you.

215
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,390
Let's go!

216
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,240
Mom!

217
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,910
Go back.

218
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,790
Mom!

219
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,120
Come with me.

220
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Just leave me alone!

221
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,840
Except for me, who else cares about you?

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,720
Let go of me!

223
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,910
Do you think
that brat will care about you?

224
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,390
I have nothing to do with him.

225
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Where are you going?

226
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,840
What is going on?

227
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,870
Come.

228
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,030
Let go of me!

229
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,910
Come here.

230
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,750
You have a toothache. Don't drink it.

231
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,630
Zhou Ping!

232
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,030
Lin Guixiang!

233
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,720
Who is it?

234
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,870
Get over here.

235
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,670
Just leave me be!

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,510
Mr. Zhang?

237
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,150
Zhou Ping.

238
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,840
Lin Guixiang.

239
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,360
Come.

240
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,510
Don't pull me. I can walk myself!

241
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,840
What's going on, Qingli?

242
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,080
What's going on?

243
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,910
Zhang...

244
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,630
What's wrong?

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,360
What have you two taught

246
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,750
your son to be?

247
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,240
The university expelled him.

248
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,510
Then he came to Huashan

249
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,720
to make such a mess.

250
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,510
Today,

251
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,790
you must make this clear,

252
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,150
or you won't get away with this!

253
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,360
Zhang,

254
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
let's talk nicely.

255
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,080
Don't be mad, all right?

256
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,240
I know

257
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,080
my son's character

258
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,030
very well.

259
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,910
He is nothing but a troublemaker!

260
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,870
I was so blind!

261
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,030
Hadn't I helped him,

262
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,030
an expelled student like him

263
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,080
wouldn't have had a place
in the cram school.

264
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,630
I did everything in my power

265
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,240
to send him to Jinghua.

266
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,320
Look what he has done.

267
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,240
So ingrate.

268
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,030
He tries

269
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,270
to ruin my daughter!

270
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,960
Dad!

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,670
Mr. Zhang,

272
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,790
please don't say it like that.

273
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,440
What is going on?

274
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,030
You can't slander my son

275
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,080
without evidence.

276
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,390
Who would slander him
using their own daughter's reputation?

277
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,960
What exactly happened?

278
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Did you see something

279
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,240
or hear something?

280
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,720
Tell us.

281
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,320
Trying to deny it, huh?

282
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,390
Zhang Qingli,

283
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,390
did you hear that?

284
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,870
They don't even admit it.

285
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,200
You are like a fool

286
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
ranting at your own dad

287
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,240
for him.

288
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Fine,

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,550
since you are so cruel,

290
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,320
mark my words.

291
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I still

292
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,200
have a say

293
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,840
in the education field.

294
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,120
Zhou Luo,

295
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,000
you are on suspension
starting tomorrow.

296
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
I... I...

297
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,510
I'm going to call Jinghua

298
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,270
and report him!

299
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,030
I will report you!

300
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,440
Don't you dare!

301
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,120
Zhang...

302
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,670
I'm telling you,

303
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,960
don't you ever push me.

304
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,360
If my son can't get admitted this year,

305
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,360
no one will get admitted either.

306
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,240
All right, calm down.

307
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,440
What exactly is going on?

308
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,630
Zhang,

309
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,200
calm down.

310
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Hear me out, okay?

311
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,150
If they both

312
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,360
like each other,

313
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
then just let them be together.

314
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,030
Right?

315
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,150
Besides, my son

316
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,240
isn't inferior to your daughter.

317
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,080
How could you say
that he ruined her?

318
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,120
Why don't you ask what he did?

319
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,630
My daughter is simple

320
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,150
and naive.

321
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,200
But your son

322
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,200
has a shameless past.

323
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,600
You've gone too far.

324
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm telling you,

325
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,790
I won't allow you to demean my son.

326
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm his mother.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,360
I know him very well.

328
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,630
Zhou Luo,

329
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,750
did you...

330
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,510
What are you doing?

331
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,670
hurt my daughter?

332
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,150
Dad.

333
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,000
Did you deceive her?

334
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes!

335
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,790
Did you seduce her?

336
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,120
Yes!

337
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,550
That's why you did that?

338
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:07,720
Yes!

339
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,550
You have gone too far!

340
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,320
Let go of him!

341
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,910
Dad!

342
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,720
Yes!

343
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,150
We are in a relationship.

344
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,200
I did it voluntarily.

345
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,510
I like him.

346
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,600
He didn't deceive me

347
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,240
or seduce me.

348
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,390
I'm a grown-up.

349
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,750
I can do whatever I want.

350
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,870
So stay out of my business!

351
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,150
You...

352
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,510
Qingli,

353
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,910
what exactly happened?

354
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,750
Zhang.

355
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,840
Don't scare me.

356
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,120
Don't get so worked up, Zhang.

357
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,750
Calm down, Zhang.

358
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,600
Is there any medicine?

359
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,360
Yes.

360
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,030
Dad.

361
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,030
You see,
Chen's attitude is very sincere

362
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,150
but...

363
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,670
Come in.

364
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,790
On a personal level...

365
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,510
Chen,

366
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,200
I was about to look for you.

367
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Come in and sit.

368
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,960
Take a seat.

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
Chen,

370
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,630
I read the recusal

371
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,440
you just submitted.

372
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,000
As an experienced

373
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,150
police officer,

374
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,750
I think

375
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,320
you have overthought.

376
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,790
Actually, you didn't have to do that.

377
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,750
Although

378
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,030
Chen Ling is involved in it,

379
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,550
she has

380
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,150
nothing much to do with the case.

381
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,080
Of course,

382
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,270
you need to avoid the investigation
about the car arson.

383
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,270
But as for Nan Ya's case,

384
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,870
you have already requested a recusal
at the beginning,

385
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,150
and the authority has agreed
you can continue

386
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,360
to work in the case.

387
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,150
Sir.

388
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,790
Nan Ya and I were also schoolmates.

389
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,270
Lin,

390
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,030
when you first took this case,

391
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,320
you requested recusal too.

392
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
There is no connection

393
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,600
between you and the suspect.

394
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,790
The authority also reckons
you don't need to withdraw from it.

395
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,270
People in this town

396
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
are either schoolmates or neighbors.

397
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,750
It's been years since you left school.

398
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,870
And you have never
been in touch with her.

399
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,750
Plus, you are not her relative.

400
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,960
So just proceed with your work
boldly and without worries.

401
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,840
Chen,

402
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,270
don't overthink.

403
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,000
All the police here

404
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,550
are in this special task force.

405
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,390
Besides,

406
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,270
you guys cracked

407
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,720
Hu Lifan's and Liu Changshui's cases.

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,600
Everyone knows and remembers

409
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,670
what you guys

410
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,630
have done so far.

411
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,080
We are pretty satisfied.

412
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,600
Qingshui Town

413
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,510
is just this big,

414
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,510
and we see each other every day.

415
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,030
I'm afraid

416
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,000
that things get complicated

417
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,440
even if we are in the right.

418
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,790
What do you mean?

419
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,840
What people say

420
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,550
or their opinions

421
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,630
don't matter to us.

422
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,790
As long as we do our duties

423
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,320
professionally and justly.

424
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,240
Besides,

425
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,360
I'm supervising you.

426
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,120
Our police force

427
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,550
is always short of manpower.

428
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,960
You two are the only ones
with experience.

429
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,600
So you have to work closely together.

430
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,150
How about this?

431
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,960
Before the superiors reply to us

432
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,000
and allocate more staff,

433
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,870
Lin

434
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,200
will take charge of the case.

435
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,840
You will assist him for now.

436
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Lin,

437
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,870
we are counting on you.

438
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,790
All right.

439
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,440
Are you cold, my daughter?

440
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,150
Ling,

441
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,510
on the night Xu Yi died,

442
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,750
where were you?

443
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,750
On the night shift.

444
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,080
From when to when?

445
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,030
Are you interrogating me?

446
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,200
Do you have the schedule?

447
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,790
What do you mean?

448
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,720
Is there anything else

449
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,270
you haven't dug up from me
to make a merit?

450
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,510
Just be frank with me.

451
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,790
Anyway, everyone is gossiping about me.

452
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,880
Is this how you talk to your father?

453
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,400
Are you visiting your daughter,

454
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,200
or are you interrogating a suspect?

455
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,440
Look what kind of life I'm living.

456
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,790
You brought it on yourself.

457
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,160
Ling.

458
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,240
Stop right there.

459
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,030
There's nothing else.

460
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I just want to ask you

461
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,790
whether or not Xu Yi's case

462
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,550
has anything to do with you.

463
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,830
Yes,

464
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,030
I stabbed him twice.

465
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Do you have the cuffs with you?

466
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,750
Arrest me.

467
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,790
No?

468
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,440
Then, I'm going back to work.

469
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,790
Actually, I think Ling and Dr. Jiang

470
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,070
would make a good couple.

471
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,920
Why doesn't Ling accept him?

472
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,680
I agree.

473
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,270
Dr. Jiang is quite humorous.

474
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,830
He's not like what Ling described.

475
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,590
That's right.

476
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,960
Dr. Jiang always
brings us delicious food.

477
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,960
Do you think

478
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,000
Ling is playing hard to get?

479
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,720
What are you talking about?

480
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,270
It's work time now.

481
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,440
Get out if you don't want to work!

482
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,110
What is this?

483
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,240
Who put it here?

Who put it here?

485
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,270
Did you hear me? Who put it here?

486
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,070
Ling,

487
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,880
Dr. Jiang bought it.

488
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,680
I told you

489
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
I have nothing to do with him!

490
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,720
From now on,

491
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,030
throw out everything he brings!

What's going on?

Ling,

496
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,240
Dr. Jiang bought it
for the director

00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,310
We can't even help ourselves now.

577
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,310
No one stands up for us.

578
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,720
Here.

579
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,440
Drink some tea.

580
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,400
Guixiang,

581
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,000
is there anyone threatening you?

582
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,750
No.

583
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,190
Says who?

584
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,920
The Xu family

585
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,270
and the Liu family

586
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,750
are difficult to deal with.

587
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,350
Zhou Luo got suspended now.

588
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,000
The college entrance exam
is approaching.

589
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,790
If anything

590
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,440
goes wrong,

591
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,030
who

592
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,720
can we turn to?

593
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,510
Guixiang,

594
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
regarding his suspension,

595
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,350
you should talk to Zhang Huashan.

596
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,830
It has nothing to do with testifying.

597
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,680
How could you say this?

598
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,270
Why did Liu Xun

599
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,030
cause such a trouble?

600
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Then, why was he suspended?

601
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,110
Well,

602
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,640
let me ask you.

603
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,880
If we hadn't reported the case,

604
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,640
no one would've known
that Zhou Luo witnessed the scene.

605
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,510
The officer is staying at my house

606
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,640
and keeping an eye on Zhou Luo

607
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
as if he were a thief.

608
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,110
Horrible rumors are spreading

609
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,400
in the school,

610
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,440
yet you ignore them

611
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,920
and say something like this.

612
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
I roughly know

613
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,680
about Zhou Luo's suspension.

614
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,350
Someone

615
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,680
must be lying.

616
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,750
She must be lying.

617
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Zhou Luo

618
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,590
wouldn't do that.

619
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,590
Qingli.

620
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,510
Get in the car.

621
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,550
Where are we going?

622
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:53,960
I'm not going.

623
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,880
Come with us.

624
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
I won't go.

625
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
Get in. Come on.

626
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,270
Pull her in.

627
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,960
Quickly.

628
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,790
I'm not going.

629
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,350
Get in the car.

630
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,160
Get in.

631
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,510
Let's go.

632
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,790
Why are you running away?

633
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,590
Do you know how much effort we made

634
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,830
to arrange this appointment?

635
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,270
It's a simple checkup.

636
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,720
Just go for the checkup.

637
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,350
Stop right there!

638
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,960
Why should I go for the checkup?

639
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
You know it very well.

640
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,440
I don't need the checkup.

641
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,920
I decide

642
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,070
whether you need it or not.

643
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm already a grown-up.

644
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,510
If you force me to do the checkup,

645
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,440
I can sue you in court.

646
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,400
What are you talking about?

647
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,510
Go ahead and sue me.

648
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
You beat me?

649
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,750
You can scold me as you like

650
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,920
after the checkup.

651
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,160
Listen,

652
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,110
even if you beat me to death here,

653
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,160
I won't do it.

654
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,240
If Zhou Luo can't return to school,

655
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,590
I will also quit!

656
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,160
If Zhou Luo can't take the exam,

657
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
I'm not going to answer the papers.

658
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
What are you saying?

659
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,310
Do you have no shame?

660
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,270
If you can't pass the exam,

661
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,510
you will repeat another year.

662
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,720
I run a cram school.

663
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
I will ask you to repeat ten more years.

664
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,640
Let's see if you can take it or not.

665
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,960
In your dream!

666
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,920
Qingli.

667
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
Don't run, Qingli!

668
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,680
Qingli!

669
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,510
My son has excellent grades.

670
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Why is it so hard for him
to get into a university?

671
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,240
Let's withdraw from testifying.

672
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,510
Troubles keep coming to us

673
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
for no reason.

674
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,880
Now, we've pissed Zhang Huashan off.

675
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,160
Can you not miss the point?

676
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,270
The college entrance exam

677
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,750
is coming soon in just a few months.

678
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,030
If he really means to hinder Zhou Luo,

679
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,830
Zhou Luo won't be able
to take the exam.

680
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,640
I really don't get

681
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,160
what Qingli is up to.

682
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,960
Jeez.

683
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,550
Where did you go

684
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,030
that night?

685
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,350
I was at home.

686
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,960
What about Zhang Qingli?

687
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,110
Did something happen

688
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,640
between you two

689
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
like she said?

690
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
Dad, Mom.

691
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,270
Don't worry about me.

692
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,310
I didn't do anything wrong

693
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,640
or bad.

694
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,070
I can live well

695
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,270
no matter what.

696
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,510
I will strive to get into university.

697
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,510
But if I can't,

698
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,510
I'm fine with it.

699
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,030
Anyway,

700
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,110
I will live my life well.

701
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,830
I want you to take the best path.

702
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,880
Mom, there isn't any best path,

703
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
only choice.

704
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,590
Who could it be? It's late now.

705
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,350
Hello?

706
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,270
May I speak to Zhou Luo?

707
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,720
Who is speaking?

708
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,240
Luo.

709
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,270
Luo.

710
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,030
Her surname is Yang.

711
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,270
She said she was your teacher.

712
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,790
Zhou Luo.

713
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,200
Ms. Yang.

714
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,160
I heard

715
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
that you are in trouble.

716
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,030
It's okay. I can manage.

717
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,400
A police officer called Lin Fanglu

718
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,750
called me before.

719
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,880
Are there any complicated reasons
behind this?

720
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200
No.

721
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,160
Did anyone read

722
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,750
the letter I sent you?

723
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,720
Someone used your name
to chat with me,

724
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,920
trying to fish for information from me.

725
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,920
Do you know who this person is?

726
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,590
I do.

727
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,030
Is it the same person who exposed you?

728
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,590
Why did he do that?

729
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,110
No idea.

730
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,310
Zhou Luo,

731
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,110
I have always felt guilty
about your dropout.

732
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,680
I have reflected on it
for a long time.

733
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,000
I should've kept

734
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,440
a proper distance from you.

735
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,310
I failed to protect you.

736
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,400
That's why there were so many rumors.

737
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,030
Ms. Yang, please stop.

738
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,200
It's all in the past.

739
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,830
Zhou Luo,

740
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,960
what I'm telling you is very important.

741
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,350
Let me finish.

742
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,110
I used to think my innocence
would speak for itself,

743
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,510
so I didn't bother to explain
or clarify anything.

744
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,350
Consequently,

745
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,030
the situation got out of control.

746
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,920
I underestimated how seriously
the incident could develop.

747
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,880
Also, I failed to advise you
to cut your losses in time,

748
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
and that led to a drastic change

749
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,350
in your life.

750
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,790
In the short term,
the change was you quit school.

751
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,030
But in the long term,
everything you are facing

752
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,160
could all have been avoided.

753
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,680
The Butterfly Effect.

754
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,550
I don't know whether or not
it would affect

755
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,030
your future.

756
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,790
I'm doing quite well now.

757
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,880
It's not that serious.

758
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,640
I want to make up for my mistake.

759
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,640
I can be at ease

760
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,790
only if you successfully
get into university.

761
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,640
Let me tell you.

762
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,750
I know my own son

763
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,070
the best.

764
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:23,680
He would never do that

765
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,200
with Qingli.

766
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,880
Don't expect

767
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,680
we can be spared

768
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,000
from worrying about our child.

769
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,440
Even though we don't have
to worry about his studies,

770
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,880
there might be worries

771
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,240
when it comes to other aspects.

772
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,160
It's all in the past.

773
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
Besides, I don't regret

774
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,790
what I did at that time.

775
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,550
Zhou Luo,

776
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,200
don't be complacent

777
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,590
because you are the top student
in Qingshui Town.

778
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,110
There are many smart students like you

779
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,200
in prestigious schools
here and overseas.

780
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,070
While you are wasting your youth,

781
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,960
others are striving hard.

782
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,070
I know the college entrance exam
isn't difficult for you.

783
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,680
But you shouldn't waste your time

784
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
on meaningless things.

785
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,880
You have a good prospect.

786
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,750
Don't always think you are still young.

787
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,790
Time slips by in the blink of an eye.

788
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,350
I know.

789
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,200
Now, I just want

790
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,200
to get into university
without worries.

791
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,070
Is that so?

792
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,720
Then how did you end up
with all these messes?

793
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,110
You are the only witness

794
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,550
in a murder case.

795
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,310
And that rival of yours in the school.

796
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,720
Is all this not messy enough?

797
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,880
You said you wanted to switch

798
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,350
to computer science.

799
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,790
Why?

800
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm interested in that.

801
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,310
The Internet

802
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,350
is the future for sure.

803
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,440
I want to be part of that era.

804
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,830
That's not your real reason.

805
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,680
Your passion for physics

806
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,510
won't change just like this, Zhou Luo.

807
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,640
I want to make money.

808
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,070
Since when have you become so realistic?

809
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,510
Zhou Luo,

810
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,790
your life can't afford
too many mistakes.

811
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,960
You have to take control
of your future.

812
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,720
Madam Guixiang,

813
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,030
is Zhou Luo in?

814
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,590
I want to see him.

815
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,550
You have some nerve coming here.

816
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,790
He's not in!

817
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,160
Madam Guixiang...

818
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,550
What are you doing?

819
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,720
I'm sorry.

820
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,680
What's the use of apologizing to me?

821
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,400
Let go!

822
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,790
I'm sorry, Madam Guixiang.

823
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,680
I want to talk to Zhou Luo.

824
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,070
I have to see him.

825
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,110
Listen up,

826
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,790
I won't allow you to see him anymore.

827
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,750
Leave!

828
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,350
I'm sorry, Madam Guixiang.

829
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,240
Fine.

830
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,160
Don't cry.

831
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,830
Tell me

832
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,400
what happened

833
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
that night.

834
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,240
I can't tell you.

835
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,680
You can't tell me?

836
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,510
But you can spew nonsense

837
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,750
to other people, huh?

838
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,110
I never wanted this.

839
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,750
Really, Madam Guixiang.

840
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm sorry.

841
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,640
You have done enough harm to Luo.

842
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,920
He is suspended now.

843
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,030
I'm telling you,

844
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,030
if he can't

845
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,960
get into Jinghua,

846
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,880
I will never forgive you.

847
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,440
Crying in my face?

848
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,070
Enough.

849
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,680
I used

850
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,510
to like you.

851
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,350
It's perfect now.

852
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,160
Your dad doesn't like Zhou Luo anyway.

853
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,550
From now on, you are not allowed
to step foot in my house

854
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,510
or meet Zhou Luo ever again.

855
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,240
Go!

856
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,000
No, Madam Guixiang.

857
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,270
Leave right now.

858
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,590
Go home.

859
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,830
Go home.

860
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,510
Go!

861
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,510
Madam Guixiang,

862
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,590
I told my dad

863
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,150
if he doesn't allow Zhou Luo
to return to school,

864
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,280
I will quit too!

865
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,590
Mom.

866
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,110
I want to talk to Zhang Qingli.

867
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,230
You... Luo...

868
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,360
Mom, it's fine.

869
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,190
Qingli.

870
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,590
Don't worry.

871
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,320
Zhou Luo.

872
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Zhou Luo, I'm so sorry.

873
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,190
I was too reckless and childish.

874
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,230
I really wanted to help.

875
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,400
Here, have some water.

876
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,360
No.

877
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,070
Qingli,

878
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,510
I'm to blame, actually.

879
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,360
If Liu Xun hadn't insisted
on picking on me,

880
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
he wouldn't have gotten you involved

881
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,190
and brought such a shame

882
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,400
to you.

883
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,110
So the one who should apologize is me.

884
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,510
I'm sorry.

885
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,590
No, Zhou Luo.

886
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,230
My dad has gone too far!

887
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,630
Your dad just wants
to protect his daughter.

888
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,590
He didn't do anything wrong.

889
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,150
But he wants to expel you.

890
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,510
You went through so much to...

891
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,190
Qingli,

892
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Jinghua's lowering the cut-off

893
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
doesn't really mean much to me.

894
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,150
Even if I can't return to Huashan,

895
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,630
I can attend another cram school.

896
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,400
On top of that,

897
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,760
even if I can't get into Jinghua,

898
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,190
I can choose other universities.

899
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,510
But I started all this.

900
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
I can't let you

901
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,280
endure such humiliation alone.

902
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,510
I will explain this
to Mr. Zhang and the police.

903
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,070
Don't go, Zhou Luo!

904
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,000
Zhou Luo,

905
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,150
let me bear this myself.

906
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,760
When everything is over,

907
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,070
let's go to Beijing

908
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,960
and leave all this behind.

909
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,760
I don't care how they think about me

910
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,960
or judge me.

911
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,000
I just want to be with you!

912
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,710
I just want to be with you!

913
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,960
Qingli, listen to me.

914
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,280
You don't have to bear it.

915
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,550
Don't worry.

916
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,030
I will find a way.

917
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,400
Don't you have a polygraph?

918
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,320
I always see it in movies.

919
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,030
When someone takes it,

920
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,070
you can observe his ECG
to see if he is lying.

921
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,710
Why don't you test me?

922
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,510
I have told you truthfully

923
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,590
everything I saw.

924
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,510
If you still doubt me,

925
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,670
what can I do?

926
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,190
What did I feel
when I witnessed the murder?

927
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,510
My scalp tingled.

928
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,440
I heard ringing in my ears.

929
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,510
As if my feet were nailed to the ground,

930
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,710
I couldn't walk

931
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,320
or run.

932
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,630
My heart was pounding fast.

933
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,440
I have no opinion on this incident.

934
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,030
I'm just stating the facts.

935
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,510
Mutual understanding,

936
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,760
common interests,

937
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,920
being able to confide in each other,

938
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,670
and admiring or liking each other.

939
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,440
At least one of these
needs to be fulfilled

940
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,000
to befriend someone, right?

941
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,510
That's why we are not friends.
