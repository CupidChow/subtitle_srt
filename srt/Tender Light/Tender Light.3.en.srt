00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,060
Why are you following me?

4
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,660
I...

5
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,260
I'm not following you.

6
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,060
Why don't you admit that?

7
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,620
Admit what?

00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,460
I'll have a tofu.

10
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,180
I want more pickled mustard in mine!

11
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,060
Sure thing.

12
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,260
That Xu Yi...

13
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,860
He doesn't have a motive

14
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,860
for killing Nan Ya.

15
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,620
I know a thing or two
about the bridge case.

16
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,900
It wasn't serious enough
to commit murder.

17
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,540
On the contrary, Nan Ya had been
suffered from abuse

18
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,660
and wanted to divorce him.

19
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,780
She hated him.

20
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,460
So she killed him.

21
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,340
Could it

22
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,740
be possible?

23
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,860
Were you saying
that you are not a verbalist?

24
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,660
Talking to well-educated people like you

25
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,340
is truly...

26
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,380
truly exhausting.

27
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,100
Well,

28
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,660
this is called inference.

29
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Inference only works
when there is logic.

30
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,820
How do we solve cases?

31
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,300
Precisely by inference.

32
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,500
Maybe you are, but I'm not.

33
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,780
Then how do you solve cases?

34
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,540
By intuition?

35
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,700
No wonder people call you talent.

36
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,580
You have up-to-date skills
and fresh ideas.

37
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,580
Don't flatter me.

38
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,780
I've realized long ago

39
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,100
that I was with average talents

40
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,460
and low IQ.

41
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,140
That's why I don't believe in intuition.

42
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,380
I solve cases

43
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,260
with my self-control.

44
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,700
What?

45
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
Self-control?

46
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,820
Control myself
from involving personal feelings, biases

47
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,780
and unreliable stuff like intuition

48
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,140
in the investigation.

49
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,340
Everyone in Qingshui Town

50
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,220
knows about Xu Yi's long-term abuse.

52

Control myself from making judgments
on any one person too early.

54
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,460
I wanted a divorce

55
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,660
but Xu Yi wouldn't agree to it.

56
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,780
Xu Yi's parents
didn't like Nan Ya either.

57
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,820
They refused to formally accept her
into the family.

58
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,460
But Xu Yi...

59
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,900
He had a weird obsession with her.

60
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,700
Control myself from verifying
my own assumptions through reasoning.

61
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
Control myself and check every detail

62
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,700
until every piece of the puzzle

63
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,580
forms a closed chain of evidence.

64
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,700
The incident happened on the night
of the millennium.

65
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,220
The murder weapon was a knife.

66
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
One stab from the front,

67
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,900
and one from the back.

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,700
The stab to the chest
pierced the heart artery,

69
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,660
which almost killed him instantly.

70
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,100
The sound of fireworks
overlapped the explosion.

71
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,820
No one paid any attention at the time.

72
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,420
He came here with his parents.

73
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,260
His description of the crime scene

74
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
was basically the same as Nan Ya's.

75
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
He was relatively calm.

76
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,700
Ma'am, how much is it?

77
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,580
It's 6 yuan for two bowls.

78
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,500

79
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,940

The construction of the bridge started

92

in summer last year.

93
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,540

What was the main cause?

97
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,940
There was a problem
with the reinforced concrete.

98
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,540
Some parts of it are leaking.

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,340

Can you explain it to me?

104

108
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,140
I was sent by the county office

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,820
to investigate this matter.

110
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,940
Was Xu Yi the main contractor?

111
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,260
There's also a problem
with the qualifications

00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,900
of the designer and construction team.

113
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,740
It was privately designed,

114
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,540
the blueprints were not authorized,

115
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620

116
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,260
Every level of construction
was contracted out.

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,260
Although Xu Yi was the contractor,

118
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,500
he sub-contracted the project

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,100

120
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,540
If it were investigated,

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,020
would Xu Yi bear
the legal responsibility?

122
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
Hard to say.

124
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,500
was the main handler
for the construction materials.

He just ran away

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,020
So Liu Changshui doesn't work
for Shengda?

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,660
No.

139
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,060
He was hired from outside.

140
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,700
This is a major project.

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,620
Why did you guys simply hire
an outsider

to take such an important role
of procurement officer?

143
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,820
Mr. Xu saw that he was also
from Qingshui.

144

He thought he could trust
a fellow homeboy.

145

But Liu Changshui was full of greed.

In order to gain extra benefits,

147
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,940
he signed fake checks

149
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,140
As a result, the bridge collapsed
before it was completed.

150
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
He managed

151
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,100

There's no valid motive
for Xu Yi to kill Nan Ya.

He'd already sorted out the finances.

162

The ECU is also after Liu Changshui.

163
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,500
Even if he's guilty of joint liability,

164
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,740
he'd just be in jail
for two years at most.

Killing for such a reason?

166
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,420

167
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,620
still lies with the procurement officer
who's on the run.

Isn't he dead?

181
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,700

182

187
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,260

Do you know

Probably the one who gave birth to me.

373
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,940
Watch your mouth!

374
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,540
You have no manners.

375
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,340
I'm just not good at studying.

376
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,100
Okay, okay.

377
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,340
I said I didn't want to repeat a year
but you forced me to do it.

378
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,780
Right? I just want
to go to the Police Academy.

379
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,500
That's enough.

380
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
You have to be educated

381
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,060
to become a police officer.

382
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,980
If you're like this,

383
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,340
you'll never be admitted
to the Police Academy.

384
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,300
Eat, bro.

385
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,780
Bro.

386
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,780
Will what my friend saw

387
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,940
be helpful to the investigation?

388
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,820
Of course.

389
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,740
He's an eye-witness.

390
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,740
His statement is crucial.

391
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,500
So, if two people were fighting,

392
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
and one of them
stabbed the other to death,

393
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,060
how will such a case be sentenced?

394
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,020
If it was a life-threatening moment,

395
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
it could be justified as self-defense.

396
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Justified as self-defense?

397
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,460
Meaning not guilty.

398
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,780
According to the evidence
we currently have,

399
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,940
it can be regarded
as a justifiable defense.

400
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,260
I have a night shift.

401
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,020
- Ling.
- Finish dinner first.

402
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Eat first before you go.

403
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,740
Your mom can pack some food for you.

404
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,260
Okay?

405
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,820
Ling!

406
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,460
Never mind. That's how my sister is.

407
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,740
Be careful on the road.

408
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,260
She can't stand hearing
people talking about those two people.

409
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,660
It's a knot in her heart.

410
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,420
It's been so many years,

411
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,260
and yet she still can't let it go.

412
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,980
Stop talking.

413
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,060
Let me help, ma'am.

414
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,900
No need, you just go and drink some tea.

415
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,260
It's okay. I ate too much
and should do some exercise.

416
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,260
Don't mind them, Officer Lin.

417
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,500
This family is full
of stubborn people.

418
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
They're all like this.

419
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,060
But they are

420
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,660
all good and honest people.

421
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,780
Officer Lin.

422
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,660
It's been decades since what happened
to the young generation.

423
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,020
I don't mind telling you about it.

424
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,220
That Nan Ya

425
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
used to be best friends with Ling.

426
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,020
They were so close that they even wore
each other's clothes.

427
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,100
She was miserable.

428
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,020
Her mother died early.

429
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
And her father?

430
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,300
He was lazy and unreliable.

431
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,020
He was drinking all the time.

432
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,780
Her stepmother also treated her badly.

433
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,820
Whenever Ling talked about her,

434
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,460
she'd get all teary and emotional.

435
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,300
She felt bad
because nobody cared about Nan Ya.

436
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,860
Often,

437
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,220
she'd ask Nan Ya
to come over for dinner.

438
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,980
When it got late,
they'd share the small bed together.

439
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,620
We treated her like our own daughter.

440
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,100
No one could've expected

441
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
how things turned out.

442
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,500
The blame should go
to those two people

443
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,700
for being too ruthless.

444
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,820
That Nan Ya

445
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,380
is heartless.

446
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,220
You know what?

447
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,020
Whenever Nan Ya
brought her daughter here,

448
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,580
she would close the door
once they entered Dr. Jiang's office.

449
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,260
They'd be in there for a long time,
and no one knew what they were doing.

450
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,660
The following patients
had been complaining.

451
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,100
How shameless.

452
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,260
She's so brazen.

453
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,980
Chen Ling is so unlucky.

454
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,580
How does Nan Ya always manage
to steal her man?

455
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,700
Chen Ling's man?

456
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,580
Who?

457
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,500
Dr. Jiang.

458
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,980
The chief set them up for a blind date.

459
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,980
Really?

460
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,620
Nan Ya seduces every man.

461
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,980
Even Xu Yi's cousin got involved
and eloped.

462
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,220
She knows how to seduce a man well.

463
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,860
I don't suppose Chen Ling knows yet.

464
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Otherwise, I bet she'd be furious.

465
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,500
If it were me,

466
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,980
I'd have destroyed her face
when she was caught red-handed.

467
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,220
Nan Ya.

468
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,980
Open the door, Nan Ya!

469
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,180
I know you're in there.

470
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,860
Open up!

471
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,620
Nan Ya!

472
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,260
What are you doing here?

473
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,180
Let's talk outside.

474
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,260
I'm not going!

475
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,660
- Nan Ya!
- Get over here!

476
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,300
Was I not good to you?

477
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,860
Was our family not good to you?

478
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Didn't you say he wasn't a good man?

479
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,220
You even told me to...

480
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,020
Enough!

481
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,500
Nan Ya.

482
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,980
How vicious of you.

483
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,980
You deserve every bit

484
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,980
of the hardships you have suffered before

485
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,700
and the subsequent repercussions
you will receive.

486
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,420
You'll never be happy!

487
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,660
How do little chicks sound?

488
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,620
Your little ear...

489
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,620
What are you doing?

490
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,300
Mom, let me take Wanwan to the hospital.

491
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
You're kidding. Don't you go to school?

492
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,300
It's okay.

493
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,700
I have already learned

494
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,780
everything anyway.

495
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,100
Besides, I know Wanwan's condition well.

496
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,180
It's easier for me to take her there.

497
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,860
You already set up the seat?

498
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,780
Alright, then. Luo will take you there.

499
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,820
Listen.

500
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,220
When you're on the steep road,

501
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,980
go slower.

502
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,420
It's hard for her to sit at the back.

503
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,780
Okay.

504
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,300
Wanwan, hold onto this tight

505
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,500
while Luo is driving.

506
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Hold tight, okay?

507
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,220
Don't ride the bike. It's not safe.

508
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,260
I'll drive you guys there.

509
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,260
I'm heading there too.

510
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,980
In the meantime, I can find out more
about Wanwan's illness.

511
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,980
Someone is worried about her.

512
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,860
[Yishan Second People's Hospital]

513
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,660
Does it hurt here?

514
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,500
No.

515
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
How about here?

516
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,820
No.

517
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,300
Okay.

518
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,220
Did you eat seafood lately?

519
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,620
You said I couldn't eat.

520
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,900
Yes, good girl.

521
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,260
All done. Put on her coat for her.

522
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,860
How is it?

523
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,580
Same old.

524
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,620
But that's a good thing.

525
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,020
Wanwan.

526
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,780
Remember to keep warm.

527
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,980
Make sure not to catch a cold.

528
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,500
Also, pay attention to what you eat.

529
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,060
Low protein, got it?

530
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,740
Wouldn't low protein

531
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,500
cause her to be malnourished?

532
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,740
At least, it's better
than deterioration.

533
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,500
Right?

534
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,620
Plus, low protein doesn't mean
cutting it out completely.

535
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,940
Foods with high purine, like sea foods,

536
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,900
it's better not to eat them.

537
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,100
Why is it you coming with her today?

538
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,020
Mind your own business.

539
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,780
Watch your mouth.

540
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,380
Show some respect.

541
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,220
It's like this.

542
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,140
Wanwan

543
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,660
is staying at Guixiang's house for now.

544
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,420
Oh, right.

545
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,180
The girl's mom has probably been...

546
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,660
Cut the crap
and just write the prescription.

547
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,860
Dr. Jiang.

548
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,260
Just give them the prescription first.

549
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,860
I have some other questions for you.

550
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,900
Okay.

551
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,860
Do a urine routine

552
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,500
and a liver and kidney function test.

553
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,340
After that, get an IV drip.

554
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,980
Here.

555
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,660
He must have gone crazy
from studying too much.

556
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,100
He's so rude.

557
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,860
Next time, it's better not to talk
about her mother

558
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,180
in front of her.

559
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,820
She is still young,
but she knows what's happening.

560
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,220
Yes, okay.

561
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,020
Take a seat.

562
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,020
Sit.

563
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,700
Well,

564
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
when did you start treating Wanwan?

565
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,020
About when she was born.

566
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,660
Her illness is congenital.

567
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,380
Inherited?

568
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,780
Not exactly.

569
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,580
When Nan Ya was heavily pregnant,

570
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,900
Xu Yi had kicked her in the stomach.

571
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,020
She was born prematurely
and under developed.

572
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,020
Luo, I'm cold.

573
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,660
You're cold?

574
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,620
Here.

575
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,020
Cover with the blanket.

576
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,580
Sit here for a while.

577
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,980
I'll go get you a hot water bottle.

578
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,060
Okay.

579
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,300
Could you please take care of her?

580
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,100
Will do.

581
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,300
Does it hurt?

582
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,220
No.

583
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,420
Did Xu Yi and Nan Ya fight a lot?

584
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,500
Well, I don't really know.

585
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,980
I thought you saw Nan Ya
once a week.

586
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,780
I'm really not sure about that.

587
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,420
At first, she did show up
with bruises on her face.

588
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,020
But later, there weren't any.

589
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
Maybe because

590
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,340
Xu Yi knew better

591
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,180
and didn't slap her face.

592
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,620
When she got seriously hurt,

593
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,100
did she get herself treated
at the hospital?

594
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,020
Well...

595
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,780
I really can't answer you.

596
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,300
Besides, I'm a doctor

597
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
in the nephrology department.

598
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,100
That's not under my care.

599
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,260
So if she needs treatment,

600
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,660
which department will she go to?

601
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,820
General Surgery.

602
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Thanks.

603
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,500
No worries. See you.

604
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
There is no record
if they're not hospitalized.

605
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,420
You can only check
the outpatient record.

606
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,580
Which one is Nan Ya's?

607
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,180
The outpatient record

608
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,460
notes the treatment conditions
of daily patients.

609
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,460
There wouldn't be a specific one
for Nan Ya?

610
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,780
I can help you to find it.

611
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,500
I happened to be on duty one time.

612
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,020
Have you finished your work?

613
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,460
Have you changed the dressing
for Bed No. 4?

614
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,020
Did you get the test result
for No. 16?

615
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,380
I will finish them now.

616
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,060
Why are you checking these?

617
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,260

618
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,860
What case?

619
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,460
She killed him and admitted it.

620
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,020
Why bother verifying anything?

621

get her charges dropped?

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
why you're emotional.

625

But...

626
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,020
I'm not emotional.

627
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,700
Those two are nothing to me.

628
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,580
I just don't get it.

629

What is it that makes Nan Ya so special?

630
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,580
Why?

631
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,260
Why is everyone helping her?

632
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,260
If people were actually helping her,

633
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,900
then she probably wouldn't have
gotten beaten so badly.

634
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,820
You're a smart boy.

635
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,020

to keep a tight lip
in front of the police.

You don't know what's going on
with the adults.

00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,460

643
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,700
that Nan Ya did try to seduce me.

644
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,820
But I'd never

645

have anything to do with her.

647
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:11,900
Right.

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,220

I should tell you

she also killed someone.

742
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,660
Later, I met a man,

743
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,700
and I couldn't tolerate it anymore.

744
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,260
Whether to run away or be in jail,

745
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,860
I was going to end this.

746
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,900
That day, he was going to beat me again.

747
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,260
And I couldn't take it anymore.

748
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,220
I grabbed the knife and stabbed him.

749
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,580
Later, that man left too.

750
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,460
He didn't even spare me another look.

751
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,420
Still, deep down,

752
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,700
I don't blame him.

753
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,460
This was a case I investigated
20 years ago.

754
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
The whole village

755
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,940
spoke up for her.

756
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,060
They cracked down hard at the time.

757
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,220
The sentencing was mild in response.

758
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,700
The circumstances in each case

759
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,380
are all different.

760
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,060
A woman who's a victim
of domestic violence

761
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,620
is poor, of course.

762
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,460
Well,

763
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,380
you can

764
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,860
sympathize them,

765
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,580
but you should not ignore the truth.

766
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,620
As policemen,

767
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,620
we can't be carried away by compassion.

768
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,460
Since it's a crime of passion,

769
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,460
there must be some doubtful points.

770
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,460
The doubtful points are

771
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,060
that these things
all fit together perfectly.

772
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Don't you think

773
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,220
she and Wang Guihong

774
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,140
are kind of similar?

775
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,820
Are you saying

776
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,500
that she has an affair?
