00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 20]

2
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,710
Between my lover and me, 300 long nights

3
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,510
will be erected like 300 high walls.

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,680
And the sea

5
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,560
will be a magic show between us.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
So, I have to explain my relationship

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,640
with the boy again?

8
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,320
[Tender Light]

9
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,310
I don't care what you say

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,960
or what you think about me.

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,870
I just can't bear
to see you suffer here.

12
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,430
You may choose not to accept me.

13
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,030
You may even regard me

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,800
as an infatuated fool.

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,120
But I'm going
to take you away from here.

16
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,710
I'm going to take you
out of Qingshui Town.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,190
His thoughts

18
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
were just something that came
from his youth rebellious phase.

19
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,910
It was from his desire to conquer.

20
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
He had nowhere else to spend his energy.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
How could I take him seriously?

22
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
Are you saying

23
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,840
that you two aren't lovers?

24
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
Of course not.

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,840
Why would a person
record such a voice recording

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
for an irrelevant person?

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,870
Zhou Luo's family owns a video store.

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,150
He often makes such recordings.

29
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,560
He's just burning his favorite songs

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
into cassette tapes

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,520
and giving them to his friends.

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
If so, what kind of friends are you two?

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,560
I buy groceries
in his store occasionally.

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Sometimes, we chat.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
What do you guys chat about?

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,360
Poetry,

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,120
music,

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,400
dreams,

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,400
or love?

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,910
You should ask Guixiang

41
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,560
about what the customers talk about

42
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,840
when buying goods at her store.

43
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,800
What do they talk about?

44
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,360
Family matters

45
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,960
and trivial affairs.

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,120
For example?

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,710
The newest cassette tapes in the store,

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,000
the best songs we've heard,

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,120
and the kind of sweets
that Wanwan likes.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
When the weather was cold,

51
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,190
I'd help him choose a sweater.

52
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,710
You choose his sweater for him?

53
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,430
I chose all the outfits
for his entire family.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
Guixiang took care of Wanwan
on my behalf often.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
I should return her favor.

56
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,910
Has he ever told you

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,560
that he fancied you?

58
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,310
He didn't need to say it out.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,750
I'm much older than him.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,800
I could've guessed it somehow.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,040
He recorded several cassette tapes

62
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,630
and suffered several setbacks.

63
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,360
After that, he forgot all about it.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,190
There were lots of young girls
chasing him.

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,390
He would have a shining future.

66
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,310
Another world awaits him
after leaving Qingshui Town.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,190
Why would he still remember me?

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
For a woman in a broken relationship

69
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,870
who was abused by her husband
for a long time,

70
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,630
it's not shameful

71
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,870
to fall for someone else.

72
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,830
I'm a 30-year-old woman.

73
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,630
I no longer have any unrealistic dreams.

74
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,000
Relationships don't always go both ways.

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,240
Even a one-way relationship
can be passionate too.

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,190
He was injured and hospitalized
for you before.

77
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,830
Maybe

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,190
he could've done
other things for you too.

79
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,600
That's all your speculation.

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,950
Chen Ling loves you so much.

81
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,430
Why can't you just let me go?

82
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,270
Stop trying to shift the topic!

83
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you having an affair with Zhou Luo?

84
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,190
You're not answering me, huh?

85
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,430
I'll take it as a yes, then.

86
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll kill Zhou Luo right now!

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,830
This is the voice recording
on the night of his murder,

88
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,870
am I right?

89
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,310
That's right.

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
How do you explain this cassette tape?

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,190
Xu Yi was paranoid.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,310
When there was any man approaching me,

93
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,240
even talking to me,

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
he would hit me.

95
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,800
Initially, I wanted
to delete this recording.

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,430
But you didn't expect it
to record this conversation,

97
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,190
am I right?

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,070
Let me tell you a story.

99
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,950
Zhou Luo likes you.

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,510
And it's not like
you have no feelings for him.

101
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Nan Ya,

102
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
you're still pretending,

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,600
aren't you?

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
You wanted to get a divorce
and sell the house in a hurry.

105
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,920
It's because you have
an affair with another man, am I right?

106
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,830
I've been asking you
to divorce me for a long time.

107
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,560
Xu Yi,

108
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,510
I've handed the complaint to the court.

109
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,510
If you don't sign it,

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,070
I'll see you in court, then.

111
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,430
You don't want to give me the photo?

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,430
I'll head back and look for it myself.

113
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,360
If I find that photo,

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,190
I'll kill him tonight!

115
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,160
Mommy!

116
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,600
Xu Yi!

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,000
Zhou Luo.

118
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,870
Zhou Luo!

119
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,270
On Millennium Night,

120
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,040
Xu Yi found your affair with him.

121
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,510
He argued with you by the riverbank.

122
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,000
Zhou Luo followed you back home

123
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,270
as he was concerned about you.

124
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,870
Tell me! Where exactly is the photo?

125
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,720
Tell me!

126
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:04,630
Tell me!

127
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,560
Stop!

128
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,830
Let her go.

129
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,830
I was about to look for you.

130
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Since when have you two had an affair?

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,240
Zhou Luo, this is none of your business!

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,310
Leave here!

133
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,830
Since you deliver yourself
to my doorstep,

134
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,160
I'll send you to hell!

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Zhou Luo, run!

136
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,390
Xu Yi, stop it!

137
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,600
Zhou Luo, run!

138
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,430
Xu Yi!

139
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,950
You jerk!

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,510
You...

141
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,240
Scram!

142
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,670
You wench!

143
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,870
How dare you protect him?

144
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,120
Zhou Luo, run!

145
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,000
I...

146
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,510
No.

147
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,440
It was me who killed him.

148
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,080
How was the story?

149
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,600
A confused youth

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,030
killed someone by accident

151
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,030
because the person he loved was injured.

152
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,200
Therefore,

153
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,080
you decided to take the blame
on his behalf.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,080
That's impossible.

155
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,390
One side of a cassette tape
can only record 30 minutes at most.

156
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,440
When I pressed the record button,

157
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,720
Xu Yi only went upstairs
after over ten minutes.

158
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,030
Xu Yi!

159
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,320
After that, we continued our argument
all the way to the riverbank.

160
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,200
The entire process

161
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,790
lasted for over an hour.

162
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,270
The tape recorder cannot
record the entire process.

163
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,150
Your story was touching,

164
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,510
but the reality is cruel.

165
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,960
It's not as romantic
and wonderful as you think.

166
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,630
It's our instinct
to seek gain and avoid harm.

167
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,000
Why would he get himself in trouble

168
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,910
when he had a bright future
ahead of him?

169
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,790
Don't you agree?

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,510
Take a break.

171
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,510
How did it go?

172
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,750
She's very stubborn.

173
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,910
She didn't say anything, huh?

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,840
Liu,

175
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,360
tell the identification bureau

176
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,840
to search the crime scene again.

177
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,790
Gather all the fingerprints
and footprints they can find.

178
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,390
Okay.

179
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,000
Besides, send the skin tissue
in Xu Yi's nails

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,030
back to the province

181
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,550
to make a comparison
with Zhou Luo's DNA.

182
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,120
No problem.

183
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,270
Also,

184
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,360
tell the medical examiners
to examine the knife wound

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,670
on Xu Yi's back thoroughly.

186
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Tell them to do a test
if they can't identify it.

187
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,910
No problem.

188
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,150
You've worked hard.

189
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,790
Well, as for your speculation,

190
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,790
don't you think it's too bold?

191
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,200
Although Zhou Luo is intelligent,

192
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,960
he's young after all.

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,870
How could he be this calm
after killing someone?

194
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,200
His statements were seamless

195
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,630
with no room for errors.

196
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,440
They might've acted in collusion to make
each other's confessions identical.

197
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,750
But they didn't have
enough time to do so.

198
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,030
Don't forget,

199
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,750
Nan Ya turned herself in at 2 AM.

200
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,910
Zhou Luo reported the case at 6 AM.

201
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,720
During that period,

202
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,750
he had more than enough time
to calm himself down

203
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,360
and think about
how to deal with the situation.

204
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,960
Or,

205
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,670
there might be another possibility.

206
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,120
What is it?

207
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,550
Zhou Luo's family might've
also been involved in the concealment.

208
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,960
I don't think

209
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,200
that's possible.

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
There's Wanwan too, you know?

211
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,750
Although she's young,

212
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,910
she's already sensible.

213
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,320
Well,

214
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,910
even if Zhou Luo did kill Xu Yi

215
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,080
without leaving any traces behind,

216
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,750
do you think he's capable enough

217
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,750
to train a young kid like her

218
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,870
to lie together with him?

219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,270
Mr. Chen!

220
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,870
Officer Lin!

221
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,270
I want to report Zhou Luo.

222
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,870
Look at this photo.

223
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,550
Look here.

224
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,670
And here.

225
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,150
It's obvious that someone used
a photo-retouching software

226
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,840
to make the two photos into one.

227
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
And look at the back.

228
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,600
Officer Lin, you know this well enough.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,080
Our shop didn't develop this photo.

230
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,080
What has this got to do with Zhou Luo?

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm sure Zhou Luo placed it

232
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,870
in our shop on purpose.

233
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,510
He wanted me to see it.

234
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,670
I went to find Xu Yi

235
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,200
after my father was missing.

236
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,910
Back then, Xu Yi slapped my face
with a stack of photos.

237
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,030
He even choked me

238
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,150
and said I was following him

239
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,600
as well as blackmailing him.

240
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,670
Back then, I thought it was strange.

241
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,440
I thought to myself
that he might have a lot of enemies.

242
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,240
But when I went back,

243
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,960
I thought something was amiss.

244
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,720
I checked the receipts
we gave out that day.

245
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,630
I found that Zhou Luo
came to take his ID photo

246
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,550
in our shop two days
before the photo showed up.

247
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,630
Besides,

248
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,670
as for the photo of my father
and Xu Yi at the restaurant,

249
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,750
it was taken by the same person
who took this one.

250
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,510
Who else could it be
if it wasn't Zhou Luo?

251
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm sure he must have threatened Xu Yi.

252
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,270
That's why Xi Yi killed my father.

253
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,360
Enough.

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
You had an issue with Zhou Luo.

255
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
Is that why you're pushing the blame
on him for everything?

256
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,510
We require evidence
for our investigation, you know?

257
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,390
You think we make
wild accusations like you?

258
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,390
Just look at how much trouble
you've caused lately.

259
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,360
You've ruined Zhang Qingli's reputation,

260
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,120
am I right?

261
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
How can she live
with her head held up high now?

262
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
The school has already suspended him,

263
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,790
but he's still trying to make a scene.

264
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,960
Don't think that I have no idea.

265
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,510
Your son and Zhou Luo are good friends.

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,870
Is that why you're covering up for him?

267
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,840
I would've taught you a lesson right now

268
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
had I not been a police!

269
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,600
Fine. I'll avoid arousing suspicion.

270
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,670
Talk to him, then.

271
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,150
You're just covering up for him!

272
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,670
You guys are in cahoots!

273
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,360
You guys are ganging up on our family!

274
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,120
Liu Xun!

275
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,720
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,000
Where do you think you are?

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
This is the police station!

278
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,960
I understand

279
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,840
the situation you're in.

280
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,910
You can head back first.

281
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,120
I'll tell you the result

282
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,030
once I get to the bottom of the case.

283
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,750
S-u-s-p-i-c-i-o-n.

284
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,870
S-u-s-p-i-c-i-o-n.

285
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,080
- Suspicion. - Suspicion.

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,910
Stress.

287
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Stress.

288
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,870
S-t-r-e-s-s.

289
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,960
S-t-r-e-s-s.

290
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,200
Zhang Qingli, where are you going?

291
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,120
S-i-l-e-n-c-e.

292
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,670
S-i-l-e-n-c-e.

293
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,510
- Silence. - Silence.

294
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,630
You cannot come here!

295
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,600
You're still suspended from school!

296
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,790
Your punishment hasn't been revoked yet!

297
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,590
You cannot go inside!

298
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,590
You cannot go inside!

299
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,160
You're still suspended from school!

300
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,270
Your punishment hasn't been revoked yet!

301
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,000
What's going on?

302
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,680
I want to go to school.

303
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,960
No way.

304
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,750
What you did

305
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
went against the school's
regulations completely.

306
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,830
And you're not remorseful
about it at all.

307
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,310
What have I done wrong?

308
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,960
Which of my words weren't true?

309
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,550
What?

310
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,160
Are you picking on me

311
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,440
just because
your daughter's reputation was ruined?

312
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,680
She should've stayed away from Zhou Luo

313
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
and shouldn't have done
such a dirty thing

314
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,160
if she cared about her reputation!

315
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Shut up!

316
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,350
I won't!

317
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,000
Zhou Luo was punished as well.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,440
Why didn't you report him
to the superior of the Education Bureau

319
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
when the superior came
to inspect the school?

320
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,400
What?

321
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,960
Is it because you think
I'm no longer useful to you?

322
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,790
You... You're now expelled!

323
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,680
Tell your mother to come
and complete the procedures tomorrow.

324
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,070
Don't you dare!

325
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,440
Why wouldn't I dare?

326
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,960
I, Zhang Huashan, founded this school.

327
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,400
I'm in charge here.

328
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't want a student like you!

329
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,400
My father is dead.

330
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
If you dare expel me,

331
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,160
I'll make sure
your school will close down!

332
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,400
I'll make sure of it!

333
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,000
Sir!

334
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,440
What are you all looking at?

335
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,240
Let's just bear with him.

336
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,550
Just a few more months.

337
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,640
We can't afford to offend him.

338
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,750
Let him be.

339
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,640
Zhou Luo!

340
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,680
Madam Guixiang!

341
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,070
What's wrong?

342
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,720
Madam Guixiang, I have good news.

343
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,880
I have good news!

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,720
Zhou Luo,

345
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,200
you can return to school now.

346
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,240
- Really? - Yes!

347
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,240
Mr. Zhang told us to notify you.

348
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,720
He said Zhou Luo could return to school

349
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
after he handed
in his reflection report.

350
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,790
It's all thanks to Liu Xun.

351
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,750
Zhang Huashan wouldn't have said so

352
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,160
had he not caused trouble at school.

353
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,400
What trouble did he cause?

354
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,440
He said

355
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,750
he would make a scene at school

356
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,440
if they didn't allow him
to return to school.

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,750
Anyway, he's going back to school.

358
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,550
It wouldn't make sense

359
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,640
if they didn't allow you
to return to school.

360
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,880
By the way,

361
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,350
Zhang Qingli is
under her father's watch right now.

362
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,440
She can't join us at the moment.

363
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,590
She wanted me to tell you

364
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,720
that she already wrote
the reflection report for you.

365
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,270
You can just head to school tomorrow.

366
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,310
That'll be unnecessary.

367
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,640
Luo, write the report yourself.

368
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,590
Sure, I'll write it myself.

369
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,070
Why do you look so grumpy?

370
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,920
No, I'm not.

371
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,510
How about I write it for you?

372
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,160
Keep an eye on them.

373
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,000
Chen Jun!

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,310
Keep an eye on him!
Hurry and finish the report!

375
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,350
Huashan,

376
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,350
we know

377
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,200
that you did a lot

378
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
for Zhou Luo.

379
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,790
Zhou Luo was able to receive
the grade reduction notice from Jinghua

380
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,750
all thanks to you.

381
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,440
Indeed.

382
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,880
You guys don't need to say that.

383
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,960
We already had over 100 students

384
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,240
before he joined us.

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,350
You can ask around and will know

386
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,440
each of them is here
because of the school's reputation.

387
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,920
I don't need him
to build up our school's reputation.

388
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,240
That's not what I mean.

389
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,920
Have some water.

390
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,680
Thank you.

391
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,750
Mr. Zhang, Mrs. Zhang,

392
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,920
I wish to say something
from my heart today.

393
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,070
Please pardon me

394
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,400
if I say anything wrong.

395
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Qingli

396
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,590
is truly an excellent child.

397
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,750
I truly like her.

398
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,640
That's right.

399
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,680
I would be so happy

400
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,000
if she got together with Zhou Luo.

401
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,000
Zhou Luo is just too eye-catching.

402
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Plenty of people in school
are jealous of him,

403
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,030
which let your daughter be wronged.

404
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,400
We felt sorry about it.

405
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
We came here to apologize to you.

406
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,400
However,

407
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
I'll never believe

408
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
that they two

409
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,830
would do something improper.

410
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,070
Do you two believe it?

411
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,750
I've already asked Zhou Luo about it.

412
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,270
Zhou Luo swore

413
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,790
that he never did such a thing.

414
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,920
Someone was causing trouble on purpose.

415
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,750
My child has grown up.

416
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,030
It's not like he's willing

417
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,000
to tell us about everything.

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,550
In addition, his father and I
aren't well-educated.

419
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,920
However, I...

420
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
I just want to say

421
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,440
that we hope the best for our children.

422
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,110
All parents in the world

423
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,920
would like to devote everything
to their children.

424
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,590
Huashan,

425
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,030
you were the one who took Zhou Luo in.

426
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,200
He'll surely remember your kindness

427
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,240
when he's successful in the future.

428
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,000
That's right.

429
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,830
Actually,

430
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,400
we watched them growing up.

431
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,920
It's not like we have no idea

432
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,440
what kind of child Zhou Luo is.

433
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,200
That's right.

434
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,550
What Mrs. Zhang said is true.

435
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,550
These children are
very close to each other.

436
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
He would do everything
to protect Qingli.

437
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,550
Why would he bully her?

438
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,680
Besides, if both of them

439
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,640
do get into a university
in Beijing together,

440
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,590
at least they can
take care of each other.

441
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,240
Isn't that a good thing?

442
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,440
That's all in the future.

443
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,350
It's up to them.

444
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,160
It actually

445
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
depends on you.

446
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,920
Well, we'll leave you to it.

447
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,550
Take your stuff.

448
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,350
Don't forget about them.

449
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,440
We brought them specially for you.

450
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,830
We'll come again.

451
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,790
We'll visit you again.

452
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,440
Thank you.

453
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,590
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

454
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,590
See you.

455
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,200
Thank you.

456
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,440
Thank you, Mrs. Zhang.

457
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,030
They were singing the same tune.

458
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,830
What were they doing?

459
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,590
The liquor is pretty good though.

460
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,350
Bring it inside.

461
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,720
But the college entrance exam is coming.

462
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
Studying is their priority.

463
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,830
We shouldn't let them
contact each other that often.

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,880
Does Chen Ling

465
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,880
feel better now?

466
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,440
Xu Yi deserved to die.

467
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,310
My sister will be free after his death.

468
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,750
Better a little loss than a long sorrow.

469
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
So you also think
that I murdered Xu Yi?

470
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,830
Zhou Luo.

471
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,550
I won't ask you again.

472
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,920
But I believe

473
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,070
that my buddy isn't a villain.

474
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,440
All right now.

475
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,440
Let's go.

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
Qingli's lie was exposed.

477
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,830
Will Lin Fanglu put you
under tight surveillance?

478
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,310
It's pointless for him to do so.

479
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,070
It is really dark, huh?

[Poetry Anthology,

481
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,440
Luo, you're finally back.

482
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,110
Officer Lin is in your room.

483
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,070
You like poetry, huh?

484
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,790
Which poem do you like the most?

485
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm a science student.

486
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,070
I don't know poetry well.

487
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,750
I'm just reading them for fun.

[Poetry Anthology; Borrower: Nan Ya]

489
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,160
Nan Ya was the only person
who borrowed this book before.

490
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,160
Your name wasn't on the library card.

491
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,880
You stole it from the library.

492
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,590
Why?

493
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,680
I forgot why.

494
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,110
You shouldn't touch
other people's stuff.

495
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,160
I don't think you forgot the reason.

496
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,110
What exactly are you trying to say?

497
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,510
You like poetry,

498
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,030
but you like the person
who reads these poems even more.

499
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,640
Are you here to interrogate me
or chat with me?

500
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,640
Please leave

501
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,750
if you wish to chat with me.

I have something else to do.

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,880
Do you recognize this cassette tape?

504
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,550
I love her.

505
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,440
But it won't change

506
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,920
what I saw that night.

507
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,070
Are you sure about that?

508
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,110
If so, why are you
trying so hard to hide

509
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,160
and distance yourself from her?

510
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,310
I just don't want to prevent her

511
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,270
from receiving the justice she deserves.

512
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,640
You've already prevented her.

513
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,110
If so, is there a difference
between the evidence you found

514
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,920
and what I said?

515
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,590
There are countless possibilities
of what happened that night.

516
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,720
However, what you did

517
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,550
has already reduced
the credibility of your testimony.

518
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,070
You're not helping Nan Ya.

519
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,310
Think carefully.

520
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,440
Are there any details or evidence

521
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,830
that you might've missed?

522
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,510
Or is there anything

523
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,830
you're hiding from me?

524
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,640
Be quick.

525
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
This is the only chance I can give you.

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,590
are you heading back now?

00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,880
Nan Ya,

529
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
do you believe in love?

530
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,270
I know it sounds ridiculous.

531
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,200
A person who has
never truly loved someone

532
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,590
is trying to talk about love

533
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,680
with a woman whom he has
no chance to be with.

534
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
But I know

535
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
that the feeling inside me

536
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,000
cannot be suppressed or cast aside.

537
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,440
It's just like a piece of burning coal.

00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,680
It hurts.

Officer Lin had a relationship
with Nan Ya before.

546
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,270
Really?

547
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,790
They had a relationship
when they were in high school.

548
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,550
No wonder Officer Lin
was so protective of Nan Ya.

What's wrong?

555
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,680
It's nothing.

556
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,270
Officer Lin, I should go.

557
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,790
Morning, Officer Lin.

558
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,030
Morning, Officer Lin.

559
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,550
Morning.

560
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,830
Morning.

561
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,440
Officer Lin.

562
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,440
Chen,

563
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,350
the medical examiner's report is out.

564
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,110
Have you read it?

565
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,920
Yeah.

566
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,070
But it's not strong enough.

567
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,550
Doesn't that say enough?

568
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,630
Officer Lin, Chen,

569
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,750
Officer Xu wants to see you two.

570
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,550
What's wrong?

571
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,510
All of you are acting strange today.

572
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,310
Hu Xiu reported you to the authorities.

573
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,680
Come in.

574
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,720
Well...

575
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,110
As for Nan Ya's case,

576
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,000
Officer Xu is angry about it now.

577
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,680
Look at this.

578
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,590
Did you write this?

579
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,440
Where did you get this from?

580
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,200
Hu Xiu gave it to us.

581
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,110
Lin Fanglu,

582
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,440
I just want to know
if you and Nan Ya...

583
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,270
No.

584
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,720
If there was something between us,

585
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,960
I would've written about it
in the report.

586
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,200
Back then, I was not sure
how I felt about her.

587
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,920
But it happened
when I was in high school.

588
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,070
It's all in the past now.

589
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,830
I know that it happened
over ten years ago.

590
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,070
But I want to ask you this.

591
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,680
Did you guys keep in touch after that...

592
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,440
No.

593
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,240
Sir,

594
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,550
don't tell me you're doubting
his professionalism.

595
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,510
If you have doubts about him,

596
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,790
I can guarantee

597
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,920
that he's not trying to defend her.

598
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,640
He didn't stop his investigation

599
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,830
after Nan Ya's application of the right
of self-defense was submitted.

600
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,720
Did you think I had no idea
about his effort?

601
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,790
The thing is, Hu Xiu reported him
to us at this moment.

602
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,240
We were caught off-guard.

603
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
Besides, she even has a letter.

604
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,350
Did Hu Xiu say

605
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,790
where she got the letter from?

606
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,400
She said you sent the letter to Nan Ya.

607
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,440
It was a long time ago.

608
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,510
She just remembered.

609
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,800
Do many people know about this?

610
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,230
Or he can just deny it.

611
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,630
There's no signature on it anyway.

612
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,110
You're messing around here.

613
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,920
Both the names and the schools match.

614
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Anyone can tell that
it's his handwriting at first glance

615
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,320
if we send it for appraisal.

616
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,440
It doesn't seem like
the content is improper.

617
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,360
If this gets out of hand,

618
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,710
what should we do with the case?

619
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,710
What should we do?

620
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,510
Here. See?

621
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,800
Did you see these?

622
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,440
This is a document
from the provincial department!

623
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,190
They are also

624
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,960
asking about the result
of Nan Ya's case.

625
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,070
They even said that we could
submit a petition to withdraw the case

626
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,840
if it was a case
of the right of self-defense.

627
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,960
If so, we have to release her.

628
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,030
Now,

629
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,920
we're on thin ice.

630
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,670
Don't release her first.

631
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,840
I can withdraw from the case
to avoid arousing suspicion.

632
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,760
That won't do.

633
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,710
You were the one who found
all the breakthrough points.

634
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
Now, we have new evidence.

635
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,070
We need to wait
for the identification bureau

636
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,360
to give us their report.

637
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,400
Sir,

638
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,280
didn't the superiors

639
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,800
already approve Chen's report?

640
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
Since Chen Ling isn't a suspect

641
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,440
and she has an alibi in the hospital,

642
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
doesn't that mean
Chen can be reinstated to his post?

643
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,760
Chen will be in charge

644
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,070
of the interrogation and investigation.

645
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,070
As for me,

646
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
I'll offer ideas to him in secret.

647
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,440
That's all you can do for now.

648
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,110
Hu Xiu was determined

649
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,710
to say that
you were covering up for Nan Ya.

650
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,960
Xu Yi's family called us as well.

651
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,920
The superiors will find out very soon.

652
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,150
Instead of that,

653
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,000
we should deal with it
ourselves in advance.

654
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,360
Thank you, sir.

655
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,760
Don't take it to heart.

656
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,150
Why do you look so nonchalant about it?

657
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Did you intend to quit long ago?

658
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,670
So you can have a good rest?

659
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,760
Don't you think

660
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,800
that we're pretty much closer

661
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
to the truth behind the incident now?

662
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,960
We don't have any evidence.

663
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,190
It's pointless
even if all your speculations are true.

664
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Now, I have a risky proposition.

665
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,590
However, we need to put
some effort into persuading Officer Xu.

666
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,440
Are you willing to give it a try?

667
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,440
Tell me about it.

668
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
You have to treat me with a meal
if you wish to know it.

669
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,800
Don't tell me, then.

670
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,630
Well.

671
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,030
You're the best cook
in Qingshui Town, no?

672
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,320
I've been craving your cooking
for so long.

673
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Does that mean
we have to buy ingredients?

674
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:40,630
Yeah.

675
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,590
Officer Lin.

676
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,920
Okay.

677
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,030
Zhou Luo.

678
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,670
How did you find out?

679
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,960
Find out what?

680
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,280
My relationship with Nan Ya.

681
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
What's your relationship with Nan Ya?

682
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,110
Hu Xiu reported me
to the Yishan Police.

683
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,590
It was all part of your plan, wasn't it?

684
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
Having Liu Xun discover the photo,

685
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,630
the discovery of Xu Yi's hideout,

686
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,840
reporters swarming me,

687
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
and Hu Xiu's report to the authorities.

688
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,920
All of the arrangements

689
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,360
might seem like
they have nothing to do with you,

690
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,000
but you could offer a helping hand

691
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,670
to make them happen.

692
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,960
Do you think I'm capable enough
to do these things?

693
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,550
I will no longer be in charge

694
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,320
of Nan Ya's case.

695
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,400
This must be the result you desired.

696
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
But Zhou Luo,

697
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,440
even though I've withdrawn
from the case,

698
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,590
there's no way you can stop the police

699
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
from revealing the truth.

700
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,230
I'm just an eyewitness.

701
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,920
This has nothing to do with me.

702
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,070
Zhou Luo,

703
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
in this world,

704
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,920
there are no perfect crimes.
