[Episode 24]

2
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,660
Nan Ya, do you believe in love?

3
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,100
I know I must sound ridiculous.

4
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,500
A person who's never really been in love

5
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,900
talking about love with a woman

6
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,900
whom he can never be with.

7
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,940
But I know.

8
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
The thing in my heart

9
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,340
cannot be suppressed or thrown away.

10
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,570
It's like a hot piece of coal.

11
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,740
It hurts.

12
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,380
It hurts a lot
if you don't pay enough attention.

13
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,940
It makes you happy at this moment
but upset at the next moment.

14
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,060
I suppose that's love.

15
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,100
You wish to get close,

16
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,260
but you can't.

17
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,660
You want to push it away,
but you can't bear to.

18
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,380
You said you're older than me.

19
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,020
Then tell me what it is.

20
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,460
I know this isn't the right time
to say these things.

21
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,140
But if I don't tell you,

22
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,260
you'll never be able to hear it.

23
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,260
[ZIJIN]
You said you're leaving,

24
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,180
and I can't do anything.

25
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,260
The words of retention

26
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,620
seem so pale and inadequate,

27
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,100
even childish and selfish.

28
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,020
I know.

29
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,180
You wish to get rid of everything here.

30
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,620
And escaping from here
is the only option.

31
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,940
Nan Ya.

32
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,140
I will wait for you.

33
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll always wait for you.

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,780
No matter where you are,

35
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,060
there will be a person
who quivers when hearing your name,

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,940
until

37
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,340
you are willing to look back at me.

38
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,540
Until the day we meet again.

39
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:46,420
[Tender Light]

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,470
[Stray Birds]

41
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,340
I checked, and no one's around.

42
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,460
Let me in. I have something for you.

43
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,820
What is it?

44
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,740
I took these photos the last few days.

45
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,060
He's involved in the bridge case.

46
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,580
Why did you follow him?

47
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
This is a good chance.

48
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,220
The bridge case has caused two deaths.

49
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,420
If he's sentenced,

50
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,700
he'll stay in jail
for at least 8 to 10 years.

51
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,860
Do you want to get yourself killed?

52
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Don't you know
how unscrupulous Xu Yi is?

53
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,780
This is a serious case.

54
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,620
What do you think he'll do
if he finds out?

55
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,380
He will do anything.

56
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,620
It's okay.

57
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,700
We hid ourselves well. He didn't see us.

58
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,540
"We"?

59
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,660
Who else is doing these with you?

60
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,780
Never mind that.

61
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,820
The point is,

62
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
I'm sure when Xu Yi runs out of options,

63
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,500
he'll turn himself in.

64
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,060
You think I don't know
he's involved in it?

65
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,220
I can look for the evidence myself.

66
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,020
That's different.

67
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,860
I told you.

68
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,820
I'll take you away from Qingshui town.

69
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm a 30-year-old woman.

70
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,660
An adult.

71
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,020
I'm an adult too.

72
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,100
A person who has not entered society

73
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,860
can't be considered an adult.

74
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,100
Life is full of dangers,
do you know that?

75
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,300
Stop involving yourself
in such dirty businesses.

76
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,660
The college entrance exam is coming up.

77
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,820
You need to focus on your studies
and forget about everything else.

78
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,340
I'm not worried about the exam at all.

79
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,420
I'll get into the best university.

80
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,460
Then we'll be able to...

81
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,380
Shut up!

82
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,580
Stop whatever you're doing right now.

83
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,740
If you skip another class,

84
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,460
I'm going to tell your mom.

85
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
I'm not following him anymore.

86
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,300
And I've found another way.

87
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,340
I mean what I say.

88
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,900
If I continue to indulge you,

89
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,540
it's only going to do harm to you.

90
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,820
Harm me, then.

91
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,980
We'll need to set rules.

92
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,780
So long as I can see you,

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,500
whatever you say is fine.

94
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,140
Stop meddling in the bridge case.

95
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,180
Okay.

96
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,340
Keep your distance in public.

97
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,100
Learn how to protect yourself.

98
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,180
Okay.

99
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,900
Don't harbor any illusions of me.

100
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,540
You're going to control
how I think and feel too?

101
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,460
If you don't agree,
don't ever come to see me again.

102
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,100
Fine, I agree.

103
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,460
You won't know
if I mean what I say anyway.

104
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,100
I don't think Liu Xun knows
where his dad is.

105
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,460
Why would he pester Xu Yi otherwise?

106
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,100
Should we tell him?

107
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,540
He's here. Keep your voice down.

108
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,820
But Liu Changshui
has been missing for days.

109
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,580
We don't know where he is either.

110
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,540
Maybe Liu Xun knows something.

111
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,700
If we tell him,

112
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,180
we might get more useful information.

113
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,700
No way.

114
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,940
Whom does his dad make money for?

115
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,060
It's for him. Why would he give you
any evidence?

116
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,460
I'm pretty sure Xu Yi and Liu Changshui

117
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,020
made a deal previously.

118
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
It seems like Liu Changshui
has gone missing.

119
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
He's probably run off.

120
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,820
If we tell Liu Xun now,

121
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,900
it might just cause more trouble.

122
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,540
Forget it. Let's talk later.

123
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:27,860
Quiet down.

124
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Everyone, please get seated.

125
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,180
I have a good news to announce.

126
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,100
It's about Jinghua University's
special admission.

127
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,260
We recommended two students.

128
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,900
And we've received the reply today.

129
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,860
Zhou Luo is selected for a retest.

130
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,740
Zhou Luo...

131
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,500
Quiet down.

132
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,540
Liu Xun,

133
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,780
don't be disheartened.

134
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,300
Competition is fierce

135
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,060
for this special admission.

136
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,820
Your result was pretty good.

137
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,020
But there's only one spot

138
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,500
allotted for our county.

139
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,780
Even if you can't get into Jinghua,

140
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,020
you can still
take the college entrance exam.

141
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,580
There are plenty
of national key universities.

142
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,180
So,

143
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,620
remember what I said.

144
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,980
As long as you get into a good school,

145
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,500
nobody cares

146
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
how many college entrance exams
you've taken.

147
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,900
So no need to feel ashamed.

148
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,660
Pick up your spirits

149
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,900
and learn from Zhou Luo.

150
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,660
Alright!

151
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,820
Liu Xun.

152
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,300
Liu Xun.

153
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Liu Xun.

154
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,460
Get back here.

155
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,500
Where are you going?

156
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,700
Quiet.

157
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,100
Silence!

158
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,260
Quiet down!

159
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,460
Jealousy is no use.

160
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,260
But we encourage healthy competition.

161
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
You have to study hard!

162
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,540
Alright,

163
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,500
let's start the class.

164
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,060
The house is much livelier
with you lot around.

165
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,860
Mr. Zhou, I wish you could see it.

166
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,700
Liu Xun looked about to explode.

167
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,020
He's been competing with Zhou Luo
from the start.

168
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,780
What's that called?

169
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,020
Overestimating one's capabilities.

170
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,460
Yes! He overestimated his capabilities.

171
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,900
Zhou Luo.

172
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,300
I've told you many times.

173
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,820
A person should always be humble

174
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,100
in whatever occasion.

175
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,100
When you show off,

176
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,420
you'll make people hate you.

177
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,300
When did your son ever show off?

178
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,620
Right, Mr. Zhou.
Zhou Luo keeps a low profile in school.

179
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,260
Low profile?

180
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
I heard about it from your dad.

181
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,300
He said,

182
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,940
when other people are having class,

183
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,140
he's playing basketball.

184
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,740
When others are solving questions,

185
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,980
he's listening to music.

186
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,500
Isn't that showing off?

187
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,980
That's nothing, really.

188
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,940
I thought it was cool, Mr. Zhou.

189
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,260
What's so cool about him?

190
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,780
Today,

191
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
I'll show you what being cool truly is.

192
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,140
I'll make

193
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,740
my signature dish,
the Zhou's steamed fish.

194
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,180
- That'll be awesome.
- Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

195
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,540
He only knows

196
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
how to make that one dish.

197
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,060
Go on, then.

198
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,460
Thanks, Mr. Zhou.

199
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,540
You better keep a low profile.

200
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Okay.

201
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,980
Next time, I'll pretend I don't know
how to solve the questions,

202
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,500
and pay extra attention in class.

203
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,140
And deliberately
flunk the tests several times.

204
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,420
That won't do.

205
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,820
You've always submitted
the answer sheets early.

206
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,660
Who would believe
you getting low scores?

207
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,700
It's too obvious.

208
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,860
I've handed in my answers early too.

209
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,900
That's because
you haven't written anything on them.

210
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,780
Thanks.

211
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,860
By the way, Qingli,

212
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,060
when you're leaving

213
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,260
remind me of this.

214
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,020
I bought two bottles of nice liquor
for your dad.

215
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,100
Bring them for him.

216
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,540
Luo is able to achieve this result

217
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,540
thanks to him.

218
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,060
No need, Auntie Guixiang.

219
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,580
My dad is expecting Zhou Luo

220
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,100
to win him a reputation.

221
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,700
You are

222
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,300
just too adorable.

223
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,540
Auntie Guixiang.

224
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,940
If you like our Qingli so much,
you could take her...

225
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,980
Bingbing.

226
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,420
What? Don't be shy.

227
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,940
You want to go study
in Beijing too, right?

228
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,460
You can get Zhou Luo
to be your private tutor.

229
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,620
That's a good idea.

230
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,860
Luo.

231
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,740
In the future,

232
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,620
don't go to the library at night.

233
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Go and give Qingli extra classes.

234
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,980
It doesn't have to be every day.

235
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,900
Twice a week would be good.

236
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,140
Okay.

237
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,580
Come over and eat here
when you take extra classes.

238
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,340
I'll cook delicious food for you.

239
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,140
Thanks, Auntie Guixiang.

240
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,500
It's ready.

241
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,340
Try this.

242
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,980
Have a taste.

243
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,180
You did a good job today.

244
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,300
The fish looks delicious.

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,620
Yeah.

246
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,900
Come on, Luo.

247
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Here, raise your glass.

248
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,700
Congratulations on successfully
getting a retest.

249
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,780
Keep it up.

250
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,380
May every one of you get good results.

251
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,940
Yes, yes.

252
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,020
Congratulations, Zhou Luo!

253
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,900
May everyone achieve good grades.

254
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,700
Come on, let's eat.

255
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,140
Let's eat.

256
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,940
Try the food.

257
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,060
Auntie Guixiang, have one of these.

258
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Thank you.

259
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,940
Goodbye, Auntie Guixiang.

260
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,700
Bye, Auntie Guixiang.

261
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,060
Hang on, wait a minute.

262
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,940
Take these supplements
and divide them among yourselves.

263
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,380
Don't waste the good stuff on us.

264
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,420
Save them for Zhou Luo.

265
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,820
We're off. No, thanks.

266
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,620
Bye, Auntie Guixiang.

267
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,140
Qingli.

268
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,300
Wait.

269
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,940
Let Zhou Luo send you home.

270
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,060
Luo.

271
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,780
Take this

272
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,020
and give it to Qingli's dad.

273
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,620
Thanks, Auntie Guixiang.

274
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,340
You're welcome.

275
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,340
We'll be going now.

276
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,860
We're off.

277
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,060
Bye, Auntie Guixiang.

278
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,180
Ride slowly.

279
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Don't worry.

280
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,380
We're off.

281
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,500
Bye-bye.

282
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,340
Qingli, you've got this.

283
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,620
Hurry up and go.

284
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,740
Quickly, Chen Jun.

285
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,980
I heard

286
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,780
Jinghua is in the Haidian District.

287
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,620
What other schools are there, I wonder?

288
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,380
There should be plenty.

289
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,020
Which schools do you think
I can get into with my grades?

290
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,100
You can do some research.

291
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,940
Find one that you like.

292
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,860
As long as it's close to Jinghua,

293
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,820
it doesn't matter which school
I get into.

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,580
I'll go look for you, then.

295
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,620
How about I ride the bike
and take you back?

296
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,580
I want to take a walk.

297
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,500
My dad's just going to watch over me
when I get home.

298
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,980
I need to pee.

299
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,260
Sorry.

300
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,500
Okay.

301
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,620
Well...

302
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,100
Be safe.

303
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,060
Take care on the way back.

304
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,860
Jinghua?

305
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,260
How high is the probability
of getting accepted

306
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,020
through sitting for the retest?

307
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,020
I don't know.

308
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,900
What I heard is that
there are two scenarios.

309
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,020
Either I get a guaranteed admission,

310
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
or they give me
a grade reduction notice.

311
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,660
A repeat student like me won't be
getting a guaranteed admission though.

312
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,340
You're awesome!

313
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,300
This is nothing.

314
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,460
I have many more talents you don't know.

315
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,220
How about I help you with the ironing?

316
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,340
How could you know how to iron clothes?

317
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,860
You should go home and revise instead.

318
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,660
Don't lose this opportunity in the hand.

319
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,220
I don't need to revise.

320
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,580
Even without the reduced score notice,

321
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,460
I'll be able to be admitted.

322
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,860
Come off it.

323
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,900
I'm jealous of these kids.

324
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,420
They are able

325
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,580
to wear clothes made by you

326
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,620
and run about.

327
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,700
If you manage to get accepted,

328
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,420
I'll make one for you too.

329
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,580
Then I hope all my future clothes

330
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,540
can be made by you.

331
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,300
You should go home now.

332
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,100
You're getting in the way of my work.

333
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,380
It's fine.

334
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,380
Even if

335
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,220
I don't go home, I'd either
be running at this time

336
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,980
or studying at the library.
My mom lets me be.

337
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,020
I can help you hang up these clothes.

338
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,620
Hang these two up, then.

339
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,740
Guixiang, don't forget my order.

340
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,380
Don't worry. I'll get them for you
when I go to the city.

341
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,420
Alright, thanks.

342
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,900
Qingli.

343
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,140
Auntie Guixiang.

344
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
You left your bag here.

345
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,460
I was waiting for you to come back.

346
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,700
Here you go.

347
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Thanks, Auntie Guixiang.

348
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,980
Where is Zhou Luo?

349
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,900
Isn't he back?

350
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,940
No, he's not.

351
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,220
He said he needed to go to the restroom,
so he left in a hurry.

352
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,100
He must have found a place
somewhere to do it.

353
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,580
Alright, then.

354
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,140
You take care.

355
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Okay, I'm leaving.

356
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,300
Bye, Auntie Guixiang.

357
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,180
Give my regards to him your dad.

358
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,180
Will do.

359
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,820
Nan Ya.

360
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,980
Did you find
any particular poem you like

361
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,460
in the poem collections
you read recently?

362
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,660
As if I have the time to read poems.

363
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,380
I recently read a poem I really like.

364
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,780
I copied it down.

365
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,100
Let me read it for you.

366
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,950
[Between my lover and me,
300 long nights]

367
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,700
[will be erected like 300 high walls.]

368
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,200
[And the sea]

369
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:33,470
[will be a magic show between us.]

370
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,970
[The cruel hand of time]

371
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,800
[will tear apart]

372
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,220
[the streets
that pierce my chest like thorns.]

373
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,910
[There will be nothing left]

374
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,220
[but memories.]

375
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,420
[The dusk is given by sadness.]

376
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,460
[The night that longs for you.]

377
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,370
[The decadent wilderness.]

378
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,930
[The poor sky is]

379
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,850
[humiliated]

380
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,070
[in the bottom of the puddles]

381
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,000
[like]

382
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,470
[a fallen angel.]

383
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,110
[And your life that graces my desire.]

384
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,970
[And that desolate]

385
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,720
[and lighthearted neighborhood]

386
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,620
[shining today
in the glow of my love.]

387
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,820
[Final as a statue,]

388
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,460
[your absence]

389
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,570
[will sadden other fields.]

390
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,740
Nan Ya.

391
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,340
Nan Ya?

392
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,780
Nan Ya!

393
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,860
I know you're inside.

394
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,700
Go home now.

395
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
Nan Ya.

396
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,140
I'm coming.

397
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,020
Wait a minute.

398
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,540
What are you trying to do?

399
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,740
I saw the light is still on,

400
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,300
so you must still be in.

401
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,220
What are you here for?

402
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,020
Let's talk inside.

403
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,420
Go in and talk.

404
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,580
Such exquisite children's clothing.

405
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,820
In Qingshui town,

406
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,340
you have the best sewing skills.

407
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,460
Just get to the point.

408
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,380
Nan Ya.

409
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,220
I know you hate me.

410
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,780
What happened at the train station

411
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,020
was all Xu Yi's idea.

412
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,580
We were told to act along with him.

413
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,460
You know that

414
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,420
our family's livelihood depends on him.

415
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,540
We can't fight against him, right?

416
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,260
Actually,

417
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,140
Hu Xiu told Xu Yi
about your plan to leave

418
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,260
long ago.

419
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,140
Even if we hadn't put on the act,

420
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,620
you still wouldn't have
been able to leave.

421
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,900
I know.

422
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,700
What I did that day was despicable.

423
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,180
If you can't let it go,

424
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,940
how about this?

425
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,580
Hit me. You can hit me.

426
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,500
If it makes you feel better,

427
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,660
I'm willing to take it.
Go on and hit me.

428
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,620
Let go.

429
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,780
Nan Ya, I know

430
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,420
that you've suffered a lot.

431
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,340
You hate Xu Yi.

432
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,460
So do we.

433
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,300
I think we're in the same boat now.

434
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,620
Right?

435
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,220
You received a lot of benefits
from Xu Yi.

436
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,500
Why would you hate him?

437
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,740
What benefits?

438
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,420
We didn't even receive one cent.

439
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,180
He and Liu Changshui got all the money.

440
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,180
Now that something's happened,

441
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,100
he wants Xu Jian
to take the fall for him.

442
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,540
You know very well

443
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,820
what kind of person Xu Yi is.

444
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,900
Could you please persuade him,

445
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,580
since we are all relatives?

446
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,940
After all, blood is thicker than water,

447
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,980
am I right?

448
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,220
It's really up to Xu Jian.

449
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,740
If he didn't want to go,
what could Xu Yi have done?

450
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,500
You don't get it.

451
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,140
The company Xu Yi used

452
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
to manage this construction project

453
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,180
was registered
under my brother-in-law's name.

454
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,380
If Xu Jian was spared jail,

455
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,900
my brother-in-law
would have to go to jail.

456
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,140
Why should I help you?

457
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,340
You...

458
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,820
What did you say?

459
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,820
I said, why should I help you?

460
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,860
Nan Ya.

461
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,620
I know you have a good heart.

462
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,340
I have two children at home.

463
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,980
I only came to you

464
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,300
because I have no other options.

465
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,500
If Xu Jian is arrested,

466
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,220
how are my kids and I going to live?

467
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,420
Please, I'm begging you.

468
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,940
That day when you were putting on a show
at the train station,

469
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,020
did you think
about how Wanwan and I would live?

470
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,140
I deserve this!

471
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,980
I'm so bad!

472
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm on my knees now
to ask for your forgiveness.

473
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,220
Just say it.

474
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,060
I'll do everything you wish.

475
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,980
Then go and tell Xu Yi

476
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,500
that I want a divorce.

477
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,420
You know this is impossible.

478
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,100
If you won't do it,

479
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,860
then forget it.

480
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,780
It's not that I don't want to.

481
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,380
But is absolutely impossible for you

482
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
to divorce Xu Yi.

483
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,300
He'd rather

484
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,940
be called the pitiful husband
with a cheating wife.

485
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,140
What do you think it's for?

486
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,220
I'll be frank with you.

487
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,420
He went to Jiang Zhi

488
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,220
and got all the evidence
of his abuse destroyed.

489
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,260
Even if you go to the hospital
to ask for records,

490
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,580
there won't be anything.

491
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,580
And you can forget
about winning a lawsuit against him.

492
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,900
If that's the case,

493
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,660
let's settle it with money.

494
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,420
How much do you want?

495
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,940
Not much.

496
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,180
500,000 yuan.

497
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,300
500,000 yuan?

498
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,940
That's daylight robbery!

499
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
How am I supposed
to find this much money?

500
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,780
Since you're not willing
to spend money either,

501
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,620
you may leave now.

502
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,980
See yourself out.

503
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,500
Nan Ya.

504
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,940
How about this?

505
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,260
Report Xu Yi to the police.

506
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,300
If he goes to jail,

507
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,820
you'll be free.

508
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,100
Do you have proof?

509
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,100
Yes.

510
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,460
I know there's a ledger.

511
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,820
Then why don't you report him?

512
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,780
The ledger is with Xu Yi.

513
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,020
If you can steal it out,

514
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,500
I'll help you report him.

515
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,020
It's been a long time
since I've met someone

516
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,700
who thinks they can win
without any investment.

517
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,940
500,000 yuan.

518
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,060
Not even one cent less.

519
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,780
Turns out you're just like Xu Yi,

520
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,220
the same greedy crooks.

521
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,740
Cheap wench, you deserved the beating.

522
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,500
Your man should have just
beaten you to death.

523
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
So obsessed with money.

524
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,140
You should be content
with all the money Xu Yi has.

525
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,180
But you go out
and fool around with other men.

526
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,140
Shameless!

527
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,220
Why are you still here?

528
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,380
I worried you'd get bullied.

529
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,460
I'm not a pushover.

530
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,700
You should go.

531
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,060
Open the door.

532
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,940
Open up!

533
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,460
Nan Ya!

534
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,380
Nan Ya!

535
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,420
Open the door!

536
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,500
Hurry up!

537
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,620
Open the door!

538
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,060
The wholesale market, right?

539
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,340
I'll deliver it for you.

540
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,740
No, don't. It's a crowded place.
People will see you.

541
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,540
There won't be many cars at this hour.

542
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,060
You wait here for the bus.

543
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,620
I'll take this there on my bike.

544
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,660
You don't have to.

545
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,540
It's fine.

546
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,540
I'll just take it
to the market's entrance. I won't go in.

547
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,180
I'll wait for you

548
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,260
at the alley around the corner.

549
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,980
Just wait for the bus here.
See you in a bit.

550
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,900
Over here.

551
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,980
I'll reward you later.

552
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,140
What would you like?

553
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,540
Delivering and folding clothes.

554
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,900
I'll take 100 yuan.

555
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,980
Why do you need 100 yuan?

556
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,380
The pocket money my mom gives me
isn't enough.

557
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,260
Well, you can push it in.

558
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
I'll go and deliver it, then.

559
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,940
Careful.

560
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,060
Got it.

561
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,140
Nan Ya.

562
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm surprised with your speed.

563
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,180
With your handiwork and quality,

564
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,940
I feel kind of sorry for you.

565
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,980
It's not much money.

566
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,740
I hope you won't feel underpaid.

567
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
But rest assured.

568
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,020
We'll have more opportunities.

569
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,580
Next time, I'll get you a better price.

570
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,300
Thank you.

571
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:26,980
You're welcome.

572
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
Okay, I'll be off.

573
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,500
Okay.

574
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,300
I'll take this.

575
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,060
Sure.

576
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,780
Where have you been?

577
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,020
Just looking around.

578
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,940
You just have to spend
every penny you have, huh?

579
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,340
This is a wholesale market.

580
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,980
I know the bosses here.

581
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,700
Tell me if there's something you like.

582
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,540
Having looked around the whole place,

583
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,900
I didn't find anything that I liked.

584
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,060
Anyway, there's some time left.

585
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,940
Are you busy?

586
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,220
Why?

587
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Let me take you to a place.

588
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,060
Where?

589
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,820
Where are we going?

590
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,740
Just come.

591
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,940
Sit.

592
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,940
I've been here many times.

593
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,380
But I didn't know
there was a trail like this.

594
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,100
I found this path

595
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,260
when I was running around on my own.

596
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,180
When I was younger,

597
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,660
we would climb over the back hill

598
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,700
to avoid the entrance fee.

599
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,180
But there are fewer people on this side,

600
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,380
so it's quieter.

601
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,380
I come here for a break
when I'm feeling down.

602
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,380
So this is the road

603
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,380
less taken.

604
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,180
You remember.

605
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,860
I shall be telling this with a sigh,

606
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,060
somewhere ages and ages hence.

607
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,940
Two roads diverged
in a yellow wood, and I...

608
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,060
I took the one less traveled by.

609
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,500
And that has made all the difference.

610
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,460
The road less taken is often harder.

611
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,060
But I had read

612
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,940
an article.

613
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,740
It said

614
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,860
that we shouldn't choose
the easier road.

615
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,220
Instead,
we should choose the correct road,

616
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,860
no matter how arduous it is.

617
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,820
Where did you get the camera?

618
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,180
This is Jiang Bingbing's.

619
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,700
Previously, I borrowed this from her

620
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,140
when I was following Xu Yi.
And I haven't returned it.

621
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,420
Zhou Luo.

622
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,380
Xu Yi is a dangerous man.

623
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,620
You have to learn
how to protect yourself.

624
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,180
I know.

625
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,060
It's a little windy now.

626
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Put this on.

627
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,500
Where did you get the scarf from?

628
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,900
I bought it just now.

629
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, there's one more.

630
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,580
It's for Wanwan.

631
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,300
You used the money I gave you
to buy me gifts?

632
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,940
It's my money.

633
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,180
I worked for it.

634
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,220
Well, I have a gift for you too.

635
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,780
Do I also have a gift?

636
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,740
What is it?

637
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,580
"Stray Birds".

638
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,500
Make life as gorgeous as summer flowers

639
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,500
and death as quiet and beautiful
as autumn leaves.

640
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:03,980
Thanks.
