00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,100
If it's the fate that we met,

3
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,820
does that mean our breakup
was predestined as well?

4
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,220
I always wanted to film a love story.

5
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,780
A simple love story.

6
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,940
For example, why did this girl

7
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,660
get together with this guy

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,940
rather than that guy.

9
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,980
And she might be married to another guy

10
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,860
after a few years?

11
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,380
The definition of love

12
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,500
is never clear.

13
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,580
Relationships between humans

14
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,940
may look natural and simple.

15
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,060
But are they truly simple?

What do you say

18
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,660
why it's so easy

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,100
for two people who love each other

20
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,420
to miss out on each other?

21
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,260
So,

22
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,300
you have to spend
a lot of effort pursuing him

23
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,140
if you encounter someone you like.

24
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Bingbing,

25
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,220
I have a question.

26
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,380
Do you think

27
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,060
men like women to be mature

28
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,100
or pure?

29
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,780
They like mature women
when they're young.

30
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,140
But they definitely
like pure women when they're old.

Goodbye.

34
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,660
Goodbye.

35
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,180
Zhou Luo likes mature women.

36
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,660
How do you know?

37
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,940
I could tell that you
were trying to figure him out.

38
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,860
But I think Zhou Luo

39
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,900
is no ordinary person.

40
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,060
What do you mean?

41
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,020
Think about it.

42
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,540
If it were someone else,

43
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,220
when a pretty girl

44
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,780
was nice to him,

45
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,060
he would've fallen for her easily.

46
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,780
Zhou Luo is different.

47
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,420
He's always serious.

48
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,980
It's not easy to understand
what he's thinking.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,060
By the way,

50
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
has he

51
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,220
ever done that

52
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,180
to you?

53
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,460
What do you mean?

54
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,100
Just something

55
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,900
intimate.

56
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,580
I don't know.

57
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,540
It's...

58
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,140
Maybe he's got

59
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,060
a little bit of a crush on me.

60
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,100
That's more than enough.

61
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,660
Think about it. Zhou Luo

62
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,180
is all about studying.

63
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,260
I'm sure he has no idea

64
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,420
how to take the next step.

65
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,660
At this moment,

66
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,380
you need to give him a push.

67
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,980
How?

68
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,420
Are you silly?

69
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,340
Listen.

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,740
First, it's about the way
you look at him.

71
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,700
You need to exude tenderness
and love through your eyes

72
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,060
Exuding tenderness
and love through eyes?

73
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,140
Second,

74
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,820
you need to be nice to him

75
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
when he's at his most vulnerable.

76
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,220
How do you know about all these?

77
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,420
My cousin told me about it.

78
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,380
He said he would
hold his wedding banquet

79
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,940
after next year's exam.

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,220
The most infuriating one
is Yang Xiaochuan.

81
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,620
He's totally different from us now.

82
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,340
He's so cocky now.

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,300
Bingbing and I
aren't in a relationship yet.

84
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,140
It's so infuriating.

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,900
Sure.

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,300
I think you're different

98

from the others in town.

99
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,500
How am I different?

100
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,020
I could tell

101
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,660
from the way you treat Nan Ya.

102
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,500
You're not bound
by conventional thinking.

103
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,700
You respect girls a lot.

104
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,940
You never talk about people
behind their backs.

105
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,220
And you can even stand up for people

106
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,780
at crucial moments.

107
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,020
I don't feel like talking about that.

108
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,420
Let's finish this quickly and head back.

Are you here to buy new clothes?

112
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,900
One of my dresses doesn't fit me.

113
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Can you alter it for me?

114
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,460
Let me take your measurements.

115
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,260
Give me your dress.

Nan Ya,

117
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm sure plenty of people
were chasing you in the past.

118
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Maybe that was true
when I was a student.

119
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,820
If so,

120
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm sure the person you fancied
must have fancied you too.

121
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,060
Not necessarily.

122
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,220
Love is the subtlest thing

123
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,500

124
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,220

is so hard to figure out.

128
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,500
Sometimes, I think he's close to me.

129
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,340
Sometimes, I think he's so far away.

130
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
It's like he's running hot and cold.

131
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,820
What would you do

132
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,940
if you were in my shoes?

133
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,100
I would do my best.

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,460
But I also know

135
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,420
I might suffer
from not getting what I want.

It talked about a beautiful woman
who was very capable.

145
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,780
She could sew at the age of 13

146

and make clothes at the age of 14.

147
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,260
She got married to a...

I don't really understand the questions

149

No!

172
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,820
Give it to me!

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,180
No, I won't! Mom made this for me!

174
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,620
My mother said
your mother was a bad woman!

175
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,460
That's not true! That's nonsense!

176
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,900
Your mother is a bad woman!

177
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,180
Why are you kids acting like this?

178
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,260
How could you guys
be so rude at such a young age?

179
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,100
If you say that again,

180
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,300
I'll grab some bugs

181
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,100
and put them one by one in your shirts.

182
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,260
Wanwan, everything's fine now.

183
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,540
Tell me

184
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,620
if they bully you again.

185
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,900
I'll teach them a lesson.

186
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,020
Mom said

187
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,020
we won't be bullied again

188
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,860
when we go to the new place.

189
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,220

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,140
Where is it?

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,180
It's the place
where Mom is going to take me.

192
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,740
You have to keep this a secret.

193
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,020
I'm only telling you about this.

194
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,860
Mom said this was a secret.

195
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,660
I shouldn't tell anyone about it.

196
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,860
What about your dad, then?

197
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,860
I have to keep this from my dad.

198
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,900
Nan Ya!

199
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,820
[ZIJIN]

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,820
Zhou Luo, what are you up to again?

201
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,300
Why didn't you open the door for me?

202
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,460
I've told you not to look for me again.

203
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,420
Are you leaving?

204
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
Can you please stop behaving like this?

205
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,940
Wanwan already told me about it.

206
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,420
Where else can I go?

207
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,860
Do you intend to leave
without bidding farewell?

208
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,620
Do you intend to broadcast it
with a loudspeaker?

209
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,660
So, I am nothing to you.

210
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,700
You're just a kid.

211
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,580
I'm not!

212
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,580
If you are not, then you'll
make allowance for my hardship.

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,420
Then you'll know I have no other choice.

214
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
You will know

215
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,380
why I have to

216
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,300
escape with my sickly daughter

217
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,980
under such circumstances?

218
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,380
Is going to court
and getting a divorce that difficult?

219
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,100
I can't afford to lose Wanwan.

220
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,660
Running away is my best choice.

221
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,100
Do you intend to hide your name,
not get a divorce,

222
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,820
and lead a sneaky life?

223
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,300
Even so, it's much better
than my current life.

224
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,140
Where are you going?

225
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,260
How can I find you?

226
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,660
Stop asking. I won't tell you anything.

227
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,780
Do you know about my feelings for you?

228
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,860
Zhou Luo,

229
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,100
you have a great future ahead of you.

230
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,380
You'll lead a carefree

231
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,260
and bright life.

232
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,500
You don't mean that.

233
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,060
You don't mean that at all.

234
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,660
Tell me your address.

235
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Stop asking.

236
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,460
I won't tell you anything.

237
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,540
Why?

238
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,380
Can you wait for me?
I'll be more mature.

239
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,740
I'll get into university soon.
I can change my occupation.

240
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,780
I can find gainful employment.

241
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,820
I...

242
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,780
Just you trust me, okay?

243
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,780
I trust you.

244
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,420
But I hope
that you'll choose an occupation

245
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
that you like.

246
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,420
Can I see you off, then?

247
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,900
No.

248
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,460
My life is already terrible enough.

249
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't wish to drag other people down.

250
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,660
Don't go.

251
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,820
Children forget things easily.

252
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,420
Falling for someone
is just like catching a severe cold.

253
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,980
Go back, take a bath, and go to sleep.

254
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,980
You'll be fine after one week.

255
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,220
Are you not going
to give me any hope at all?

256
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,460
Hope is the most terrifying thing.

257
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,780
Nan Ya, do you believe in love?

258
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,740
I know it sounds stupid.

259
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,660
A person who has never
truly loved someone

260
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,980
is trying to discuss with a woman
whom he has no chance to be with

261
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,140
about love.

262
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,020
But I know

263
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,900
that this feeling inside me

264
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
cannot be suppressed or cast aside.

265
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,980
It's just like a piece of burning coal.

266
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,220
It hurts.

267
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,100
It hurts a lot
if I'm not careful enough.

268
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,740
I might be happy at this moment
but down at the next moment.

269
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,940
That should be love.

270
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,020
I wish to get close to you,

271
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,260
but I cannot.

272
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,540
I wish to push you aside,
but I can't bear to do so.

273
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,020
You said you were older than me.

274
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,900
Tell me what it is, then.

275
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,500
I know I shouldn't
say things like these.

276
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,900
But you won't get to hear them

277
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,220
if I don't say them out right now.

278
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,260
My days in the hospital

279
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,460
were the happiest moments of my life.

280
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,340
Wanwan, let's go.

281
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,900
Zhou Luo.

282
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,260
Let's go.

283
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,820
Let's go.

284
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,220
You said you were going to leave,
and I can do nothing about it.

285
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Even

286
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
the words that I say
to try to make you stay

287
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,300
seem powerless.

288
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,020
They even seem childish and selfish.

289
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,500
I know.

290
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,340
Escaping from this place is the only way

291
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,180
for you to get rid
of your life here.

292
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,500
I hate myself for being too young.
I can't take on the responsibility

293
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,180
of protecting you and Wanwan.

294
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,700
I can't provide you with anything.

295
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,260
I have nothing.

296
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,540
I'm even afraid that my love for you
might be a burden to you.

297
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,060
This feeling

298
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
almost kills me.

299
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,700
It extinguishes
the burning piece of coal in my heart.

300
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,060
But it leaves a hole behind.

301
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,060
Zhou Luo!

302
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,100
This hole

303
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,820
hurts much more than the burning piece
of coal in my heart.

304
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,340
The most helpless thing about love

305
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,300
is that there's no way to prove it.

306
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,300
Even if I show you my heart,

307
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,740
what you will see
is just a beating organ.

308
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,700
Science might have proven
the existence of hormones,

309
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,020
but love

310
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,060
is formless.

311
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,740
It's just like a spirit.

312
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,700
Only those who were possessed by it

313
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,340
could feel its existence.

314
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,220
Now, I wish to abandon everything

315
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,900
and get on that train,

316
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,460
no matter where it's heading.

317
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,820
But I know

318
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,460
that it'll only annoy you.

319
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,340
It'll overwhelm you.

320
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,260
I might even become a part

321
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,660
of your obstacles too.

322
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,340
That's why be patient
is the only thing I can do now.

323
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,060
I'll do my best
to prepare for everything.

324
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,580
Wait here for me.

325
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,660
Excuse me.
I'm here to retrieve my baggage.

326
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,740
Even if there's no hope,

327
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,220
I've still made up my mind.

328
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,500
Nan Ya,

329
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,300
I will wait for you.

330
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,020
I will always wait for you.

331
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,220
No matter where you are,

332
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,260
there will always be someone
who trembles upon hearing your name.

333
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,220
Until you're willing to turn around

334
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,220
and look at me.

335
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,940
Until

336
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,540
the day we meet again.

337
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,260
What does the city
we're going to look like?

338
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,900
That is

339
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,100
a very beautiful city.

340
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,420
There are plenty of flowers there.

341
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,340
It's very warm too.

342
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,100
Are you happy?

343
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,940
Yeah.

344
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,860
Nan Ya.

345
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,180
Don't move.

346
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,260
Don't move!

347
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:13,820
Xu Jian!

348
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,660
What are you doing?

349
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,860
They're over here! Get them!

350
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,500
What are you doing?

351
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,580
Mom!

352
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,340
What are you guys doing?

353
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,420
Wanwan!

354
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,980
Let go of me! Wanwan!

355
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,900
How dare you bully me?

356
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,660
You're too bold!
How dare you try to escape?

357
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,900
I'll beat you to death!

358
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,980
Let go of me! Mom!

359
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Xu Jian!

360
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,220
You scum!

361
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
How dare you seduce your brother's wife?

362
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Let go of me!

363
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,020
What are you guys doing?

364
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,900
Let go of me!

365
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,780
What are you looking at?

366
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,180
Go away!

367
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,140
Leave!

368
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,300
Go!

369
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,100
Xu Jian! You scum! Get out of the van!

370
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,140
You scum! Get out of the van!

371
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,860
Get her down!

372
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,940
What are you guys doing?

373
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,700
Get out of the van! Go inside!

374
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,540
Xu Jian, you scum!

375
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,820
How did I treat you usually?

376
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,300
How could you face our ancestors?

377
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,380
You shameless scum!

378
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,860
What's going on over there?

379
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,620
Why are they all going there?

380
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,780
Let's go and check it out too.

381
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,260
Okay.

382
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,580
How did I treat you usually?

383
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,500
Look at how you're treating me!

384
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,780
Why did I trust you in the first place?

385
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,660
How could you guys face our ancestors?

386
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,180
Are you okay?

387
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,980
I'm fine.

388
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,380
Don't talk. The act will be over soon.

389
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,980
Get down.

390
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,300
Explain yourself!

391
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,860
How could I have not known

392
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,020
about your affair with Xu Jian?

393
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
Wanwan!

394
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Wanwan!

395
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,500
Wanwan!

396
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,940
Go home!

397
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,580
Mom!

398
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,780
Luo!

399
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,540
What's going on?

400
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,300
Mom, take Wanwan back.
Don't let her see this.

401
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,260
Come back quickly!

402
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,300
Zhou Luo!

403
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,220
What are you doing?

404
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,140
Have you lost your mind?

405
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,060
Let go of me!

406
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,340
Did you forget what happened?

407
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,100
I'm going to kill him!

408
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,020
You'll only ruin your reputation
if you go there now!

409
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,060
I don't care!

410
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,380
Is it worth it
ruining your reputation for a woman?

411
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,740
Can't you tell that they're acting?

412
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,260
That's not the case at all!

413
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,260
Zhou Luo!

414
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Calm down.

415
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,020
Qingli and Bingbing
have already called the police.

416
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380
The police will be here soon.

417
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,300
If you go there now,
you'll end up like Xu Jian.

418
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,620
You'll be implicated too!

419
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,380
Can't you tell that no man
is trying to get implicated here?

420
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,260
Make way!

421
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,940
Zhou Luo!

422
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,540
Zhou Luo, calm down!

423
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,380
Make way!

424
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,260
You scum!

425
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,460
How could you do this to me?

426
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,820
Zhou Luo!

427
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,340
Zhou Luo!

428
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,580
Do you want to swim?

429
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,220
The water is very cold.

430
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,060
Does it hurt?

431
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,060
It doesn't hurt now.

432
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,620
I hate them.

433
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,140
Is there a point in hating them?

434
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,460
No.

435
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,820
But I feel like killing them today.

436
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
Me too.

437
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,220
But I won't do it.

438
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,060
I still have Wanwan.

439
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
What exactly do you want from me?

440
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,100
I don't want anything from you.

441
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,180
The world is never that simple.

442
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,060
Don't you trust me?

443
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,540
I'm telling you to trust no one,

444
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,100
including me.

445

corrupt, and inhumane]
