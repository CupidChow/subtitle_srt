00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,970
[Episode 10]

2
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,180
She isn't my daughter.

3
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,860
My family doesn't have such a daughter.

4
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,860
She's been ruthless
since she was little.

5
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,580
I don't regard her as my family.

6
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,780
People can gossip all they like.

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,660
She was the one

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,620
who purposely froze her father to death.

9
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
She would open the door
for him every day.

10
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,100
But

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,820
when it was snowing that day,

12
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
she didn't open the door.

13
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
Poor Xu Yi.

14
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,980
Nan Ya must have someone else.

15
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,580
She played him like a fiddle.

16
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,780
On Millennial Night,

17
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,540
he just discovered it.

18
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,420
He even lost his life.

19
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,740
Dragons soaring, you thriving!

20
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,540
Mom, look. Dragon.

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,140
Is it pretty?

22
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,380
Yes.

23
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,580
Come on, let's go down to see it.

24
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,260
Okay.

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,820
Who are you trying
to seduce in this outfit?

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,580
Wanwan, why don't you go
and look for Guixiang first?

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,660
Okay.

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Just because I haven't said anything
all these years doesn't mean I agree.

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,180
Listen.

30
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,220
The house you live in
belongs to the Nan Family.

31
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,020
Why are you ruining my mood
on such a good day?

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,700
Who said it belongs to your family?

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,180
Nan Zhong left it to me.

34
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,460
Left it to you?

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,140
Did my dad write a suicide note?

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,260
How could it be yours?

37
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,660
He said it many times.

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,460
Since he's dead,
then the house is his inheritance.

39
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,740
Looks like you know nothing
about the law.

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,540
If it's an inheritance,
I get half of it.

41
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,180
Even if you want to sell that house,

42
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
you'll have
to give me half of the money.

43
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,300
Mark my words.

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,580
You're old, and you'll die ahead of me.

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,140
I won't sell the house.

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,420
Don't think
about getting a dime from me!

47
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,420
You must sell it now.

48
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,700
Whether I get the money or not,

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,780
the court will have a fair verdict.

50
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,500
Unless I die!

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
If my son Hu Lifan were still alive,

52
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,660
I would ask him to rip you to shreds!

53
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,100
She is that kind of person
who would kill people.

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,740
Whoever gets involved with her

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,660
will become unlucky.

56
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,580
I raised an ungrateful woman.

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,900
Now, she wants
to seize the house from me.

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm still alive!

59
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,940
Wish you an auspicious beginning
of a new year.

60
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,140
Peace all year round.

61
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,580
Wanwan.

62
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,220
What are you doing here?

63
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm here to see Wanwan.

64
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,500
Are you running out of money?

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,940
No, I think

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,460
something's off with Nan Ya.

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,580
She must have been
in need of money recently.

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,460
Be careful not to be tricked by her.

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,340
She wants to sell my house,

70
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,260
and she said she would hire a lawyer
for a lawsuit against me.

71
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,580
Your family is rich.

72
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,260
But she's rushing
to seize the house from me.

73
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Maybe it's because she has an affair.

74
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,020
She also said she would divorce you.

75
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,900
She says that every day.

76
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,340
This time, she's kept it well hidden.

77
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Don't you see
she's been pretty happy lately?

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,580
She's already thirty,

79
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,220
but she looks gorgeous.

80
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,820
Her face is shining with joy.

81
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,780
Clearly, she is seeing someone else.

82
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,700
Many people say
that she's having an affair.

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,220
Why can't you see it?

84
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,140
Xiu, what happened?

85
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,540
What's wrong?

86
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,300
Are you not feeling well?

87
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,940
What's wrong?

88
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:33,900
I'm not feeling well.

89
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Hu Xiu, what's wrong?

90
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,900
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

91
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,620
Slowly...

92
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,100
Come on.

93
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,300
Come on, let's go.

94
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,100
Be careful.

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,020
Come on.

96
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,140
Please make way!

97
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,580
Be careful.

98
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,740
Make way...

99
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,340
Nurse.

100
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,540
I need to use the toilet.

101
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,100
Grudges are not easily resolved.

102
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,620
Chen Ling even cried out of anger.

103
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,100
It makes me sick to talk to her.

104
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,180
She even wishes me to die ahead of her.

105
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,340
Don't even think about it!

106
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,260
A life for a life,

107
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,020
right?

108
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,660
She must have wanted

109
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,780
to kill Xu Yi for a long time.

110
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,780
After killing him, she'll get money.

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,780
She'll leave

112
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,980
with that man and Wanwan.

113
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,100
Have you found out

114
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,620
who that man is?

115
00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:02,050
[Tender Light]

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,340
Why are Zhou Luo and Liu Xun fighting?

117
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,740
Didn't you see the posters on the wall?

118
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,580
Liu Xun told everyone

119
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,020
Zhou Luo got involved
with his teacher at university.

120
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,100
That was why he got expelled.

121
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,060
Really?

122
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,580
Yes, the photos were all posted.

123
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,620
It must be true.

124
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,300
I think Liu Xun is jealous of Zhou Luo.

125
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Who knows how he got the photos?

126
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,700
Sir.

127
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,260
What's going on?

128
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Sir, they are fighting!

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,100
Sir, what should we do?

130
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Sir.

131
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,620
Those two boys.

132
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,380
How dare

133
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,620
they fight in front of the principal?

134
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,580
Make way...

135
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,020
Stop fighting...

136
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,620
What's going on?

137
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,300
Sir.

138
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,020
Don't go there.

139
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,620
I've called the police, sir.

140
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,820
Why did you call the police?

141
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,980
Stop!

142
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,460
Stop!

143
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,620
Our teacher has already
called the police!

144
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,700
It's dangerous, kid.

145
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,260
Zhou Luo, stop it.

146
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,220
If you dare, come at me.

147
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
What kind of man would
play sneaky tricks behind others' backs?

148
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,540
Stop fighting.

149
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,460
The police are here.

150
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,820
Stop fighting. The police are here.

151
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,420
The police are here.

152
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,260
Stop fighting.

153
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,820
What are you doing?

154
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,500
Make way, don't move!

155
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:25,980
Stop fighting!

156
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,540
Don't move!

157
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
What's going on?

158
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,020
Why did you fight?

159
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,100
Did you make this?

160
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,780
No.

161
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,180
Why do you think it was him?

162
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,540
He stole my teacher's letter.

163
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,420
No, I didn't.

164
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,340
You're lying!

165
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,860
I can testify.

166
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,740
I saw it.

167
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,500
We saw it, too.

168
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,620
You're a gang.

169
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,340
Besides you, did others see it?

170
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,220
I didn't see it.

171
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,180
I didn't see it either.

172
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,700
We saw it.

173
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,580
You're lying.

174
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,700
I saw it.

175
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,900
Enough! Stop fighting!

176
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,260
What are you doing?

177
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,860
What are you doing?

178
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,620
Have you lost your mind?

179
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,340
What are you pointing at?

180
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
I will slap you to death!

181
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,580
Stand there!

182
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,900
Listen.

183
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,180
Stop fighting

184
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,460
or I'll take you all
to the police station.

185
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,420
Anyway, I didn't make this poster.

186
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,860
I'm injured.

187
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,620
My head is bleeding.

188
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,900
I want to sue Zhou Luo
for intentional harm.

189
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,140
If you want to arrest someone,
arrest him first.

190
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,980
It's a gang fight.

191
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,300
We'll have to arrest you all.

192
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,100
It was Zhou Luo who started it.

193
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,340
I'm the victim.

194
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,060
We don't care.

195
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,940
As long as it's a gang fight,

196
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,900
we'll arrest all the people involved.

197
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,860
I think

198
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,540
there's no need

199
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
to arrest them.

200
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,820
Why not?

201
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
They are all above eighteen.

202
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,260
Liu Xun,

203
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,220
do you still want to go to university?

204
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,940
If you don't want to,

205
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,220
you can quit today.

206
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,620
Chen.

207
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,100
It's just a conflict
among the students

208
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,020
that hasn't been handled well.

209
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,580
The responsibility

210
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,740
is all on me.

211
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,540
Zhou Luo

212
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,700
usually

213
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,860
has good grades.

214
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,540
He's just a bit of a maverick.

215
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,860
Liu Xun

216
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,660
is also a good student.

217
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,780
He's a class officer
who's in charge of studies.

218
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,940
Their characters

219
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,420
are all fine.

220
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,540
However,

221
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,820
they are repeat students.

222
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,140
If they get arrested,

223
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,500
it might affect their exam.

224
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,340
Chen,

225
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,100
why don't you...

226
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,060
Chen,

227
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,660
judging from the situation,

228
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,300
this is just a fight.

229
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,340
Maybe we should have them
write reflections.

230
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,260
But

231
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,540
they must write good reflections

232
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,460
and reflect upon their own mistakes.

233
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,780
They cannot fight like this
in the future.

234
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,660
Of course.

235
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,820
They will write reflections.

236
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,020
Not only that,

237
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,860
they will also resolve their conflicts.

238
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Understand?

239
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,860
Understand?

240
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,260
Yes.

241
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:03,950
[Breaking News: Intimate Lover]

242
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,260
Liu Xun.

243
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,940
Come down.

244
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,780
I'll get in the car.

245
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,300
Come here.

246
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,540
Get over here!

247
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,500
The posters on the wall.

248
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,540
You printed them, right?

249
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,060
Do you hate Zhou Luo?

250
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,100
I hate to see him

251
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,740
acting all arrogant.

252
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,580
He's pretentious.

253
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,860
Are there any other reasons?

254
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,660
He was the top scorer of the county.

255
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,020
After a few years, he quit
and came back to retake the exam.

256
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,180
If he hadn't made any severe mistakes,

257
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,540
the university
wouldn't have expelled him.

258
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,100
Well, what does that
have to do with you?

259
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,500
Look how things have ended up.

260
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,060
I went to his university
and asked around.

261
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,900
The students there said

262
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,180
it was a sex scandal.

263
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,020
He got involved with a female teacher

264
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,820
in her forties.

265
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,100
Why are you crying?

266
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm not crying.

267
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,540
Remove the posters on the wall later.

268
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,460
You hear me?

269
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:27,940
Come on, Chen Jun.

270
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,380
This meal is on me.

271
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,700
You should treat us.

272
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,260
After helping you fight,

273
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,020
she's ignored me until now.

274
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,140
Thank you.

275
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,580
Actually, I've been

276
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,380
keeping a secret from you,

277
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,500
but I'll tell you guys today.

278
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,420
What is it?

279
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,100
You can continue to keep it a secret.

280
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,700
We don't have to know it.

281
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,060
Yes, it must be difficult to say.

282
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,820
It's okay. I will tell you

283
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,580
the real reason
I quit the university in Shanghai.

284
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,420
You're all my best friends.

285
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,620
I think

286
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,180
I should tell you about it.

287
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,420
What are you doing?

288
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,940
You scared me.

289
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,180
You also scared me.

290
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,780
What are you looking for?

291
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,740
I don't know.

292
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,580
If you don't know,
then why are you looking for something?

293
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,580
If our son sees this,
he'll be angry with you.

294
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,660
You'll get sad again.

295
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,900
I won't let him know. I will be careful.

296
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,380
You've

297
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,740
been acting strange lately.

298
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,340
Did your menopause come earlier?

299
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,020
You're the one having menopause.

300
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't you think

301
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,500
that our son has been
hiding something from us recently?

302
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,580
What can he hide?

303
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,540
You don't even believe

304
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,500
your son?

305
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,100
You women tend to overthink.

306
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,860
We've lived half a lifetime.

307
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,900
And we've encountered many hardships.

308
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,700
These several months

309
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,460
have been the hardest months for us,

310
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,180
right?

311
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,780
Things will get better
after he gets into Jinghua.

312
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,860
Let's just endure it for now.

313
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,540
I cannot endure anymore.

314
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,140
Why don't you understand?

315
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,020
I saw it.

316
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,500
What did you see?

317
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,900
The burning car.

318
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,060
Chen Jun.

319
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,580
Happy Millennium!

320
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,460
Did you make a wish?

321
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,220
Chen Jun,

322
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,180
why isn't Zhou Luo with you?

323
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,780
He's with Qingli.

324
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,380
Don't worry.

325
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,260
It's fine.

326
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,820
Okay.

327
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,340
Zhou.

328
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,060
Look.

329
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,540
That's Nan Ya and Xu Yi.

330
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,020
They are fighting over there.

331
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,500
Stay out of their business.

332
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Why are they fighting
on such a good day?

333
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,540
This is unbelievable.

334
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,340
Zhou...

335
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,700
What's going on?

336
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,180
This...

337
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,220
Take this.

338
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
I'll go find our son.

339
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,980
Hold it tight.

340
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,140
The notification letter is inside.
Don't lose it.

341
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,740
Okay...

342
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,620
Zhou Luo.

343
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,820
Zhou Luo, is it you?

344
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,660
Don't run!

345
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,500
Zhou Luo!

346
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,940
I heard Zhang Huashan
calling Zhou Luo's name.

347
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,180
I also saw a dark figure

348
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,700
running into the alley,

349
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,740
and then disappeared.

350
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,900
Did you see it clearly?

351
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,980
Was that Zhou Luo?

352
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Of course, I didn't see it clearly.

353
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,340
If you didn't see it clearly,
why are you saying all this?

354
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,940
I cannot communicate with you.

355
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,980
That day, after I went back
to the riverside,

356
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,340
Zhou Luo came back after a while.

357
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
It was freezing,

358
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,220
but his forehead was covered with sweat.

359
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,340
Even his palms were all wet.

360
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,300
It was the same back at university.

361
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,300
You weren't there when he dropped out.

362
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
I asked everyone I could for help there.

363
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,060
Until now, I still don't understand.

364
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,740
Why did he do such a foolish thing?

365
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,580
Until now,

366
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,180
I dare not ask him.

367
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,420
Actually, no matter what I ask,

368
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,900
he will not tell me the answer.

369
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,740
Zhou Luo.

370
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,340
I swear

371
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,010
I won't tell anyone

372
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,900
about it.

373
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,900
I never thought

374
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,020
you'd tell us that.

375
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,700
Trust me.

376
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,340
We won't change our opinion about you.

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,500
Same here.

378
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,420
We won't.

379
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,740
Let's drink.

380
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,980
Qingli.

381
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,580
Chen Jun.

382
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,060
I want to eat wontons.

383
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,220
I want to eat wontons.

384
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,980
It's on you today, right?

385
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,180
We'll get some wontons.

386
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,260
Let's go.

387
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,700
Mine should be spicy.

388
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,900
I know.

389
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,460
Four bowls.

390
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,020
Okay.

391
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,060
Qingli.

392
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,220
You cannot accept it?

393
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,740
I just feel bad for him.

394
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,740
Wenting,

395
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,460
do you

396
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,740
know anyone
at East Normal University in Shanghai?

397
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,740
A friend of mine is a teacher there.

398
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,460
Can you ask him

399
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,900
to help me ask around about something?

400
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,300
What is it?

401
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,940
The reason why Zhou Luo dropped out.

402
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,740
Isn't the case already closed?

403
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,900
Well,

404
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,180
I'm usually confident

405
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,540
when solving cases.

406
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,660
But this time,

407
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,020
I can't help feeling uneasy.

408
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,180
Is it because of Nan Ya?

409
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,060
Is she one

410
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,540
you liked before in Qingshui Town?

411
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,980
It has nothing to do with that.

412
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,500
Oh, it's her then.

413
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,060
However, Lin Fanglu,
l need to remind you

414
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,820
that don't get yourself caught up

415
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,220
in this cheesy romantic drama,

416
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,500
dreaming about being a hero
and saving the damsel in distress.

417
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,260
We are both very rational people.

418
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Ultimately,
we have to return to reality.

419
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,020
Step forward up here.

420
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,260
Peruse some of the faces from the past.

421
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,020
You walked past them many times

422
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,660
but never really looked at them.

423
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,260
They’re not that different
from you, are they?

424
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,020
Same haircuts.

425
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,100
Full of hormones, just like you.

426
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,940
Invincible, just like you feel.

427
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,260
The world is their oyster.

428
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,460
They believe they are destined

429
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,740
for great things.

430
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,500
Just like many of you,

431
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,020
[Breaking News: Intimate Lover]
their eyes are full of hope.

432
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,420
Just like you.

433
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,740
Did they wait until it was too late

434
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,740
to make from their lives
even one iota of what they were capable?

435
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,020
Because you see, gentlemen,

436
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,940
these boys

437
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,420
are now fertilizing daffodils.

438
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,980
Carpe...

439
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,420
Carpe diem.

440
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,420
Seize the day, boys.

441
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,500
Make your lives extraordinary.

442
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,380
You wanted to see me?

443
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,540
Ma Liang.

444
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,780
Do you recognize me?

445
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,460
Who doesn't recognize you?

446
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,740
Chen, the police.

447
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,700
You used to be the ticket clerk.

448
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,220
Now, you're the head of security.

449
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,180
You got a promotion.

450
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,060
Not really.

451
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,660
I'm a bit freer now.

452
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,140
On October 1st, 1994,

453
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,620
Xu Yi offered you a sum of money.
Do you still remember that?

454
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,180
To testify that Xu Yi and Nan Ya

455
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,940
caught the midnight movie that night.

456
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
Yeah.

457
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,580
Yes, you're right.

458
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,420
That night,

459
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,780
did they watch the movie?

460
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,700
No.

461
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,740
I remember that night,

462
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,300
no one came to see the midnight movie.

463
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,660
I didn't even play the movie.

464
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,260
Are you sure?

465
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,740
Yes.

466
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,180
Lin Fanglu.

467
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,060
Lin Fanglu.

468
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,780
Who is it?

469
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,220
It's me, Chen.

470
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,940
What's wrong?

471
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,700
Is something going on?

472
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,900
Let's go fishing by the river.

474
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,620
Are you crazy?

475
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
Fishing late at night?

476
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,500
Lin.

477
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,300
Regarding Hu Lifan's case,

478
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,020
it causes me to lose my sleep.

479
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,380
If you can't sleep, take some medicine.
Why do you come to me?

480
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,460
I don't want
to become dependent on it, okay?

481
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,900
It's fine to eat
several tablets occasionally.

482
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,660
Medicine is poisonous.

483
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,460
Let's go.

484
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,260
Come on.

485
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,500
Let me get changed.

486
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,660
Sitting by the river

487
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,380
will make you feel cool.

488
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,420
When the wind blows,

489
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,660
your mind will clear.

490
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
As police officers,

491
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,980
sometimes, when we handle a case

492
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,020
for a long time,

493
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,100
we can get deeply involved

494
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,980
and obsessed with it,

495
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,140
feeling like

496
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,660
it's our whole world.

497
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,340
Once we lose it,

498
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,980
we feel like
we lose the motivation to live.

499
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
It's like

500
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,260
solving a puzzle game.

501
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,140
You put in so much effort,

502
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,580
only to be told in the end
that there's no solution.

503
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,540
It drives you crazy.

504
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,380
That's true.

505
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,820
My mentor

506
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,380
investigated a case.

507
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
He searched for the culprit
for ten years,

508
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,380
but to no avail.

509
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,180
When he retired,

510
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,220
he broke down.

511
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,660
He had been a police officer
for thirty years

512
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,300
with numerous accomplishments,

513
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,340
but this case

514
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,780
haunted him.

515
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,460
They think

516
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,380
it's because I didn't get promoted.

517
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,980
In a place like Qingshui Town,

518
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,180
how far do you think
one can rise in their career?

519
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,060
I'm the deputy captain.

520
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,700
Even if I'm the captain,

521
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,220
I'll be doing the same thing.

522
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,820
It's impossible for me
to get promoted any further.

523
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,940
I didn't get enough education.

524
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,340
Hu Lifan's case

525
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,540
has been plaguing me.

526
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,380
We couldn't close the case
for many years.

527
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,740
Last year, we finally
caught the suspect.

528
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,820
They said he was killed
by Qiu Kuan.

529
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,860
Stop! Stop!

530
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,900
Stop!

531
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,980
Stop! Don't move! Stop!

532
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,460
Don't move!

533
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,420
Don't move!

534
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,780
Jiang Baoshan.

535
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,380
Everyone calls you

536
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,540
Rat,

537
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,620
right?

538
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,180
Where have you been
these past few years?

539
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,300
I didn't go anywhere.

540
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,900
I'm doing business with someone else.

541
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,660
Business?

542
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,780
You didn't even come back to see
your grandmother when she passed away.

543
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,700
What business are you in?

544
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,940
Killing people?

545
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,100
Trafficking drugs?

546
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,300
You've accused me wrongly.

547
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,780
I'm not involved in illegal deals.

548
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,300
You've been on the run for many years.

549
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,140
Did you forget why?

550
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,300
Let me remind you.

551
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,540
Hu Lifan.

552
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,340
I didn't kill him.

553
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,020
Didn't Qiu Kuan get shot

554
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,700
because of this?

555
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,020
You know a lot.

556
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,060
Qiu Kuan was shot.

557
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,020
He's dead and cannot defend himself.

558
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,860
Well,

559
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,540
then you can ask around and investigate.

560
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,420
Qiu Kuan's lackeys knew

561
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,900
he killed Hu Lifan personally.

562
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,060
Then why did you run away?

563
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,420
That day,

564
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,660
I did beat him up

565
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,380
severely.

566
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,820
So I thought...

567
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,060
But later, I heard

568
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
that he died

569
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,220
and his body was hidden somewhere.

570
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
That definitely wasn't me.

571
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,540
If it wasn't you,

572
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,900
why didn't you tell the police?

573
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,980
My boss killed a man.

574
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,460
I wouldn't dare say it to anyone.

575
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,460
Why did you beat him up?

576
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,420
Actually,

577
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,900
he offended Qiu

578
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,140
because of some goods.

579
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,740
He was rude,

580
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,100
so Qiu told me to teach him a lesson.

581
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,340
I brought two men

582
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,620
and beat him up.

583
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,540
We beat him badly.

584
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,900
However, I'm pretty sure

585
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,700
he was still alive when I left.

586
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,780
Where did you beat him up?

587
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,580
In an empty alley.

588
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,900
Where did you go after that?

589
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,300
The video hall.

590
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,740
What makes you say
it was Qiu Kuan who did it?

591
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,260
Did you see it?

592
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,540
Later, I went to Guangxi.

593
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,100
I happened to meet

594
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,540
someone who used
to be Qiu Kuan's lackey.

595
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,260
He told me

596
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,460
it was Boss
who killed Hu Lifan personally.

597
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,140
That night,

598
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,740
Qiu drank some alcohol

599
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,300
and said he was going out

600
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,060
to take care of someone personally.

601
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,180
A long time later,

602
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,180
he came back drunk

603
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,140
with blood all over him.

604
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,140
He also said

605
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,780
if anyone dared to go against him,

606
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,180
he'd make sure
that person would disappear.

607
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,580
Where was the body hidden?

608
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,820
I really have no idea.

609
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,180
But Boss said

610
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,340
after killing someone,

611
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,340
the body mustn't be left behind.

612
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,020
All the witnesses
who were with him that night

613
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,380
said it was Qiu Kuan who did it,

614
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,100
but my intuition told me

615
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,420
that was not the truth.

616
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,300
Intuition

617
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,180
cannot be trusted.

618
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,540
Yes.

619
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,220
If Qiu Kuan

620
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,020
hadn't killed Hu Lifan,

621
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,380
who would have he killed that night?

622
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,220
There was no report

623
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,020
or disappearance.

624
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,380
Anyway,

625
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,020
Hu Lifan

626
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,100
isn't a good person.

627
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,740
He followed Hu Xiu
to join Nan Ya's family.

628
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,020
He idled away his time
and was ignorant and incompetent.

629
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,260
However,

630
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,420
the truth must be unfolded.

631
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,740
Five years ago, after he disappeared,

632
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,340
I searched for a few days,

633
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,340
but to no avail.

634
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,780
He burned the boilers.

635
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,460
On the boiler,

636
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,620
the burnt skin, clothes,

637
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,540
and blood

638
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,740
were all removed by the coal residue.

639
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,940
The fingerprints

640
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,940
and shoe prints

641
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,220
were wiped away by the culprit.

642
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,500
Nothing was left behind.

643
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,980
Back then,

644
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
the blood
on a piece of clothing fragment

645
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,700
belonged to Jiang Baoshan.

646
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,140
He

647
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,180
was on the run

648
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,660
and the timing was right.

649
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,540
Thus, he was listed
as the prime suspect.

650
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,780
Later, it was confirmed

651
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,500
that he had an alibi.

652
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,340
It was strange.

653
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,860
Jiang Baoshan

654
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,900
did beat Hu Lifan up,

655
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,620
but Hu Xiu insisted

656
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,180
it was Nan Ya who killed her son.

657
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,500
After so many years,

658
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,540
we all know well

659
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Hu Lifan

660
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,100
is dead.

661
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,860
But no matter
whether he's alive or dead,

662
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,940
I have to see his body.

663
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,660
The culprit should be Qiu Kuan.

664
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,020
A few people testified to that.

665
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,140
Qiu Kuan

666
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,860
also told us
both directly and indirectly

667
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,140
that he killed Hu Lifan.

668
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,020
But...

669
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,460
But he was shot.

670
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,420
It must be Nan Ya, that vixen.

671
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,660
My son died a horrible death!

672
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,380
It's tough for a woman

673
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,020
to kill a man taller
and stronger than her

674
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,060
and hide the body

675
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,220
without leaving

676
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,580
any trace behind.

677
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,940
Yes.

678
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,220
No one believed that.

679
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,260
Hu Xiu

680
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,620
treated Nan Ya harshly.

681
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,500
Everyone knows that.

682
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,020
Stepmothers are evil,

683
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,260
right?

684
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,260
Many people sympathized with Nan Ya.

685
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,900
Nan Ya didn't have a motive to kill him.

686
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,340
She

687
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,580
also had an alibi.

688
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,020
What alibi?

689
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,260
What alibi?

690
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
The alibi

691
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,100
was testified by Chen Ling.

692
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,620
That night,

693
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,380
Nan Ya secretly went to seduce Xu Yi.

694
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,260
They went to watch
a midnight movie together.

695
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,980
After that, they returned to the dorm

696
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,060
and slept together until dawn.

697
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,580
Chen Ling went there
and caught them red-handed.

698
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,500
But

699
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,900
if they

700
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,700
didn't watch the midnight movie,

701
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,820
there would be two hours

702
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,940
unaccounted for.

703
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,300
Chen Ling went there at 6:40 AM.

704
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,540
Anything

705
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,660
could happen that night.

706
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,340
Besides, I asked about it.

707
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
The movie wasn't played that day.

708
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Do you feel better?

709
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,700
No.

710
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,860
My heart isn't doing well.

711
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Did you eat any medicine?

712
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,780
Yes.

713
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,980
It was all because Nan Ya pissed me off.

714
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,100
Anyway,

715
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,820
no matter what,

716
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,380
I won't die ahead of her.

717
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,180
So?

718
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,340
Will she need to pay with her life?

719
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,420
It's still under investigation.

720
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,140
But

721
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,460
she might not receive the death penalty.

722
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,540
Take one more sip.

723
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,540
We came

724
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,180
to ask

725
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,980
whether or not Hu Lifan

726
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,820
had a grudge against anyone else.

727
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,500
Did you find something?

728
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,660
I knew it. I knew something was off.

729
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,380
Was it...

730
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,460
Was it her?

731
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,740
Calm down.

732
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,380
We're just asking
about the situation back then.

733
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,460
It's not like what you think.

734
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,860
Two people died, and you won't
give her the death penalty?

735
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,180
She's not a human being.

736
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,180
She's a fox spirit.

737
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,820
She knows magic.

738
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,860
Are you crazy?

739
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,020
No.

740
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,980
Why do you think it must be Nan Ya?

741
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,340
Besides Nan Ya,

742
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,540
no one else hated my son that much.

743
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,100
Hu Lifan

744
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,020
had many enemies.

745
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,820
Nan Ya is ruthless.

746
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,740
Murder requires a motive.
You can't rely on wild guesses.

747
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,940
Being ruthless doesn't
necessarily mean having a motive, okay?

748
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,860
Chen.

749
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,500
Let's go.

750
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,860
Okay, get some rest. We're leaving.

751
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,860
Wait.

752
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,100
I can

753
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
tell you.

754
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,180
Go ahead.

755
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,740
My son

756
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,460
has been dead for years, anyway.

757
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,980
Even if you want to sentence him,

758
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,740
you couldn't find him.

759
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,660
If you could find him,
that would be even better.

760
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,860
He could go to jail
for eight or ten years.

761
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,660
At least,

762
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,220
he would be still alive.

763
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,740
When Nan Ya

764
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,100
was in high school,

765
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,100
Hu Lifan

766
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,100
slept

767
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,260
with her.

768
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,740
What did you say?

769
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,380
Make yourself clear.

770
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,740
Did he force her to do so
against her wishes?

771
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,060
It was all

772
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,860
because she went
to the school's backhill late at night?
