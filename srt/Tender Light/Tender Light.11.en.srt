193
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,300
Can I have a look inside?

194
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,380
She'll go to school
when she gets better.

195
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,660
Open the door.

196
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,460
Open the door.

197
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,660
Open the door.

198
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,380
Go in.

199
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,820
Go in.

200
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,380
Dad.

201
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,980
Go in.

202
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,580
Dad.

203
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,140
Go in!

204
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,540
Dad.

205
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,380
Open the door.

206
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,980
Ya.

207
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,700
Dad.

208
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,620
Can we not call the police?

209
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,260
So you'll just allow them

210
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,740
to bully me?

211
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,860
If you call the police,

212
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,940
your reputation will be ruined.

213
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,900
This family will be destroyed.

214
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,940
We can't fight them.

215
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,500
You know very well

216
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,020
what Hu Lifan is like.

217
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,740
He kills people when he's crazy.

218
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,580
It's horrible.

219
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,180
Open the door.

220
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,580
Open the door.

221
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,500
No way.

222
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,540
Promise me not to call the police first.

223
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,060
Then I'll open the door.

224
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,820
Okay, I promise you.

225
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,460
Open the door.

226
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,260
Ya.

227
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, right.

228
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,100
I've discussed with your stepmother.

229
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
After your graduation,

230
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,380
he'll marry you.

231
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,020
Don't even think about it.

232
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,340
I would rather die than marry him.

233
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,700
Who else can you marry?

234
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,500
Who would marry you?

235
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,660
If I were you, I would kill him!

236
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,820
Silly girl.

237
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
If I kill him,

238
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,420
I would need to pay with my life.

239
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,580
What about this family?

240
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,740
Call the police, then.

241
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,660
Didn't I tell you?

242
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,700
You can't call the police.

243
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,820
They're taking
severe measures against crime.

244
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,220
If we call the police,

245
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,340
he may be sentenced to death.

246
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,060
My child.

247
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,460
This is fate.

248
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,220
Accept it.

249
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,820
I've been there.

250
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,420
A wise man knows when to retreat.

251
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,300
It's better to be alive
than to die for a good cause.

252
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,940
Slowly.

253
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,220
I finally know

254
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,620
why Mom died so soon.

255
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,660
She was so young

256
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,980
when she died of depression.

257
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,700
It was because of you!

258
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,220
Because of you.

259
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,580
I used to think

260
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,700
that you're just useless,

261
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,220
an alcoholic

262
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,860
and not educated.

263
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,100
Now I finally know

264
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,260
that you're also a coward.

265
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,020
You don't even know how to be a father

266
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
and a husband.

267
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm not worthy.

268
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,180
I'm not worthy.

269
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,140
What do you know?

270
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,420
If she hadn't married me,

271
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,940
she wouldn't have been
able to live. Got it?

272
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,660
She should be grateful.

273
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,540
Got it?

274
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,980
What was so great about her?

275
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,980
She was just an intellectual.

276
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,260
So what?

277
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,300
Didn't she need to eat?

278
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,460
Didn't she need to sleep?

279
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,980
She lived just like a normal being.

280
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
What was so noble about her?

281
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,460
Listen.

282
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,700
Other than being pretty,

283
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,980
your mom was a good-for-nothing.

284
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,500
Dad!

285
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,740
Dad!

286
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,660
Open the door!

287
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Open the door!

288
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,740
Open the door.

289
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,980
Open the door.

290
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,100
This is a crime!

291
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,740
Do you have any evidence?

292
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,580
You just admitted your crime

293
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,300
in front of two policemen!

294
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,820
I didn't rape her.

295
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Illegal detention.

296
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,740
Shielding a criminal.

297
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,060
All these are punishable by sentence!

298
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Well, you should sentence her first!

299
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,060
I can be sentenced with her.

300
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,580
I don't have long to live after all.

301
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,540
Even so,

302
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,060
Nan Ya didn't have to kill Hu Lifan

303
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,940
after so many years.

304
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,180
She said it.

305
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,780
She'd kill us one day.

306
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,820
Besides,

307
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,340
they fought
in front of the factory that day.

308
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,460
Because of what?

309
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,500
Hu Lifan introduced her
to the director of the factory.

310
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,180
They had an appointment
but she didn't go.

311
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,820
You mean Zhao from the factory?

312
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,540
He was also a director.

313
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,060
Nan Ya is really pathetic.

314
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,420
What? Is she a fairy?

315
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,340
She likes no one.

316
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,540
She would only fall for Xu Yi,
your son-in-law.

317
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,660
Were you happy with it?

318
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,780
Devil.

319
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,260
♪I can't find his whereabouts♪

320
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,860
♪I only see trees shaken by wind♪

321
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,020
♪I rushed into the forest♪

322
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,380
♪The forest is bushy♪

323
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,740
♪I can't find his whereabouts♪

324
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,820
Trustworthy friendship.

325
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,580
The friendship
that's supposed to be broken

326
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,220
is often tied up

327
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
and fixed by us.

328
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
The friendship
that's not supposed to be broken

329
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,540
is often destroyed by us.

330
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,060
Both situations are tragedies.

331
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,860
But the friendship
that's not supposed to be broken

332
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,980
is so precious.

333
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,340
It is destroyed by ourselves.

334
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,740
This is a fatal blow

335
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,020
to human conscience.

336
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,780
It may be caused by misunderstanding,

337
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,380
history,

338
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,220
or personality.

339
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,860
Nan Ya.

340
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,620
Are you getting better?

341
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,860
Why didn't you come that night?

342
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,460
Were you sick?

343
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,020
Was it bad?

344
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,380
I'm all well now.

345
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,060
I'm just asking.

346
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,260
After all, there's only a meteor shower

347
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,700
every two to three years.

348
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,660
That was such a shame.

349
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,620
It was nothing.

350
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,820
They're just some meteor stars.

351
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,980
They're gone in a blink.

352
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,460
Indeed.

353
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,100
It rained that night.

354
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
We didn't see many meteor stars.

355
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,900
Had you waited for me for long?

356
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,980
I didn't really wait.

357
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,410
We were stuck in the pavilion
due to the rain.

358
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,140
When the New Culture Movement

359
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,300
was in full swing,

360
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,980
the salvoes

361
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,220
of the October Revolution

362
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,260
brought Marxism-Leninism to China.

363
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,940
In 1918, Li Dazhao published

364
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,700
a comparative view
of French and Russian revolutions,

365
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,580
and The Triumph
of Bolshevism and other articles.

366
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,580
He pointed out

367
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,340
that the Russian Revolution in 1917

368
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,620
was based on socialism.

369
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,100
Nan Ya.

370
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
Nan Ya, wait for me.

371
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:46,940
Nan Ya.

372
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,340
Nan Ya.

373
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,420
Are you going to join
the quiz contest next month?

374
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,460
No.

375
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,780
You're good at math.

376
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,620
You can surely get a good result.

377
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,740
From now on,

378
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,140
don't get involved in my affair.

379
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,660
Did you see that?

380
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,540
Hu Xiu came
to have Nan Ya drop out of school.

381
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,500
I saw that.

382
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,700
She just came out
of the principal's office just now.

383
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,260
Her stepmother won't
pay her university fees.

384
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,060
If her dad had died a few months later,

385
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,700
she would have gone to university.

386
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,300
I wish to have her academic results.

387
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,140
What a waste of talent.

388
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,660
Let's discuss
about our university applications.

389
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,180
I'm working in a factory now.

390
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,780
Look.

391
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,980
This is my uniform.

392
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,980
How is it there?

393
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,780
What do you think?

394
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,500
I can finally
support myself financially.

395
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,580
Lin Fanglu.

396
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,980
Stop running.

397
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,540
How many rounds have you run?

398
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,660
Have you thought it through?

399
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,900
I have!

400
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,220
I'm going back.

401
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,580
Lin Fanglu.

402
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,900
Don't act on impulse.

403
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,060
I'm not acting on impulse.

404
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,660
I must return there.

405
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,980
I can't watch her

406
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,780
work in such a tiny factory

407
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,580
forever.

408
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,660
Who do you think you are?

409
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,660
Who are you to her?

410
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,220
Listen up.

411
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,580
No one can change

412
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,780
the fate of the others in this world.

413
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,860
I could have helped her.

414
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,420
I was a coward.

415
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,100
I didn't even confess my feelings
in the end.

416
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,180
I saw her being forced
to drop out of school.

417
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,500
I could have taken her

418
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,860
out of Qingshui Town.

419
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,060
Yes.

420
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,100
I will take her out of Qingshui Town.

421
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,780
Where are you going?

422
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,540
I'm going to the train station.

423
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,940
Lin Fanglu, calm down.

424
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,020
How should I be calm?

425
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,540
Why should I be calm?

426
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,140
Lin Fanglu!

427
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,820
Stop being emotional!

428
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,620
Lin Fanglu, listen to me.

429
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,380
What are you going to say?

430
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,060
You're just a university student.

431
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,980
What do you have?

432
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,180
Do you have money?

433
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,260
Do you have any connections to help her?

434
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,700
Do you have a family
that allows you to do whatever you want?

435
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,060
You have nothing.

436
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,460
Don't act hero.

437
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,580
Can you support her?

438
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,540
Can you get her a job?

439
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,540
She has no academic record

440
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,660
nor registered permanent residence.

441
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,460
She can only get a temporary job
when she's here.

442
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,540
Would that be better

443
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,980
than working in the factory?

444
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,140
Since she quit school

445
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
and you enrolled in the university,

446
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,620
Your paths in life

447
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,700
are no longer the same.

448
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,860
Her family

449
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,020
is nothing but a mess.

450
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,060
With such a relationship,

451
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,220
your future

452
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,820
will be incredibly tough.

453
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,260
Don't even talk about dreams.

454
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,140
Solving her problems alone

455
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
would hold you back.

456
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,340
Should I

457
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,220
just let her be

458
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,860
in this quagmire alone

459
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,820
without doing anything

460
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,980
or showing any concern?

461
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,700
It's beyond your control.

462
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,740
The pain of a disappointed love
is so transient.

463
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,180
But life choices

464
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,420
made with just a thought

465
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,900
can have great consequences.

466
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,060
If you make a wrong choice,

467
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,500
it may take you years to get over it.

468
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,140
Why don't you choose

469
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,860
an easier path?

470
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,980
Think about it.

471
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Is anybody here?

472
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,700
[Sanhe Local Food Restaurant]

473
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,780
Is there anyone?

474
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,900
Is there anyone?

475
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,820
Who are you?

476
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,780
What do you want?

477
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,300
I'm from the police station.

478
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,700
I came to see you

479
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,660
to inquire about something.

480
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,500
I... I'll be down there.

481
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,100
It's been almost a month now.

482
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,220
We're closed for business.

483
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
No one came.

484
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,300
Boss refused to pay.

485
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,140
No one works here.

486
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,700
How long had this opened?

487
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,860
Many years.

488
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,060
I was in charge of the restaurant.

489
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,860
The business wasn't good.

490
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,860
Did it make money?

491
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,460
Of course not.

492
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,580
There were losses every year.

493
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,300
I talked to my boss.

494
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,500
The location here

495
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,860
is so bad.

496
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,220
Might as well open a small store.

497
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,500
No one would come and eat here.

498
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,300
But my boss

499
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,820
was a rich guy. He didn't care.

500
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,660
He bought this place

501
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,140
and forgot about it.

502
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,940
Have a look at this.

503
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,620
Is this your boss?

504
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,380
No.

505
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,380
The last name of my boss is Xu.

506
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
He's called Xu Jian.

507
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,140
- Xu Jian?
- Yes.

508
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,500
I remember this person.

509
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,420
He was here a few times.

510
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,260
When these two came to eat,

511
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,700
were there any other customers
in the restaurant?

512
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,420
No.

513
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,460
What did they talk about?

514
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,460
They sent us out
after we served the food.

515
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,620
How long did they talk?

516
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,020
Over an hour.

517
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,260
And then?

518
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
They then left by car.

519
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,020
With the same car?

520
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,300
No, two separate cars.

521
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,620
One after another.

522
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,820
Has your boss contacted you recently?

523
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,100
Yes.

524
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,340
He told me

525
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,980
to close down the shop and leave.

526
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,780
He said

527
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,300
he had no more money.

528
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
Well, why are you still here?

529
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,580
I dismissed the workers.

530
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,420
And I'm still looking
for something to do.

531
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,180
I still haven't figured out where to go.

532
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,940
Have you been around

533
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,740
since the restaurant opened?

534
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,060
I oversaw the renovation.

535
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,020
This place was a car repair shop.

536
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,340
The car repair shop

537
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,420
was making some money.

538
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Those who passed by

539
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,700
drove long distances.

540
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,940
There were chances

541
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,820
of a flat tire

542
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,980
or oil leakage.

543
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,860
But he insisted on turning it
into a restaurant.

544
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,740
It would be good enough

545
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,100
if there were two tables of customers

546
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,260
each day.

547
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,540
How many years has it been
since this shop was bought?

548
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,620
Five years, I guess.

549
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,380
Five years?

550
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,540
Yes, five years.

551
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,540
I bought the restaurant that year.

552
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
He wanted it urgently.

553
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,020
And he wanted to buy it immediately

554
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,820
to have a place to discuss things.

555
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,940
But he didn't show up at all.

556
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,820
I ever tried to persuade him.

557
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,900
I said it's okay to buy the shop.

558
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,460
But a repair shop

559
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,780
would make more money there.

560
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,340
And the workers are readily available.

561
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,460
He said his aim wasn't to make money.

562
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,220
Do you remember

563
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,060
the mechanics who worked here?

564
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,980
I don't.

565
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,060
They were not from here.

566
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,100
They left long ago.

567
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,420
Okay, got it.

568
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,380
Thank you.

569
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,980
Okay.

570
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,940
Goodbye.

571
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,700
Officer Lin, I got it.

572
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,420
Chen.

573
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,900
I found one mechanic

574
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,140
who didn't leave.

575
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,380
His name is Wu Shangui.

576
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,300
He married a woman
in the neighboring Rongshui Town.

577
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,260
So he stayed
and opened a Mahjong parlor.

578
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,220
Look.

579
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,100
This is his information. And...

580
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,420
Here's the address.

581
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,180
Win.

582
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,260
Who's Wu Shangui?

583
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,020
Shangui.

584
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,540
Shangui.

585
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,020
Someone is here for you.

586
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Are you Shangui?

587
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,300
I'm here to inquire about something.

588
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,740
Yes, that's him.

589
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,780
He was here.

590
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,540
It's been so many years,

591
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,180
yet you still remember so well.

592
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,820
This man left a deep impression on me.

593
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,220
He was quite eccentric.

594
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
The road uphill
near our car repair shop

595
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,420
was under construction.

596
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,740
No car was allowed.

597
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,780
He might have driven past there

598
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,860
so

599
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,700
he had a flat tire.

600
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,140
We were afraid
that we couldn't fix it at night.

601
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,300
So we told him to open the trunk

602
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,780
to see if there's a spare tire
that we can use.

603
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,420
He said there was no spare tire.

604
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,100
He insisted on not opening the trunk.

605
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,700
By the way,

606
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,860
there was a woman in the car.

607
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,020
She refused to get out of the car.

608
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,260
Was that the woman?

609
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,740
I... I'm not sure.

610
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,660
The woman didn't get out of the car.

611
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,780
After working for hours,

612
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,580
the car wasn't repaired.

613
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,500
Eventually, the man told us

614
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,620
to just get the car moving.

615
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,700
We filled the tire

616
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,860
and he left.

617
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,940
I thought he could
perhaps make it to the town.

618
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,100
Do you remember when exactly it was?

619
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,060
It was perhaps the night

620
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,060
three days before our shop closed down.

621
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,380
They drove downhill that night.

622
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,780
Let's have a look ahead there.

623
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,380
What's ahead?

624
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,540
A hillside road.

625
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
Ever since there's a highway,

626
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,300
not many drive this way.

627
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,380
If that woman was Nan Ya,

628
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,140
it's very likely

629
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,260
that she and Xu Yi

630
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,780
killed Hu Lifan together

631
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,500
and dumped the body in the outskirts.

632
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,420
So they needed

633
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,900
a ticket clerk

634
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,020
to provide an alibi.

635
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,820
Chen Ling

636
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,940
helped them indirectly.

637
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,300
Where exactly is it?

638
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,900
Are you sure you want to keep searching?

639
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,820
Keep searching.

640
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,580
Keep on searching.

641
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,020
If I were Xu Yi,

642
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,660
this would be the best place
to dump the body.

643
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,460
This is just your guess.

644
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,380
We still don't know
if he was the one who killed him.

645
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,540
Do you believe in instinct?

646
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,020
I told you,

647
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,820
instinct

648
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,140
is not reliable.

649
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,180
But my first instinct tells me

650
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
the body is right here.

651
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,460
It's such a big lake.

652
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,260
If we are to conduct a search here,

653
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,700
it'll be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

654
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,100
How much manpower
and resources do we need for it?

655
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,420
Think it through.

656
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,380
What if you can't find anything?

657
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,820
Let's do it.
