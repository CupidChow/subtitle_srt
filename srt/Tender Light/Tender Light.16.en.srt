[Episode 16]

2
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:49,090
[Tender Light]

3
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,580
Why...

4
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,740
Did you lie to him today?

5
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,860
Because...

6
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,340
Because I like you.

7
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,820
I've liked you

8
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,540
since the moment I saw you.

9
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,060
Actually, on Millennium Night,

10
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,060
I was going to tell you...

11
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,460
That I like you.

12
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,100
My feelings for you

13
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,860
aren't a spur-of-the-moment thing.

14
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,300
And it's not just I flipped.

15
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,940
It's something much deeper.

16
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,620
Hence, I'm willing to believe
everything you've said.

17
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,580
Everything.

18
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,700
If you've made up your mind
to protect someone,

19
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,620
I, Zhang Qingli,

20
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,140
will always be on your side.

21
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,460
Wait for a bit.

22
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,500
Let's get some food.

23
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,000
[The day after the train station
incident happened,

24
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,660
Autumn, 1999]

25
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,020
Come on.

26
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,500
I'll go with you.

27
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:26,940
What do you guys want?

28
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,540
I want the blue-colored plum.

29
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:28,900
Okay.

30
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,180
Xu Yi beat her so badly
in front of everyone

31
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
yesterday.

32
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,460
And still, she shows herself
in public shamelessly.

33
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,940
No one could've expected her
to elope with Xu Jian.

34
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,380
No wonder Xu Yi wanted
to beat her to death.

35
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,420
She deserved it.

36
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,540
She's really shameless.

37
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,660
What did you say?

38
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,420
I...

39
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,300
Who is shameless?

40
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,620
You...

41
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,260
Nan Ya.

42
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,340
Qingli, can I ask you for a favor?

43
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,700
What is it?

44
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,660
If it's okay, could you help me
take a few photos?

45
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,500
Okay.

46
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,660
Thank you.

47
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,540
Qingli.

48
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,740
Are you shocked?

49
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,340
I... I need evidence in order to file
a complaint with the Women's Federation.

50
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,420
Nan Ya.

51
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,100
If you're going to file a complaint,

52
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,100
I can go with you.

53
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,060
I'll testify for you.

54
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,260
Thank you.

55
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,940
Qingli.

56
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,500
What's the matter, Qingli?

57
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,780
Don't scare me. What's wrong?

58
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,660
Xu Yi is a devil.

59
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,540
Nan Ya's body is covered in wounds,

60
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
with fresh ones covering old ones.

61
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,340
You saw it all?

62
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,460
She asked me to help her
photograph them for evidence.

63
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,940
Luckily, my sister
didn't marry that piece of trash.

64
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,260
A guy like Xu Yi should just die.

65
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,740
Zhou Luo.

66
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,300
Don't do anything rash, Zhou Luo.

67
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,460
We're just students.

68
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,340
What can we do to someone like Xu Yi?

69
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,980
She... She can go
to the Women's Federation.

70
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,380
She can divorce him.

71
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,220
Even if she's having an affair,

72
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,700
he cannot beat her up so badly.

73
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,180
She wasn't going to elope that day.

74
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,340
Zhou Luo.

75
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,620
Let's go.

76
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,300
So Nan Ya was planning

77
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,740
to run away quietly with Wanwan.

78
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,540
If Xu Jian was eloping with her,

79
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,740
why didn't he have any luggage with him?

80
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,260
Why didn't Xu Yi beat him up?

81
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,420
Also, there were so many people there.

82
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,860
How did Xu Jian

83
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,340
manage to slip away unnoticed?

84
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,340
Xu Yi is so evil.

85
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,740
He's despicable.

86
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,420
So, why is Xu Yi

87
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,140
spoiling his own reputation?

88
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,540
He wants to teach Nan Ya a lesson.

89
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,140
And in front of the whole town,

90
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,500
he labeled Nan Ya as a cheating wife
who tried to elope.

91
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,340
Then it'd be harder for her
to get a divorce.

92
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,780
What's so hard?

93
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,140
We're not living in the old society.

94
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,580
Seek help from the Women's Federation,
or the court.

95
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm sure there's a way
to take Xu Yi down.

96
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,020
What are you shouting for?

97
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,540
Nan Ya's name is now smeared.

98
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,860
Even if her complaint were successful,

99
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,620
they could still threaten her
with Wanwan.

100
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,820
That's right.

101
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,460
Right now, Nan Ya's biggest weakness
is Wanwan.

102
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
My mom said it before.

103
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,060
If she can't get a divorce,

104
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,260
it must be out of fear
of losing her child.

105
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,580
That's why Nan Ya tried
to run away secretly.

106
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,820
There's no better choice.

107
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
How did you know?

108
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,060
Wanwan told me.

109
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,460
I only found out the day before.

110
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,900
How about

111
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,820
we help Nan Ya to run away?

112
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,500
It's going to be much harder
for her to run away now.

113
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,980
I heard Xu Yi knows someone
who's working at the train station.

114
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,860
They'd find out immediately

115
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,980
if she tried to run away.

116
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,020
She can take the bus.

117
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,700
It's the same. You need to take the bus
at the train station too.

118
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,740
Actually, running away

119
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,220
isn't the best option for Nan Ya.

120
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,420
She has a home but she can't go back.

121
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,020
She can only hide.

122
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,300
Moreover, Wanwan is sick.

123
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,300
There's no cure.

124
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,020
Nan Ya is too pitiful.

125
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,100
She can't get a divorce.

126
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,620
She can't run away either.

127
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,300
What are we going to do?

128
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,020
"What are we going to do?",

129
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,900
stop saying this.

130
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,980
I just watched a foreign movie
the other day.

131
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,140
It's about a man

132
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,540
who kills his wife's lover.

133
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,660
He then makes it look like an accident.

134
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,780
That's what happens in the movie.
You guys want to watch it?

135
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,860
Let's watch it now.

136
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,340
The bridge collapsed!

137
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,140
My husband is still
at the construction site!

138
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
The bridge collapsed!

139
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,140
My husband is still
at the construction site!

140
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,220
The bridge collapsed!

141
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,580
What's happened?

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,300
Guixiang, big news!

143
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,780
The bridge by the river has collapsed.

144
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,980
I need to go home

145
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,060
and ask my husband to go take a look.

146
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,300
The bridge collapsed!

147
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,820
Quickly!

148
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,300
Hurry up.

149
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,860
Slowly. Come on.

150
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,900
Make way, make way.

151
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,020
Buddy.

152
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,940
Watch out. Careful!

153
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,580
People will die!

154
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,020
Quickly, dig!

155
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,220
Mr. Xu, please help me.

156
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,060
Mr. Xu, please save me!

157
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,660
You rogue!

158
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,500
Take a look yourself.

159
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,660
Even with substandard materials,

160
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,300
it's impossible
that the whole bridge would collapse.

161
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,700
It caused people to die, you hear me?

162
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,660
People died!

163
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,580
How could it be so fragile?

164
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,700
Xu Jian must have done something shoddy.

165
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,620
Neither of you are innocent!

166
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,540
Someone died.

167
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Someone will die for this.

168
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,300
Now you've realized someone's dead, huh?

169
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,540
Now you're scared
because someone's dead, huh?

170
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,740
You only know to cry and whine.

171
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,220
Crying won't help the situation!
You better go

172
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,060
and get Xu Jian here!

173
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,580
What do we do now?

174
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,460
The authorities are surely
going to investigate it.

175
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Mr. Xu.

176
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,300
Mr. Xu, please save me!

177
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,540
Now you're scared, huh?

178
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,820
Don't grab me!

179
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,420
Stay away!

180
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Listen up.

181
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,620
You two useless goons.

182
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
You couldn't even handle
such simple matters.

183
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,420
You were born to be poor.

184
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,380
Loser!

185
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Mr. Xu.

186
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,020
Mr. Xu, help me!

187
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,580
Mr. Xu!

188
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,340
Mr. Xu, please help me!

189
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,380
Mr. Xu...

190
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,700
Xu Yi is in big trouble this time.

191
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,580
Nan Ya is filing complaints against him.

192
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,260
He might end up in jail.

193
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,780
I also heard

194
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,540
that Xu Yi treated the county leaders
to a meal.

195
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,060
Meanwhile, Nan Ya just stood there

196
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,300
like a crazy woman.

197
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,700
It must be because

198
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,420
Xu Yi beat her up badly before.

199
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,140
That's because Nan Ya was messing around
with another man.

200
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,020
You're right.

201
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah.

202
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,540
That Liu Changshui.

203
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,180
Xu Yi reported Liu Changshui
to the authorities.

204
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,500
Did you hear about that?

205
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,380
I heard it from my husband.

206
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,260
Liu Changshui is immoral.

207
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
You know what?

208
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
He procured substandard materials.

209
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,500
And then he absconded
with Xu Yi's company funds.

210
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,700
Xu Yi said he's trying to raise money.

211
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Did you guys pitch in?

212
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,300
Have you guys watched this?
How about we watch it today?

213
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,780
Did you hear the news?

214
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,700
Liu Xun's dad ran away.

215
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,620
I heard them saying

216
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,140
that Xu Yi reported him.

217
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,540
He supposedly procured
substandard materials.

218
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,860
What are you doing here?

219
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,860
And what are you doing here?

220
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,100
You've been acting sneaky these days.

221
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,140
You think I didn't notice?

222
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,940
The bridge collapsed
and lots of money was spent on it.

223
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,980
There must be something wrong
with Xu Yi, and I'm here to find proof.

224
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,980
Why didn't you ask me to come with you?

225
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,460
You know I want to be a police officer.

226
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,660
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

227
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,340
They're all on high alert right now.

228
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,420
You'd be in danger if they found you,

229
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,940
okay?

230
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,500
There's danger
and yet you're doing it alone.

231
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,620
Am I not your friend?

232
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,820
I'm asking you, am I your friend?

233
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,740
Be careful.

234
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,220
All right.

235
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,340
Let's go.

236
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
We'll check over there.

237
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:45,820
Okay.

238
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,060
Hang on.

239
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,940
Three, two, one. Run!

240
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,620
Go!

241
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,940
Let's go over there.

242
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,220
Be careful.

243
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,380
Slowly.

244
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,380
What are we looking for?

245
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,980
The bridge must have collapsed

246
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,340
due to the construction process
or the substandard materials.

247
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm taking samples.

248
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,060
Hurry, go! Hide over here.

249
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,420
Get over here.

250
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,420
Listen up.

251
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,980
Move

252
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,100
all of these things

253
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,420
out of here tonight.

254
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,420
The place where workers died
has been cordoned off.

255
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,140
They'll surely look into this area too.

256
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,420
So be alert.

257
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,260
We'll start clearing after two AM.
Got it?

258
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,780
Yes, sir.

259
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,580
Be careful.

260
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,980
No one is allowed in here.

261
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,740
Yes, got it.

262
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,500
The investigative team
will be here tomorrow.

263
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,940
If anything goes wrong,
it will cost you.

264
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,740
Yes, sir. Rest assured, Mr. Xu.

265
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,220
As expected,

266
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,260
Xu Jian is putting on an act with Xu Yi.

267
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,420
We better get out of here.

268
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,900
Come on.

269
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,540
Go.

270
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
This way...

271
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,300
Here...

272
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,180
Who's there?

273
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:32,980
It's me.

274
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,380
I'm here.

275
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,700
Don't go over there.

276
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,420
Why can't I go there?

277
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,740
My... My friend has loose bowels.

278
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,980
She couldn't find a toilet.

279
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,460
She's a girl. Don't go peeping at her.

280
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,660
What are you two girls
doing here so late at night?

281
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,620
I'm done...

282
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,740
So sorry. We're leaving right away.

283
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,380
Quickly go. Leave right now.

284
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Got it. Sorry.

285
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,780
Let's go.

286
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:09,980
Hurry up.

287
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,180
Go.

288
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,620
Xu Yi is surely hiding something.

289
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,940
He's just a jerk.

290
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,540
On the surface,
he fell out with Xu Jian.

291
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,380
But actually, they're doing
dirty things together privately.

292
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:30,980
Listen.

293
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
Thank god we went earlier.

294
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,180
Or else anything incriminating
would've been removed.

295
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,220
So Xu Yi is just putting on an act

296
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,300
in front of the townspeople.

297
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,220
On the surface, he claims to be
the aggrieved husband.

298
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,740
But it's actually not that simple.

299
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,980
Indeed.

300
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,020
Not only did he slander Nan Ya,

301
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,220
but he was also threatening her
with Wanwan to not get a divorce.

302
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,140
On the surface,

303
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,700
he's cut any connections with Xu Jian.

304
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,980
But in fact, they were secretly
doing business together.

305
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,500
Xu Yi is truly evil.

306
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,380
Maybe we should call the police.

307
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,220
No, not yet.

308
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,020
Xu Yi definitely

309
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,740
had tricks up his sleeve
regarding the bridge incident.

310
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,860
We'll secretly follow him.

311
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,140
Maybe

312
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
we could find some useful evidence

313
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,700
that could send him straight to jail.

314
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,620
I agree.

315
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,300
I also can take this chance
to take my sister's revenge.

316
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,700
But the bridge collapse incident
is a serious matter.

317
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,900
Isn't he supposed to be investigated?

318
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,980
That's different.

319
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,780
How so?

320
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,220
They only know what happened
on the surface

321
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,460
but not the dirty things underneath.

322
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,460
They investigate openly

323
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,220
while we investigate secretly.

324
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,420
Anyone here have a camera?

325
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,700
A good one.

326
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,700
I do.

327
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,380
I have an SLR.

328
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,900
It's a little glitchy.

329
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,660
But it's still usable.

330
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,740
Zhou Luo.

331
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,700
Isn't that Xu Yi's car?

332
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,220
Let's find a place to hide.

333
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,460
Let's go.

334
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,780
Is he here?

335
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,060
He's coming.

336
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,220
Go.

337
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,460
Quickly.

338
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,620
Follow him.

339
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Chen Jun!

340
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,220
Chen Jun, wait up!

341
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,020
Ride faster!

342
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,940
I wish there was a ham in the bun.

343
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,380
There's no time.

344
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,780
He's back.

345
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,020
[Sanhe Local Food Restaurant]

346
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,260
You stay and watch them.

347
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,460
I'm going to follow him.

348
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,940
Where is he?

349
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,660
He's in there.

350
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,460
Didn't he abscond with the money?

351
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,940
Why is he secretly meeting with Xu Yi?

352
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,020
Liu Changshui didn't run away.

353
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,540
It was just fake news put on by Xu Yi.

354
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,660
Anyway, do you know Liu Changshui well?

355
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,260
Well, I know he's Liu Xun's dad.

356
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,340
What does he do?

357
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,700
I think he works at a factory.

358
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,060
We will know more about him.

359
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,540
Just ask Qingli to go
to her dad's office

360
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,820
and look up the information secretly.

361
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,700
Let's wait for a bit.

362
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,900
He's coming.

363
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
He's out.

364
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,860
Sure thing, Mr. Zhang.

365
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,780
I'll be there in a jiffy.

366
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,780
It's no trouble.

367
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,700
Mr. Xu.

368
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,940
We already agreed.

369
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,060
How much money have you received?
Why should I give you more?

370
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,900
Come on, let's go.

371
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,660

we could catch up with him.

during the countdown of the millennium.

I went to look for Zhou Luo.

404
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,220
He received admission to Jinghua
with a reduced score.

We were happy for him.

That bastard, Liu Xun.

412

The light in the room upstairs
was off.

418
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,580
So I sat on the doorstep to wait.

419

I didn't know he had a stomachache.

I didn't check the time then.

Because...

my sister would've hit me badly.

The sole reason why Zhou Luo
fought with Xu Yi

442
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,140
was because Xu Yi was being rough
and abusive.

If it was me,
I couldn't have stood it either.

Who wants to get involved
with that couple's business anyway?

It's stressful enough
