[Episode 17]

2
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,110
Did you kill him?

3
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,360
Just tell me the truth.

4
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,960
I won't betray my buddy.

5
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,550
Yes.

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
I didn't see it.

7
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,920
I didn't see it.

8
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,990
I saw nothing.

9
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,960
Run away.

10
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
Just run away.

11
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
How?

12
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,760
Chen Jun.

13
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,830
You know what?

14
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,320
When you pierce a knife into the heart
and pull it out,

15
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,480
the blood will splash up
to three to five meters high.

16
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,390
So much blood.

17
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,830
The killer could never erase

18
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,240
his traces.

19
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,710
Because it's impossible
for him not to be splattered with blood.

20
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,800
Even if he washes it off,

21
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,480
there are special devices
that can detect it.

22
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,640
Chen Jun.

23
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,040
Do you think

24
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,040
the police will be able to find out?

25
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,590
Will they?

26
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,360
Can they?

27
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,590
Can they?

28
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,110
It's only a matter of time.

29
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,390
Go back and have a rest.

30
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,470
Chen Jun.

31
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,320
Go home now.

32
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,910
Chen Jun.

33
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,520
Screw you!

34
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,590
My God!

35
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,900
[Tender Light]

36
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,320
Have you seen this photo before?

37
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,910
Yes.

38
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,200
Where?

39
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,270
Who took it?

40
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,230
I did.

41
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,710
You?

42
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,790
Yes.

43
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,470
Did you follow Xu Yi before?

44
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
I wanted to find the proof
of his crimes.

45
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,590
To use it as leverage
to get a divorce and child custody.

46
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,520
Then how did Xu Jian

47
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,760
get this photo?

48
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,230
Xu Jian?

49
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Yes.

50
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,150
I don't know.

51
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Had Xu Yi ever seen this photo?

52
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,390
No.

53
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,230
He probably found it himself.

54
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,590
When you were following Xu Yi,

55
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,200
did you notice anything off with him?

56
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,960
There was definitely something

57
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,520
between him and Liu Changshui.

58
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
But I only managed to take some photos.

59
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,270
I didn't find
any concrete evidence.

60
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,470
When did you take this photo?

61
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,150
I don't remember.

62
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,390
It was probably
after Xu Yi reported Liu Changshui.

63
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,000
Are there any other photos?

64
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:34,960
Yes.

65
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,030
They're similar to this one.

66
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,470
Photos of their meetings,

67
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
them arguing

68
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
and them on the streets.

69
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,030
That's all.

70
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,030
The night Xu Yi was killed,

71
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,910
did you show him this photo?

72
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,270
No.

73
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,320
Morning.

74
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Officer Lin.

75
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,710
I didn't take that photo.

76
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,200
Who did it, then?

77
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,200
I stole it

78
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,990
from Xu Yi's place.

79
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,300
Morning.

80
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,660
You're early.

81
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,780
Take a look.

82
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,780
Do you really think it was Nan Ya
who took these photos?

83
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Who else could it be?

84
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,700
If she had taken these photos,

85
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,300
when Liu Changshui went missing

86
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,740
after meeting Xu Yi at that restaurant,

87
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,620
she could've guessed then

88
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,980
that Liu Changshui had likely
been killed by Xu Yi.

89
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,860
She probably did guess it

90
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,380
and used it to threaten him.

91
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,860
But she denied that she knew about this.

92
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,660
Well, murder isn't like
buying ingredients or cooking meals.

93
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,940
It was said Liu Changshui ran away,

94
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,980
so no one would
entertain the other notion.

95
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,540
To take such photos,

96
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,660
the person must have
staked out for a long time.

97
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,740
Whereas Nan Ya

98
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,500
had a store to run
and a kid to look after,

99
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,420
there was no time to accomplish

100
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,900
such laborious and time-consuming work.

101
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,220
Besides,

102
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,980
wouldn't it be obvious

103
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,380
for her to follow him?

104
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,020
Be quiet.

105
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,340
Okay.

106
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,140
Also,

107
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,780
don't forget.

108
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,500
Where was this photo found?

109
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,220
It was in Xu Yi's house.

110
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,660
What it shows

111
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,860
is absolutely detrimental

112
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,340
for Xu Yi.

113
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,540
But what was Xu Yi doing?

114
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,820
He was leisurely having a dinner
with Chen Ling

115
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,220
and agreed to get a divorce
as Chen Ling persuaded.

116
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,980
Then he waited until the fireworks
on Millennium Night

117
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,860
before he lost his mind

118
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,780
and decided to kill Nan Ya.

119
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,500
That just doesn't make any sense.

120
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,300
So, what's your conclusion?

121
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,740
The isn't that simple.

122
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,940
I'm afraid it's more complicated
than murder.

123
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,940
And the bottle?

124
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,820
Is there hot water?

125
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,300
You are here early.

126
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,900
Drink some.

127
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,380
I just filled the hot water.

128
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,020
Go!

129
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
Zhou Luo!

130
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,620
Here.

131
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,220
Okay.

132
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,060
Drink slowly.

133
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Okay, enough.

134
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,860
You can do it!

135
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,620
Qingli!

136
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,860
Who are you waiting for here?

137
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,620
Don't make trouble.

138
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
I'll wait here for a while with you.

139
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,820
No, don't. Don't be a third wheel.

140
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,500
Get up.

141
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,420
You don't usually care
about me that much.

142
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,860
Go.

143
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,020
Hurry up.

144
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,620
So annoying.

145
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,700
We'll wait for you ahead.

146
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,540
Bye-bye. Take care.

147
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,260
We're off!

148
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
Bye-bye.

149
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,340
We're leaving, Mr. Wang.

150
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,140
Bye, sir.

151
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,740
Bye.

152
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,980
Are you seated?

153
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,300
Yes.

154
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,620
Isn't that Zhou Luo?

155
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,300
Yes.

156
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,660
Who's the girl?

157
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,340
She's Zhang Huashan's daughter.

158
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,340
Huashan's daughter?

159
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,380
From the school next door.

160
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,020
Zhou Luo's something.

161
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,540
She's dating an expired top scorer.

162
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,860
A repeat student
with an expelled student.

163
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Pretty good match, I'd say.

164
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,500
What's the secret to date
both young and old?

165
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,500
Yeah, teach us how you made it.

166
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,700
What's the difference
between those in the 20s

167
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
and those in the 40s?

168
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,700
How different are they?

169
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,100
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,580
Actually,

171
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,180
I kind of wish

172
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,700
every day would be like today.

173
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,140
You know what?

174
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,940
I didn't know how to get closer

175
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,540
to you before.

176
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,820
I always thought

177
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,020
that you were good at your studies.

178
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,060
You're smart.

179
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,340
And you're kind of aloof.

180
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,500
I didn't know how
to start a conversation

181
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,100
or chat with you.

182
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,780
As for the books you read

183
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,220
and the music you listen to,

184
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
they all seem different
from what we like.

185
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,260
I haven't even heard most of them.

186
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,620
I always thought

187
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,220
maybe we could never

188
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,340
become that kind of friends.

189
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,340
But now,

190
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,700
I feel like we're much closer.

191
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,260
Now,

192
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,180
I study hard every day.

193
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,740
My results have improved a lot too.

194
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,660
It's all because of you.

195
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,100
I'm trying quite hard.

196
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,700
Because I want to get
into a university in Beijing too.

197
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,060
I want to be in the same city as you.

198
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,940
But I'm not sure
if I can do a good job on the exam.

199
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,180
You will.

200
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,660
You'll surely do well.

201
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,500
Before, I was always impatient

202
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,540
about a lot of things.

203
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,980
But now,

204
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,500
I don't feel pressured at all.

205
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,420
Because we're still young.

206
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,780
There's plenty of time.

207
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,500
I believe

208
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,300
that nothing is impossible.

[Guanghua Photo Studio]

210
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,500
Sir.

211
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,260
Hello, how can I help you?

212
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,060
I'm a police officer.

213
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,780
Officer.

214
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,940
Could you check

215
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,500
if this photo was developed by you?

216
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,940
I'm really sorry.

217
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,700
You see, I have to develop

218
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,500
a whole bunch of photos in a day.

219
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,100
It's hard for me to tell.

220
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,020
Please take a closer look.

221
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,660
This photo

222
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,980
is definitely not from here.

223
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,140
You can check the photo paper we use.

224
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,260
It's different, right?

225
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Then could you tell
what kind of camera

226
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,500
was used to take this photo?

227
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,580
It was probably

228
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,660
a good SLR.

229
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,660
Are there any other
photo studios like this

230
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,700
in the area?

231
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,860
Mine is the only one here.

232
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,540
You'll have to go to the city

233
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,860
if you want to find another one.

234
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,340
Thanks.

235
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,220
Don't mention it.

236
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,300
Take care.

237
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,100
Xu Yi.

238
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,180
Where is my dad?

239
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,180
I already told you many times.

240
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,660
Stop following me.

241
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,540
Your dad did something bad and ran away.

242
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,940
He even stole money from my company.

243
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,900
I'm also looking for him.

244
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,860
Nonsense!

245
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,620
You're the crook.

246
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,660
You're paying my dad to take the blame.

247
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,700
When my dad disagreed,

248
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,780
you set him up!

249
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,620
Listen up, kid. I'm in a bad mood today.

250
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,340
This matter has nothing to do with you.

251
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,780
You better stay far away from me!

252
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,060
Get out of the car!

253
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,740
Xu Yi!

254
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,020
Tell me where my dad is.

255
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,980
Listen!

256
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,700
I know

257
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,140
about your dirty deals!

258
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
You followed me?

259
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,020
Did you take these?

260
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,620
You little rascal.

261
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,740
Jerk!

262
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,060
You're a loser,

263
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,580
just like your dad!

264
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,500
Two losers

265
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,620
want to set me up?

266
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,060
Troublemaker!

267
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,740
Tell me.

268
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
What else did you photograph?

269
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,980
Hand them over.

270
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,260
If you don't hand them over,

271
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
you're going to die right here!

272
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,140
If you don't tell me,

273
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,780
I'm going to keep following you.

274
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,580
Hand them over!

275
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,700
When did you buy

276
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,620
that sticker on your bike?

277
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,260
It has nothing to do with you.

278
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,340
It has.

279
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,140
When?

280
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,060
Lunatic.

281
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,100
Where did you get the sticker?

282
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,020
My cousin got it for me from Shanghai.

283
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,900
I saw your bike

284
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,180
outside Xu Yi's company.

285
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,180
Did you go there?

286
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,940
No.

287
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,420
I remember what I saw.

288
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,820
Speak up.

289
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,180
I said, speak up!

290
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,820
It's none of your business.

291
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,740
Are you sleepwalking?

292
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,500
Why would I go to his company?

293
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,820
That's why I'm asking you.

294
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,140
Did you lend your bike to someone?

295
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,860
Who was it?

296
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,700
Who was it?

297
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,420
Was it Zhou Luo?

298
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,340
Why would I lend it to him?

299
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,740
This is a bike designed for women.

300
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,820
If you're free,

301
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,020
then study harder.

302
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,180
Stop wasting time
feeling envious of others.

303
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,180
Why would I be envious of him?

304
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,140
He's just a pathetic jerk
who got expelled.

305
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,500
What is there to be jealous of?

306
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,980
He was involved

307
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,860
with a forty-plus-year-old teacher.

308
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,340
Don't be that loud.

309
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,580
He got expelled
because he already had admission.

310
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,140
But you?

311
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,900
You aren't even qualified
to get expelled.

312
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,620
Are you stupid or what?

313
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,140
He's clearly just
taking advantage of you

314
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,300
and yet you defend him?

315
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,300
Can't you see it?

316
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,500
He's just a hypocritical jerk!

317
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,580
What are you, then?

318
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,780
A despicable prick!

319
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,700
I...

320
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,940
Do you guys think

321
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,540
that because we were blackmailing Xu Yi,

322
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,060
Liu Changshui got killed?

323
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,020
Xu Yi must have convinced Liu Changshui
to take the blame

324
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,500
so he could get away with it unscathed.

325
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,060
He reported Liu Changshui
for absconding with the money

326
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,260
but secretly made a deal with him.

327
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,700
There's definitely something fishy.

328
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,780
Maybe we should report it to the police.

329
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,060
Just shut up.

330
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,780
Liu Changshui has been missing
for some days.

331
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,180
Maybe he's really run away.

332
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,420
We can't get him to be convicted

333
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,780
with just these photos.

334
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,500
What do we do, then?

335
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,180
Yeah.

336
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
We could threaten him.

337
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,300
How?

338
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
Yeah, how?

339
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,060
Do you have a blank envelope?

340
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,700
Yes.

341
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,060
You've got everything at your house.

342
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,980
Will this work?

343
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,420
Here.

344
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,020
Yes.

345
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,180
We'll send him this photo.

346
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,140
If he's hiding something,

347
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,380
it'll definitely fluster him.

348
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,540
Then we don't need

349
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,580
to look for evidence ourselves.

350
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,940
You're right.

351
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,580
As expected from a top scorer.

352
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,900
Qingli, you should learn more
from Zhou Luo.

353
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,420
You are the one
who should learn from him.

354
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Gosh.

355
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,380
What should we write on it?

356
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,180
Nothing.

357
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,580
We'll just send him the photo

358
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,060
and see how he reacts.

359
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,660
We'll then send him another photo

360
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,740
every couple of days.

361
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,140
Xu Yi hasn't been
to the company for a few days.

362
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,820
Even when he's here, he's acting sneaky.

363
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,180
Could he have noticed?

364
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,540
Yeah, it must be.

365
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,180
We've sent some photos to his company,

366
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,780
some to his house,

367
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,380
and even left some in his car.

368
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,100
He's probably frightened.

369
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,140
I think it's a little bugged.

370
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,340
Maybe we should stop
following him tomorrow.

371
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
I haven't been home at all
during the break.

372
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,140
My dad has noticed it.

373
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,940
You're right.

374
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
You still need to go to school tomorrow,
so stop following him.

375
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,060
I can do it myself.

376
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,140
You'll keep following him, Zhou Luo?

377
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,740
Aren't you too invested in this matter?

378
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,100
Isn't that Liu Xun?

379
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,260
Liu Xun just ran by.

380
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
What's he doing here?

381
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,980
Chen Jun.

382
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,020
Let's go and check it out.

383
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,260
Be careful.

384
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,540
You too.

385
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,020
Tell me.

386
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,820
What else did you photograph?

387
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,420
Hand them over!

388
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,300
He's going to kill him.

389
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,500
What do we do?

390
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,700
We have to save him.

391
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,180
Barging in won't do any good.

392
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,340
The electric switch.

393
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,940
Go, hurry!

394
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,060
Zhou Luo.

395
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,100
I'll be honest with you today.

396
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,660
I actually kind of envy you.

397
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,260
I might seem like I don't care

398
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,980
and don't want to go to university.

399
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,860
However,

400
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,780
I've been envying you.

401
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,660
You're smart.

402
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,900
Who wouldn't want to be smart?

403
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,020
If I were as smart as you,

404
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,260
I'd definitely leave this place.

405
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,420
Who wouldn't want to be a top student

406
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,500
and go to a prestigious school?

407
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,020
What's the saying again?

408
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,500
A "bright future", right?

409
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,820
But for some people, they might never

410
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,540
cross paths with that prospect.

411
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,980
Never ever.

412
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,340
Why are you looking at me?

413
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,700
Didn't I make myself clear?

414
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,180
Not everyone is

415
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,700
as lucky as you.

416
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,260
Madam Guixiang and Mr. Zhou

417
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
are like us.

418
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,380
We are all normal people.

419
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,500
But you...

420
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,140
Don't waste that good brain of yours.

421
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,140
As for those things we did before,

422
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,900
they have nothing to do with you.

423
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,860
And whatever happened that night,

424
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,540
you don't have to tell me.

425
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,620
To me, it means nothing.

426
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,900
But the moment this mess is over,

427
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,260
I want you to leave.

428
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,660
Leave and fight for your future.

429
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,140
Say goodbye

430
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,020
to all the people and things here!

431
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,580
You hear me?

432
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,020
Why did Xu Yi kill my dad?

433
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,820
When he was still alive,
he had threatened Xu Yi.

434
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,900
This was the last time
your father showed up.

435
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,540
That restaurant is owned by Xu Yi.

436
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,220
It is only two kilometers
from where the body was hidden.

437
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,540
I just want to know.

438
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,660
Who took this photo?

439
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,900
We're not sure just yet.

440
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,940
Sir.

441
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,420
Sir.

442
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,860
[Guanghua Photo Studio]

443
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,620
Could you take a look at this for me?

444
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,740
It looks like a composite.

445
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,780
I can't see clearly without my glasses.

446
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,420
Let me take a look outside.

447
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,540
Quickly, please.

448
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,100
I don't think it's the original.

449
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,100
Look.

450
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,660
Here.

451
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,980
The focus can't be here and there
at the same time.

452
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,460
This is a composite of two photos.

453
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,780
But...

454
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,220
But this photo wasn't developed
at our studio.

455
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,980
So, who tampered with it

456
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,140
and left it in our studio?

457
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,780
You're right.

458
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,100
That's odd.

459
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
This is really baffling.

460
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,180
Sir.

461
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,100
Sir.

462
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,300
What?

463
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,660
Do you remember

464
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,780
who it was that brought here
the stack of bad films?

465
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,820
I don't remember.

466
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,660
They never came back to get them.

467
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,260
The photos.

468
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,060
Where are they?

469
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,380
I threw them away.

470
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,380
No one wanted them.

471
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,220
Why should I keep them?

472
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I need to find my glasses.

473
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,460
I can't do anything without them.

474
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
This is blank.

475
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,180
January.

476
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,060
There's no January.

477
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,580
Zhou Luo.

478
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,940
I'm here to get Zhou Luo's photos.

479
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,300
Sure, just a minute.

480
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Are they ready?

481
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,180
Yes, yes.

482
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,140
They turned out very good.

483
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,820
You know this photo, right?

484
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,980
Get out.

485
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,820
You took this photo, right?

486
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,540
You deliberately left it
at the photo studio

487
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,540
so that I'd take it to the police.

488
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,340
You also photographed my dad and Xu Yi

489
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,380
at the restaurant, didn't you?

490
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,060
I don't want to talk to a crazy mutt.

491
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,380
Then why don't you look at me?

492
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,020
If you hadn't taken these photos,

493
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,300
Xu Yi wouldn't have killed my dad!

494
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,180
If I had taken the photo,

495
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
I'd at least make it clearer.

496
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,460
It was you!

497
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,220
You caused my dad's death!

498
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,180
I think you missed an important point.

499
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,620
Wasn't your dad killed

500
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,020
because the spoils were
unevenly distributed?

501
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,860
Although he is the victim
of this homicide,

502
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,980
it doesn't clear him

503
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,420
of his involvement in the bridge case.

504
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,460
What are you looking at?

505
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,540
I'm going to destroy you!

506
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,620
I'll make sure

507
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,980
you're never allowed into a university!

508
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,140
Zhou Luo.

509
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Zhou Luo.

510
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,100
Why is it always you?

511
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,980
We will now begin the eighth set
of radio calisthenics.

512
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,460
Walk in place. Ready, go.

513
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,820
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

514
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,740
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, stop.

515
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,460
Stretching exercises.

516
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,060
Ready, start.

517
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:50,540
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

518
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:58,020
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

519
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,780
Three, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

520
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,340
Four, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

521
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,660
Chest expansion exercises.

522
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,980
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

523
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,900
What about Zhou Luo?

524
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,780
What do you guys think about him?

525
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,820
He's a top student.

526
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,580
He's totally different

527
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,940
in this cram school.

528
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,100
However, to us,

529
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,340
he's one of our best friends.

530
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,420
Fanglu,

531
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,740
just get straight to the point.

532
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,780
Go to the radio room.

533
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:38,860
It's nothing.

534
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,460
I'm just having
a casual chat with you guys.

535
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,380
Excuse us.

536
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,220
What do you guys

537
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,620
think about Zhou Luo's personality?

538
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020
He's pretty nice.

539
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,900
Is that all?

540
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,340
He's smart,

541
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,540
kind,

542
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,580
and sincere.

543
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,020
And loyal.

544
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,980
Do you guys think

545
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,940
that Zhou Luo is an impulsive person

546
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,700
in his daily life?

547
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
He's a guy.

548
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,420
I think it's normal for a guy
to be impulsive.
