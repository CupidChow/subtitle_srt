00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,020
We promised not to mention
why he was expelled

187
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,580
to the outside world.

188
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,460
We're giving him

189
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,540
a second chance here.

190
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,220
Therefore...

191
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,100
Here, have some tea.

192
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,780
Don't worry.

193
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,900
We'll definitely

194
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,020
keep this a secret.

195
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,540
We won't prevent him
from furthering his studies.

196
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,860
Well, in essence,

197
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,420
Zhou Luo was

198
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,660
an excellent student.

199
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,020
His grades were good.

200
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,700
He didn't have any bad habits either.

201
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,540
However,

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,420
some of the things he did

203
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,460
impacted the school

204
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,820
very negatively.

205
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,660
Therefore, we had no choice

206
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,740
but to deal with him in this manner.

207
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,300
Is it related to her?

208
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
How did you know?

209
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,620
Her name is Yang Mei.

210
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,060
She teaches theoretical mechanics
in our department.

211
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,180
However,

212
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,260
she has a cold personality.

213
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,860
She's still single
even though she's almost 40.

214
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,900
She's not close

215
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,220
to her colleagues.

216
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,980
And she doesn't interact much

217
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,220
with her students.

218
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,460
However, she likes
and takes good care of Zhou Luo.

219
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,940
She often asked Zhou Luo

220
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,580
to translate the research materials.

221
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,860
She even designated Zhou Luo
to participate

222
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,780
in competitions and workshops
outside of school.

223
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,860
Gradually,

224
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,540
they were getting

225
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,460
too close to each other.

226
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,100
People started to gossip about them.

227
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,500
Some people even said

228
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,620
that the two of them
were having an affair.

229
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,420
Did they have an affair, then?

230
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,740
Of course not.

231
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,660
After the school's investigation,

232
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,820
we found

233
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,900
that those were just nonsense.

234
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,500
However, rumors were spreading non-stop.

235
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,940
We spoke to Ms. Yang Mei as well.

236
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,540
She chose to resign from her post.

237
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,300
However, Zhou Luo

238
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,580
didn't agree to the school
permitting Ms. Yang's resignation.

239
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,260
He stormed into the office

240
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,700
out of impulse.

241
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,180
I think

242
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,940
we must deal with this seriously.

243
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,580
You can't just fire Ms. Yang.

244
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,580
Zhou Luo?

245
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,220
Who told you to come here?
That was reckless of you.

246
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,060
What are you trying to do here?

247
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,380
You can't just fire Ms. Yang.

248
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,980
What did she do wrong?

249
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,620
Zhou Luo,

250
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,460
please mind your words.

251
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,660
What did she do wrong?

252
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,060
If you two did nothing wrong

253
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,980
and had a clear conscience,

254
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,500
why would people gossip about you

255
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,660
instead of other people?

256
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,860
I can't explain myself.

257
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,420
However, I'm honest and upright.

258
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,940
Honest and upright?

259
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,700
Instead of reflecting upon your actions,
you two are seeking excuses

260
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,260
after you got yourself in trouble.

261
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,020
Do you two think the people are blind?

262
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,220
You're slandering us!

263
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,180
What did we do?

264
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,580
What did you do?

265
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,420
We already received reports
of your wrongdoings.

266
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,940
You two can just wait for the results.

267
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,300
Zhou Luo.

268
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,460
Come here. Quickly.

269
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,860
You're already here.

270
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,820
Be sincere, okay?

271
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,020
Madam.

272
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,020
Is Mr. Zhang around?

273
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,940
He's still sick. He's not seeing anyone.

274
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,500
Madam...

275
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,740
Look, we're already here.

276
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
We bought the nourishment

277
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,180
especially for you two.

278
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,260
We came here today

279
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,260
because Zhou Luo wanted
to apologize to Mr. Zhang.

280
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,460
He'll admit his mistake sincerely.

281
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,500
Thank you, Madam.

282
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,660
Zhou Luo.

283
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,500
Come on.

284
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,300
Zhang, your students are here.

285
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,300
Mr. Zhang,

286
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,100
do you feel better now?

287
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,020
Mr. Zhang,

288
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,220
we bought these for you.

289
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,940
Mr. Zhang,

290
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,300
he knows his fault now.

291
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,100
He's remorseful about it.

292
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
He's truly remorseful.

293
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,540
He felt sorry for you.

294
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,780
I don't need your nourishment.

295
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,660
You may leave now.

296
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,700
Weren't you fearless?

297
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Go back to where you came from, then.

298
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,220
It wasn't a big deal in the first place.

299
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,340
It would've been over if you just
let Yang Mei resign from her post.

300
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,740
But you just wanted to act hero, huh?

301
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,660
Well, now,

302
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,980
if you two want to be together,
just do it.

303
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,420
Zhou Luo.

304
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,140
Mr. Zhang, we're sorry.

305
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,700
Zhou Luo!

306
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,980
Zhou Luo!

307
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
What do you mean by this?

308
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,780
Were you trying to hit me again?

309
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
Mr. Zhang, we're truly sorry.

310
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,860
What kind of person are you?

311
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,180
Zhou Luo!

312
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,780
Zhou Luo, stop right there!

313
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,900
Do you know the situation we're in?
Why are you still so impulsive?

314
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,980
You're already here.

315
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,340
Just let him scold you.

316
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,940
He has a filthy mind and a mouth.

317
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,860
I can't listen to him.

318
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,140
Hey, it's just a few sentences.

319
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,140
You don't need to take them to heart.

320
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,500
I didn't want to apologize to him.
He doesn't deserve it.

321
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,140
That's not the point here.

322
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,100
Aren't you going to attend university?

323
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,980
No.

324
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
Wait, Zhou Luo.
Why are you acting like a fool

325
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
at this particular moment?

326
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,140
There's no way I can bow
to a person like him.

327
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,300
If this is the kind of university
I'm attending,

328
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I would rather not attend it.

329
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,860
You...

330
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,700
Zhou Luo!

331
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,180
That punch

332
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,460
was quite a powerful blow.

333
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,220
Although Mr. Zhang
did say something terrible

334
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,980
back then,

335
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,180
Zhou Luo was

336
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,100
overreacting.

337
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,500
No matter what,

338
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,140
Mr. Zhang was his teacher.

339
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,060
He hit him first.

340
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,940
And he refused to apologize.

341
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,660
After that?

342
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,380
The school decided

343
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,060
that it was a malicious incident
of assaulting teachers.

344
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
We persuaded Mr. Zhang.

345
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,180
In the end, we decided
to take severe disciplinary action.

346
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,060
However, the prerequisite was

347
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,980
that Zhou Luo had
to write a deep reflection report

348
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,860
and apologize to Mr. Zhang.

349
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,340
He would rather be expelled

350
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,620
than apologize to him?

351
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,100
Yes. He was too stubborn.

352
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,140
He never thought

353
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,580
that he was wrong.

354
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,060
After that,

355
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,380
the school decided to expel him.

356
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,940
If so,

357
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,740
why did you change
the reason for his expulsion?

358
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,860
It was all because of his mother.

359
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,980
You know,

360
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
it's all about selfless parental love.

361
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,780
After his mother
heard about the incident,

362
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,500
she rushed to the school overnight

363
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,020
and went here and there

364
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,940
sobbing

365
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,900
and begging them to spare Zhou Luo.

366
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,260
As Zhou Luo used

367
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,780
to make a good performance,

368
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,660
the superiors in school

369
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,060
decided to spare him.

370
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,620
We didn't want to ruin his future.

371
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,540
Therefore, we agreed to their request
to change the reason for expulsion.

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,420
Also,

373
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,020
we didn't reveal
the real reason to the public.

374
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,780
That's it

375
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,260
for Zhou Luo's case.

376
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,980
If so, is Mr. Zhang around?

377
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,020
I wish to speak with him.

378
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,740
You should forget about it.

379
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,740
Well,

380
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,500
Zhou Luo hit him badly.

381
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,740
And he refused to apologize to him.

382
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,980
Even now,

383
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,340
this case still troubles him deeply.

384
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,060
What about this?

385
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,140
If you have any questions,

386
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
why don't you ask Ms. Yang directly?

387
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,540
I'll make the call for you.

388
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,660
I came to teach in Shanghai

389
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,580
because my husband

390
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,380
passed away in a car accident.

391
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,820
It was so sudden
that I couldn't accept it.

392
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,900
I was depressed

393
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,540
for a very long time.

394
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,660
I couldn't walk out from my grief.

395
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,620
I even contemplated suicide.

396
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,060
One weekend, we had a seminar.

397
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,220
I fell to the ground in a daze.

398
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,660
It was Zhou Luo
who rushed to me immediately.

399
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,180
He carried me

400
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,500
and sent me to the hospital.

start spreading after that?

404
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,620
Maybe.

405
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,140
Zhou Luo is a kind kid.

406
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,060
After that,

407
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,660
he would ask me out for meals

408
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,540
and chat with me from time to time.

409
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,260
He was just afraid
that I might be depressed.

410
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,020
If so, how will you describe

411
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,580
your relationship with him, then?

412
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,140
He's both my student and my friend.

413
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,420
Was he always this loyal

414
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,900
without caring about the consequences?

415
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,300
Zhou Luo's biggest weakness

416

is that he gets emotional easily.

[Common Confusions Found

418
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,900
He never makes compromises
once he's sure about something.

419
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,660
He loves to engage
in direct confrontations.

and the ways how people interact

mean nothing to him.

For certain things,

424
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
one has to pay the price.

425
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,740
That's why I agreed
to resign from my post immediately

after the school superior intervened.

427
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,060
I hid it from him as I was worried
that he might act impulsively.

428
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,580
I have no idea how he heard about it.

429
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,020
If so, do you think

430
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,620
that someone did it on purpose?

431

Maybe I'm just paranoid.

433
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,740
Zhou Luo is too impulsive.

434

If only he could bow to Mr. Zhang

and apologize to him back then.

436
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,380
The only thing I could do

437
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,740
was to negotiate with different parties.

438
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,460
Even so, I couldn't stop
Zhou Luo from being expelled.

439
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,540
I only managed to change
his reason for expulsion.

440
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,300
Actually, my relationship with Zhou Luo

441
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,260
wasn't a love relationship
like what the rumors said.

442
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,980
Zhou Luo is clean

443
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,740
and has a sense of justice.

444
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,380
He suffered a lot of grievances
due to the expulsion.

If so, Ms. Yang,

446
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,860
do you think

Zhou Luo

448
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,140

449
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,500
due to his kindness, innocence,

450
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,020
or impulsiveness?

451
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,460
I cannot make any judgment for you.

452
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,620
But if Zhou Luo said
that he saw it himself,

453
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,660
I believe that it must be the truth.

454
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,700
Are you going home?

00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,220

Where did you go?

457
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,020

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Was it a business trip?

459
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,380
I was investigating some minor details.

460
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,060
Why would you go through so much trouble
to investigate minor details?

461
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,020
Sometimes,

462
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,180
a single detail

463
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
can affect the verdict
of the entire case.

464
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,540
If so, what have you discovered?

465
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,620
Are you willing to tell me about

466
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,740

467
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,420
Didn't you already investigate that?

468
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,580
I want you

469
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,780
to tell me the answer.

470
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,580
Would you believe me
if I told you about it?

471
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,340
In this world, there's one type of thing

472
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
that never has a definite answer.

473
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,420
Truth only remains
in the heart of one who's involved.

474
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,140
It's pointless to talk more about it.

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,020
They found the body of Liu Xun's father.

476
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,540
They found it in a wild lake
in the suburbs.

477
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,940
When?

478
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,580
No idea.

479
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,980
Was it suicide? Or murder?

480
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,660
My father wasn't willing
to tell me anything.

481
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,460
But my guess is

482
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,620
Xu Yi did it.

the functions
of Trigonometric Function Models.

488
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,140

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,580
I need to ask you guys something.

494

Zhou Luo,

495
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,300
you may go.

496
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,020
Let's go.

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,940
Huashan Cram School is pretty famous.

500
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,340
I've heard

501
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,580
that it's hard to get in too.

502
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,260
It's kind of depressing studying here.

503
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,100
What do you guys think?

504
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,780
I think it's not that bad.

505
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,420
Mainly, it's because I want
to get into a police academy.

506
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,980
I've already chosen the tuition books

507
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,020
that I promised you.

508
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,740
I'll deliver them to you
once they arrive at my house.

509
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,100

513
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,260
There's no way
I can be admitted to a university.

514
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,780
I just want to get through this year.

515
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,940
What about Zhou Luo?

516
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,780
What do you guys think about him?

517
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,820
He's a top student.

518
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,540
He's totally different

519
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,940
in this cram school.

520
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,140
However, to us,

521
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,380
he's one of our best friends.

522
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,500
Fanglu,

523
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,820
just get straight to the point.

524
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,940
It's nothing.

525
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,580
I'm just having
a casual chat with you guys.

526
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,220
What do you guys

527
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,620
think about Zhou Luo's personality?

528
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
He's pretty nice.

529
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,940
Is that all?

530
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,340
He's smart,

531
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,580
kind,

532
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,620
and sincere.

533
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,060
And loyal.

534
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,780
Do you guys think

535
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,140
that Zhou Luo is an impulsive person?

536
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
He's a guy.

537
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,220
I think it's normal for a guy
to be impulsive.

538
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,140
What about getting beaten up

539
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,060
and sent to the hospital
because of a woman?

540
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,580
Would you do something like that?

541
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,300
I would.

542
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,820
I would be the first to fight

543
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,220
if someone tried to bully Bingbing.

544
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
If so, do Zhou Luo and Nan Ya
have this kind of relationship?

545
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,740
Nan Ya and Zhou Luo

546
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,500
are nothing more
than sister and brother.

547
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,820
Zhou Luo was acting courageously
for the right cause.

548
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,460
Is there anything wrong with him
protecting the weak?

549
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,620
No.

550
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,980
Nan Ya is

551
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,100
quite pitiful indeed.

552
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,020
I'm sure Zhou Luo desires

553
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,020
to protect her and help her out badly,

554
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:07,940
right?

555
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,140
He didn't do it of his own accord.

556
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,340
It was just a coincidence.

557
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,300
Since you all are good friends,

558
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,820
has Zhou Luo ever told you

559
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,860
about the real reason he quit school?

560
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,660
We're buddies.

561
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,860
Of course, I know that.

562
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,620
What did he tell you, then?

563
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,260
That's a secret among us.

564
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,460
We promised him

565
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,780
not to tell anyone else.

566
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,860
That's right.

567
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,980
It's a secret.

568
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,620
It's a secret between buddies.

569
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,260
Fine.

570
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,300
If so, I'll take it

571
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,380
as if we're on the same page here.

572
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,220
Then, do you think

573
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,700
Zhou Luo would fall

574
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,140
for a woman older than her?

575
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,420
For example, Nan Ya.

576
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,620
Fanglu, how is that possible?

577
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,060
You must be joking.

578
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,540
Yeah. His relationship with Nan Ya
isn't what you think.

579
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,540
That's right.

580
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,140
Are you sure about that?

581
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
It's because I'm the person he fancies.

582
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,260
I'm his girlfriend.

583
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,620
Seems like neither of them
knew about this.

584
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,820
That's right.

585
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,460
They had no idea.

586
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,300
It's because we promised each other

587
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,420
that we wouldn't tell anyone else.

588
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,780
Mainly, we didn't want
our parents to know.

589
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,820
That's why we didn't tell them.

590
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,420
We're going to go to Beijing
to attend university together.

591
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,620
You suspect Zhou Luo and Nan Ya
are in a relationship?

592
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,180
That's ridiculous.

593
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,540
They're not close to each other at all.

594
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,820
Not close, huh?

595
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,500
He got into a fight and was hospitalized

596
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,340
for her.

597
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
He took care of her child before.

598
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,420
And he's the only witness in her case.

599
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,100
They have the same taste in books.

600
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,020
They spent quite some time
with each other.

601
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,420
They even lived near each other.

602
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,780
As his girlfriend,

603
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,500
how could you not notice any of that?

604
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,740
That's nothing.

605
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,100
You didn't even know where he was

606
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,700
on such an important day
like the night of the millennium.

607
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,340
You couldn't even find him.

608
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,460
Does that mean nothing either?

609
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,100
It's because we were together
the entire night.

610
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,580
You guys were indeed together

611
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,020
before he left the riverbank.

612
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
But that night,

613
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
Zhou Luo was missing

614
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,300
for over an hour.

615
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,780
And it coincides with

616
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,060
the countdown.

617
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,780
Don't you mind that at all?

618
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,140
It's because we were together

619
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,980
during that one and a half hours.

620
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,100
But you said you couldn't find him

621
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,540
when I inquired you previously.

622
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,580
I didn't want other people to find out.

623
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,540
Find out about what?

624
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,220
That we were together.

625
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,340
Do you even need to hide that?

626
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,540
Yes.

627
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,300
Why?

628
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,100
It's because we did that kind of thing.

629
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,220
What do you mean?

630
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,420
The thing that a man would do
with a woman.

631
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,020
We didn't want our parents to find out.

632
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,180
That's why I lied to you and said

633
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,820
that I couldn't find him that night.

634
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,500
If so, what's driving you

635
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,180
to tell me

636
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,420
the truth now?

637
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,660
It's because you are backing us
into a corner.

638
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,820
I don't want you
to hurt Zhou Luo any longer.

639
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,860
Don't worry.

640
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,140
I'll keep this secret for you.

641
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,860
Regarding our conversation today,

642
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,940
I won't tell anyone else about it.

643
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,500
