[Episode 28]

2
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,300
I killed him.

3
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
What are you doing?

4
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,540
What are you doing, Zhou Luo?

5
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,620
Don't come in, Zhou Luo.

6
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,500
Don't come in, Zhou Luo.

7
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
Leave quickly.

8
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,300
Leave quickly.

9
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,340
I killed him.

10
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,780
What are you talking about?

11
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,420
I'm the one who did it.

12
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,700
Leave now.

13
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,220
Zhou Luo.

14
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,140
Nan Ya,

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,540
don't worry about anything else.

16
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,900
Listen to me.

17
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,380
I'm the one who killed him.

18
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,420
You can just leave.

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,260
No.

20
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,220
Zhou Luo, no.

21
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,100
I won't listen.

22
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,220
If you won't listen,

23
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,100
I'll go and turn myself in right now.

24
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,100
We're both covered in blood anyway.

25
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,140
Neither of us can explain it.

26
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,020
Say another word

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,700
and I'll kill myself in front of you!

28
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,540
I mean it.

29
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,380
Okay. Alright.

30
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,860
I won't say anything.

31
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,660
I won't.

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,380
I won't.

33
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,340
Nan Ya,

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,980
let's first clean the blood

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,780
off our hands, okay?

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,900
Let's clean the blood first.

37
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,460
Leave.

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,300
Leave.

[Tender Light]

50
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,780
It's okay.

51
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,580
Let's wash up.

52
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,580
Don't be afraid.

53
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,860
Don't be afraid.

54
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,180
Let's clean the blood first, okay?

55
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:26,980
Come on.

56
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,300
It's okay.

57
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,900
I'm here.

58
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,540
It's okay now.

59
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,900
I was holding the knife,

60
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,020
but it wasn't me.

61
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,180
I swear it wasn't me.

62
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,660
I didn't intend to kill him.

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,900
I know.

64
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,300
I know.

65
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,620
Nan Ya.

66
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,060
Do you believe me, Nan Ya?

67
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,300
Now, I need you

68
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,860
to tell me

69
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,140
everything that happened

70
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,700
after you came home.

71
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,380
Don't miss a single detail.

72
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,580
Okay?

73
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,060
Chen Jun.

74
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,900
Chen Jun.

75
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,980
Happy Millennium!

76
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,100
You too.

77
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,820
Did you make a wish?

78
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,420
I did.

79
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,860
Isn't Zhou Luo with you guys?

80
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,140
He's with Qingli now.

81
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,180
Don't worry.

82
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,420
Auntie Guixiang, don't worry.

83
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,820
Okay.

84
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,420
Let's watch the fireworks.

85
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,700
Happy Millennium!

86
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,660
Tell my mom to make a wish.

87
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
Make a wish.

88
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
Look at that.

89
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,060
That one's beautiful too.

90
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
It wasn't me.

91
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,660
It was Xu Yi himself.

92
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,220
I can tell the police

93
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,340
that Xu Yi was holding my hand

94
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,460
and killed himself.

95
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,980
It wasn't me.

96
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,300
No one will believe me, right?

97
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,100
Nan Ya,

98
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,220
I have a way

99
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,180
for both of us

100
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,260
to avoid jail time.

101
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,740
Nan Ya,

102
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,740
I have a solution.

103
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,660
I saw Xu Yi assaulting you,

104
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,340
chasing and attacking you.

105
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,980
You acted in self-defense

106
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,180
and accidentally killed him.

107
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,260
This way,
you won't have to go to prison.

108
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,780
I'll testify for you.

109
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,100
No,

110
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,940
you mustn't get involved in this matter.

111
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,340
This is the only way now.

112
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,140
We'll both be fine

113
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,340
as long as I testify for you.

114
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,460
Zhou Luo, listen to me.

115
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,820
You need to leave right now.

116
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,380
You've never been here.

117
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,980
This is not a joke.

118
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,500
I'll do whatever you say afterward.
But you have to do as I say this time.

119
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,580
It's absolutely not a joke.

120
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,620
You've never been here.

121
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,540
Burn your clothes.

122
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,420
Nan Ya,

123
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,580
this is the only way.

124
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,340
What can you do otherwise?

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,180
You have a promising future.

126
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,140
Don't destroy it for me.

127
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,580
You also have Guixiang.

128
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,860
Think about yourself.

129
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,700
I'll be fine.

130
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
You should think about yourself.

131
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,340
What about you?

132
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,140
A life for a life.

133
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,980
Then what about Wanwan?

134
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,900
Without parents,

135
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,060
how will she survive?

136
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,660
What will happen to Wanwan?

137
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,940
I've already found a place in Beijing.

138
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,500
It's a lively neighborhood,

139
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,820
dotted with bookstores

140
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,780
and video stores.

141
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,580
I want to hold your hand

142
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,060
and stroll down the bustling streets
with you.

143
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,100
Chang'an Avenue is wide and long.

144
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,140
From Jingshan Park, you can see

145
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,020
the magnificent Forbidden City.

146
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,340
I'll earn lots of money.

147
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,380
Wanwan will recover from her illness,

148
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,300
and she'll go to school.

149
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,100
In summer,

150
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,540
I want to go boating
in Houhai with you.

151
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,260
In winter, we'll eat hot pot together.

152
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,740
Nan Ya,

153
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,540
such a beautiful life
is right in front of us.

154
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,100
Don't you want it?

155
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,180
Nan Ya,

156
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,420
the good days are right in front of us.

157
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
Don't you want
to live that kind of life?

158
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,060
I can't wish for such a life anymore.

159
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,540
You just need to listen to me.

160
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,060
I promise both of us will be fine,

161
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,740
and Wanwan won't lose her mom.

162
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,100
We can still go to Beijing together.

163
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,860
You were acting in self-defense.

164
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,220
I saw Xu Yi assaulting you

165
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,020
and trying to attack you.

166
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,260
You just wanted to protect yourself,

167
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,700
so you accidentally killed him.

168
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,580
We are pressed for time.

169
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,820
We have to decide now.

170
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,100
Everything will be fine.

171
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,020
It's okay.

172
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,180
You've been wanting a divorce.

173
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,540
Xu Yi disagreed

174
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,340
and threatened to take Wanwan away.

175
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,380
You couldn't bear it.

176
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,180
It was supposed to be brought
to an end tonight.

177
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
So you told Xu Yi

178
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,740
you had evidence of his crimes.

179
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,940
How dare you threaten me!

180
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,940
You two had a fierce argument.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,420
Xu Yi attacked you again,

182
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,820
forcing you to hand out the photos.

183
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,700
You refused

184
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,380
and insisted that he had to sign
the divorce agreement.

185
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,340
Xu Yi didn't know what you were hiding

186
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,260
and went crazy.

187
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,060
He tried to kill you to silence you.

188
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,340
He was going to choke you to death.

189
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,100
You couldn't breathe

190
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,900
and were about to pass out.

191
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
You struggled desperately,

192
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,380
and then

193
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,100
you felt a knife
on the table beside you.

194
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,580
You grabbed it

195
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,820
and stabbed Xu Yi from behind.

196
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,700
He screamed in pain.

197
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,580
You wanted to escape,

198
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,980
but he pulled out the knife

199
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,260
and chased you with an axe.

200
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,740
You were terrified

201
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,700
and fell to the ground.

202
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,140
Xu Yi.

203
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,900
You pointed the knife at him

204
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,980
and told him not to come closer,

205
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,820
but Xu Yi approached you with an axe.

206
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,260
You closed your eyes
and waved the knife.

207
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,580
When you opened your eyes,

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
you found the knife
stuck in Xu Yi's body.

209
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,300
Then you realized

210
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,860
he slipped on leftovers on the ground,

211
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,700
slid towards you,

212
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,060
and bumped into the knife.

213
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,340
That's when I appeared

214
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,580
at your doorstep.

215
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,020
I was seeing Wanwan home.

216
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,380
After Xu Yi fell,

217
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,100
you heard footsteps running away,

218
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,060
but when you looked up,
you didn't see anyone.

219
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,700
The shoe marks are fabricated,

220
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
making it easy to spot the flaws.

221
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,340
So, you have to say

222
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,740
that after Xu Yi fell,

223
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,700
you were terrified.

224
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,020
You held him, trying to save him.

225
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,340
You covered his chest,

226
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,340
but he soon stopped breathing.

227
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,460
Now, we are so pressed for time.

228
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,020
In two hours, the body

229
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,340
will start showing signs
of livor mortis.

230
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,660
We don't have time
to rehearse repeatedly.

231
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,260
Make sure you firmly imprint

232
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,140
every detail

233
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,820
of what I've just told you
into your mind,

234
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,140
and keep visualizing it.

235
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,860
Got it?

236
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,620
Okay.

237
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,300
I need to rush back
to the riverside immediately,

238
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,380
find an excuse

239
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,940
to see Wanwan back,

240
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,540
and then pretend to witness
the crime scene.

241
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,700
While I'm away,

242
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,140
you need to lock the door,

243
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,260
and ensure all traces

244
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,220
are cleaned thoroughly.

245
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,420
You must clean them carefully,
understand?

246
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,660
Don't worry.

247
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
What should we do?

248
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,740
Oh no.

249
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,380
The police will definitely notice

250
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,700
the timing of this last call.

251
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,660
If I were away from the riverside
for too long

252
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,700
and Xu Yi didn't answer the phone,

253
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,460
they would suspect

254
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
he might have been dead by now.

255
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,140
The fact

256
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,940
that I was an eyewitness
to your self-defense

257
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,260
would be less plausible.

258
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,180
Where is Xu Yi's coat?

259
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,180
Nan Ya.

260
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,020
Nan Ya.

261
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,940
Where is Xu Yi's coat?

262
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,980
It's upstairs.

263
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,580
I need you to cooperate with me
and put on an act.

264
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,940
We have to change

265
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,220
the time of Xu Yi's death.

266
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,820
Hurry up.

267
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,460
Xu Yi!

268
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,420
If you don't hit me to death today,
I'll divorce you!

269
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,460
Zhou!

270
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,900
Come here.

271
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,020
What's going on?

272
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,340
Is Nan Ya

273
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,060
fighting with Xu Yi over there?

274
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,180
Xu Yi!

275
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,820
Why are they fighting?

276
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,380
Who knows?

277
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,220
You must be mistaken.

278
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,020
No.

279
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,580
Look. It must be them.

280
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Can't they even stop fighting
during the New Year?

281
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,940
Zhou.

282
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,980
What's going on?

283
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,140
I'll go find our son.

284
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,100
Keep it safe.

285
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,500
The admission notice is in it.
Don't lose it.

286
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,900
Got it.

287
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,060
Why are they doing this
during the New Year?

288
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,180
Go now.

289
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,780
Go.

290
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,140
You go home first.

291
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
I'll go pick up Wanwan,

292
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
and then I'll come over.

293
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,060
Zhou Luo.

294
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,180
Zhou Luo, is that you?

295
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,300
Don't run away.

296
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,820
Luo.

297
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:26,860
Zhou Luo.

298
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:31,900
Zhou Luo.

299
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,660
Everyone's looking for you.

300
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,940
Why?

301
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,220
We are looking for you...

302
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,500
We are looking for you
to do the countdown.

303
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,020
Okay.

304
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,820
All right then.

305
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,260
Let's head to the riverside now.

306
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,340
Zhou Luo,

307
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,340
I have something to tell you.

308
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,060
What do you want to say?

309
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,660
I...

310
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:56,980
Never mind.

311
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,940
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

312
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,220
No, Zhou Luo.

313
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,340
I must say it today.

314
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,580
You can say it by the riverside.

315
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,260
I only want to tell this to you alone.

316
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,220
I don't want to listen right now.

317
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,980
Zhou Luo, just hear me out.

318
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,420
What are you dragging your feet for?

319
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,420
Are you okay?

320
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,780
Are you alright?

321
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,020
Let go of me!

322
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,700
Why are you in a daze?

323
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,940
The child has fallen asleep.

324
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,620
Hurry, get the clothes.

325
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,260
Get the clothes.

326
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Yes, cover her with it.

327
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,700
Put her on the chair.

328
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,660
Put her on the chair.

329
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,900
Come on.

330
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,460
Be careful.

331
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,900
She's heavy.

332
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:50,860
Careful.

333
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,300
How come she suddenly fell asleep?

334
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,220
Here, her scarf.

335
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,260
Luo.

336
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,260
Where did you go?

337
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,820
I went back to take some medicine.

338
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,620
Then I had a nap.

339
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,340
Why are you sweating so much?

340
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,900
A car is on fire over there.

341
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,860
You saw it?

342
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,620
Yes.

343
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,180
Are you okay?

344
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm fine.

345
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,860
You scared me.

346
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,820
Chen.

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,260
There's a car on fire

348
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,580
near the internet cafe.

349
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,540
It's burning fiercely.

350
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,900
I'll be back soon.

351
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Move aside.

352
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,900
Both of you, come with me.

353
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,820
Make way, please.

354
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
As long as you're okay.

355
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm glad you're okay.

356
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,780
Wanwan's mom
hasn't come back yet, right?

357
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,940
She hasn't come back all night.

358
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,180
Wanwan cried all night,
saying she wanted her mom.

359
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,020
What are you doing?

360
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,580
I'll see her back
for her to sleep.

361
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,900
Luo.

362
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,700
It's too late.

363
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,660
Tonight,

364
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,060
let her sleep at our place.

365
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,860
It's New Year.

366
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,500
I think it's better for her to sleep

367
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,100
with her mom.

368
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,940
Wait.

369
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,940
Put this on her.

370
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't catch a cold.

371
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,140
When you go back,

372
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,740
check

373
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,260
if they're still arguing or not.

374
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,340
Okay.

375
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,500
Make it quick, yeah?

376
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll go now.

377
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,300
Be careful.

378
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,020
Wanwan,

379
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,020
you sleep here for a while.

380
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,100
Don't go anywhere.

382
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,220
Nan Ya, are you okay?

383
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,820
Did everything go smoothly?

384
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,580
Someone set fire to Xu Yi's car.

385
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,020
I threw everything there,

386
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,140
and they were all destroyed.

387
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,500
Where's Wanwan?

388
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,780
I've carried her to the doorway.
She's asleep now.

389
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,540
We must make it real enough.

390
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,180
I'll take her back to my place now.

391
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,940
After she's asleep, I'll come over.

392
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm leaving.

393
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,860
I'm exhausted.

394

As for that burning car,

395
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,180
do you think it has something to do
with Zhou Luo?

396
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,860
I heard Zhang Huashan calling his name.

397
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,300
Did you see him?

398
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,140
Of course, I didn't see him.

399
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,780
Then you shouldn't overthink it.

400
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Is our son asleep?

401
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,020
Should I go check on him?

402
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,340
No need.

403
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,540
He should be asleep.

404
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,980
Do you remember

405
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,780
what I told you?

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,700

I will prove your innocence.

Nan Ya, you have to promise me.

00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,420
No matter what happens in the future,

411
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,540
we'll stick to our story.

412
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,420
That is exactly what happened.

413
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,940
You don't need to be afraid.

414
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,020
Trust me.

415
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,980

[Qingshui Police Station]

419
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,740
Zhou Luo has been summoned

420

for over twelve hours.

421
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,140
If he doesn't speak up,

422
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,260
we'll need to release him tomorrow.

423
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,700
Should we try another bluff?

424
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,060
Who is it?

425
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,140
It's me.

Hu Xiu is dead.

427
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,860
She died today.

428
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,620
I already knew

429
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,500
that Xu Yi killed Hu Lifan.

430
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,780
Is this partly

431
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,900
why you two were together?

432
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,380
Yes.

433
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,180
He helped you kill someone,

434
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,980
and you married him.

435
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,420
So why divorce him then?

436
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,020
Have you ever loved Xu Yi?

437
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,860
I was scared of him,

438
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,900
pitied him,

439
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,860
and once felt indebted to him.

440
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
If it wasn't for me,

441
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,620
he wouldn't have killed Hu Lifan.

442
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,180
But that was what happened.

443
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,540
It was irrevocable.

444
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,740
We both started on the wrong path.

445
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,780
Yeah.

446
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,780
You've carried such a heavy burden
of a murder case.

447
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,020
So you can only stay
in the darkness forever.

448
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,940
No kind of affection

449
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,740
can cover up that fear

450
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,980
and that pain.

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,060
One mistake

452
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,660
leads to a chain of mistakes.

There's no turning back.

454
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,300
I'm the dumbest one.

It's been seven years.

457
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,660
and hated the wrong person.

458
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,740
It feels like a dream.

00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,900
Chen Ling,

460
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,020
you should leave.

461
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,780
Get away from here,

467
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,540
Fate is truly an absurd thing,

into rivals.

All these years,

471
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,740
I've kept thinking of us
sleeping in the same bed,

472
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,300
and whispering to each other.

473
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,340
We were just two little girls,

474
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,100

So let's go our separate ways.

478
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,180
Alright.

479
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,820

480
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,020
Oh, by the way,

of Xu Yi's knife wound.

It wasn't self-defense.

489

I planned it for a long time

490
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,020
just to exonerate myself.

491
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,580
Zhou Luo was also part of my plan.

492
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,500

00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,700
you exactly anticipated the time

Zhou Luo would arrive at your door?

495
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,460
Yeah.

Whether he saw the whole process or not,

498
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,260
he would definitely testify for me.

Do you want to take the blame
for Zhou Luo?

00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,380
Do you suspect
that Zhou Luo killed Xu Yi?

501
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,020
Yes.

502
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,380
How could a person

503
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,660
possibly fake such a scene on her own?

504
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,300
I didn't fake the scene.

505

That was simply what I planned.

If Xu Yi didn't die,

507

I can't go to jail.

his involvement in the bridge case,

512

and the fact he killed Hu Lifan

to deliberately provoke him.

514
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,060
Actually, I had hidden the axe
in the corner long ago.

While avoiding his attack,

516
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,780
I intentionally led him there

and said things
that would drive him crazy.

What did you say?

519
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,020
I said that I'd already fallen in love
with someone else.

520
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,180
Who is this someone?

521
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,500
Is it Zhou Luo?

00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,420
Otherwise, why else do you think

523
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,340
that tape would be in the recorder?

524
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,980
And why would Zhou Luo

525
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,100
suddenly show up at my doorstep?

526
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,740
So are you saying

527
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,580
this is a murder

528
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,420

529
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,220
Yes.

530
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,060
While Xu Yi was getting the axe,

531
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,540
I took out the knife
I had prepared beforehand

532
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,220
and stabbed him to death.

533
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,340
So what's the relationship

534
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,060
between you and Zhou Luo?

535
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,940
What relationship?

536
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,020
I was just taking advantage of him.

537
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,980
How could I possibly
fall in love with him?

538
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,500
Taking advantage of men's affection

539
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,460
is a life skill I've mastered.

540
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Do you find it despicable?

541
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,980
Isn't this fair?

542
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,260
They always want
to get something from me.

543
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
If they can't,

544
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,500
they will slander, threaten,
and smear me.

545
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,860
Shouldn't I take advantage of them?

546
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,700
Am I destined to be weak,

547
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,140
to endure everything,

548
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,020
and to wait for others to save me?

549
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,260
Is that what you are thinking?

550
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,700
Since you've planned everything
so meticulously,

551
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,940
why did you come to turn yourself in?

552
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,460
The people I hated are all dead anyway.

553
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,380

take her back.

557

Just as you said,

558
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,140
for either murder

559
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
or faking the crime scene,

560
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,820
the penalty won't be light.

561

00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,060
Your mom is waiting for you at home.

569
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,460
Nan Ya has already confessed.

570
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,540
You were used by her.

571
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,740
Go back.

572
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,860
And once you're back,

573
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
don't dwell on it.

574
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,420
Forget about it all.

575
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,140
In the future, when you go to Beijing,

576
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,660
you'll find yourself

577
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,980
farther and farther away
from everything here.

578
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,940
All things

579
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,220
will pass.

580
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:55,610
♪Dear, my beloved♪

581
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,770
♪Believe me at least♪

582
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:07,720
♪Without you, languishes my heart♪

583
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,650
♪Dear, my beloved♪

584
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,550
♪Believe me at least♪

585
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:31,300
♪Without you, languishes my heart♪

586
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,740
That isn't

587
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,060
the truth.

588
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,300
We'll just stand here.

589
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,860
There's a light here

590
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,820
that can cast our shadows on the wall,

591
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,420
making it look more real.

592
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:33,900
I never thought

593
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,100
our first time standing together

594
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,940
openly

595
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,740
would turn out like this.

596
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,700
Zhou Luo,

597
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,900
I can't do this.

598
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,340
What are you talking about?

599
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:05,980
I can't do this.

600
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,340
No,

601
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,220
you can.

602
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,420
Trust me.

603
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,060
Trust me.

604
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,580
Nan Ya,

605
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,300
I'll take you away from here.

606
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,860
Now hit me.

607
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,540
Quickly.

608
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
Before they come back.

609
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,580
I am a murderer.

610
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,940
No.

611
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,260
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

612
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,980
No, you're not.

613
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,700
It was self-defense.

614
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,300
I can make sure both of us will get away

615
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,100
and leave this place.

616
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,380
Before they come back,

617
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,740
hit me.

618
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,540
Quickly,

619
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,900
hit me.

620
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,460
Come on, hit me.

621
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,100
Hit me!

622
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,660
Quickly, hit me.

623
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,740
Come on, hit me.

624
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,660
Hit me now.

625
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,500
Hit me!

626
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,740
Quick, hit me.

627
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,740
Come on.

628
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,260
Xu Yi!

629
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,140
If you don't hit me to death today,

630
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,540
I'll divorce you!

631
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,540
Bro,

632
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,540
I remember when you just came
to Qingshui Town,

633
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,820
you told me

634
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,100
that what solves a case

635
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,900
is patience.

636
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,660
Nonsense.

637
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,180
You are

638
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,700
just a gambler.

639
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,460
How do you know

640
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,260
that Chen Ling can convince Nan Ya?

641
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,780
You said it yourself.

642
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,460
I'm just a gambler.

643
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,140
But you know what?

644
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,620
I wasn't betting on Chen Ling.

645
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,740
What were you betting on then?

646
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,500
I was betting on the fact

647
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,500
that their feelings
for each other were true.

648
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,180
Chen,

649
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,740
I want to share a secret with you.

650
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,300
My dad

651
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,540
used to abuse my mom as well,

652
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,020
and he hit her badly.

653
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,620
One night when I was in high school,

654
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,020
he hit her again.

655
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,140
I grabbed a piece of a broken bowl

656
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,940
and held it to his neck.

657
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,220
I told him,

658
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,340
"If you ever dare to lay a finger
on my mom again,

659
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,300
I'll kill you."

660
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,540
It was a split-second decision.

661
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,060
If I hadn't been able

662
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,180
to control myself at that moment,

663
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,900
I would've been a murderer too.

664
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,220
I can understand.

665
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,140
I do.

666
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,220
No, you don't.

667
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,140
You can never understand.

668
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,460
[Defendant Nan Ya
voluntarily surrendered]

669
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,270
[to the judicial authorities]

670
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,360
[and truthfully confessed to the crime.]

671
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,350
[Considering
that she surrendered herself,]

672
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,210
[she was given a lighter sentence
according to law.]

673
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,050
[Nan Ya was convicted
of intentional injury]

674
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,010
[and sentenced to ten years in prison.]

675
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,490
[Defendant Zhou Luo aided Nan Ya
in faking the crime scene,]

676
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,630
[committing perjury,
obstructing justice,]

677
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,230
[and concealing
Nan Ya's criminal activities.]

678
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,580
[He was convicted of concealment
and sentenced to ten months in prison.]

679
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,570
[Defendant Liu Xun, for arson]

680
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,110
[and intentional destruction
of property,]

681
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:40,630
[was sentenced to two years in prison.]

682
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,560
[Defendant Chen Ling,
for participating in arson]

683
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,120
[and intentional destruction
of property,]

684
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,640
[was sentenced to one year in prison.]

685
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,720
[Defendant Jiang Zhi,
for tearing up important evidence]

686
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,330
[related to the case, and aiding
in the destruction of evidence,]

687
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:44,810
[was sentenced to one year in prison.]

688
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:45,590
[Defendant Xu Jian,
for obstructing justice]

689
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,550
[and being held criminally responsible
for the collapse of the bridge,]

690
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,090
[was sentenced to two years in prison.]

691
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,870
[Six years later]

692
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,260
I'll serve the dishes.

693
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,460
Do you think this train will be delayed?

694
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,580
After all,
it's the Spring Festival travel rush.

695
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,020
You miss your daughter, don't you?

696
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,140
That's not it.

697
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,460
Mom, Dad.

698
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,380
I'm back.

699
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,060
She's back.

700
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,380
Qingli.

701
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,500
Qingli.

702
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,100
Mom.

703
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,260
You are back.

704
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,860
Mom.

705
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,060
My daughter is getting
more and more beautiful.

706
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,740
These are things
I bought for you and Dad.

707
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,460
Let me take it.

708
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:47,340
Take her luggage.

709
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,020
Qingli.

710
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:48,860
Dad.

711
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,380
Take a seat.

712
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,540
I'll take your luggage.

713
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:51,900
Qingli.

714
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,460
Be careful.

715
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:52,900
Qingli.

716
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,500
It's a bit heavy.

717
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,540
Hurry.

718
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,300
Take a seat.

719
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,580
Are you tired?

720
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,180
I'm alright.

721
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,260
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

722
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,180
Welcome home.

723
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,140
Thank you, Mom.

724
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,620
Thank you, Dad.

725
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,780
Qingli,

726
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,100
you'll be twenty-seven
after the Chinese New Year.

727
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,780
It's important to make progress
in your career,

728
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,900
but your personal life
can't be neglected either,

729
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,460
right?

730
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,140
Exactly.

731
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,820
Are there any young men
in your company that you like?

732
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,420
The company
doesn't allow office romances.

733
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,860
You're working overtime every day,

734
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,460
and are always so busy.

735
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,580
How can you find a boyfriend?

736
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,100
Enough about that.

737
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,980
Let's eat now.

738
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,700
Alright.

739
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,020
Come on,

740
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:51,820
let's eat.

741
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,420
Here,

742
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,140
eat more.

743
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,220
Mom,

744
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,540
how is he?

745
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,900
Who are you talking about?

746
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,180
Let's drink.

747
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,460
Zhou Luo.

748
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,420
After he came out,

749
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,420
he opened an internet cafe in town,

750
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,700
right at the location
of Nan Ya's clothing store.

751
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,540
He's been taking care
of the sick child, Wanwan.

752
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,140
Two years ago,

753
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,020
Lin Fanglu helped to find
a hospital in the province

754
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,020
for surgery,

755
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,500
which was successful.

756
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,740
Is Officer Lin still working in town?

757
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,900
He has been transferred back
to the Provincial PSB.

758
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,380
Qingli, do you know

759
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,020
that Nan Ya's case was rejudged?

760
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,860
It's said that the police

761
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,340
found evidence

762
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,420
of Xu Yi's suicide
through that tape later on.

763
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,500
Chen,

764
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:15,300
there's a new technology
in the Provincial PSB now.

765
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,500
I'm going to reapply

766
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,820
for evidence examination

767
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,060
of the damaged tape
found at Nan Ya's house.

768
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,460
Officer Lin, you go in first.

769
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,340
I'll go submit the documents
and catch up with you in a bit.

770
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,100
[Identification Bureau]

771
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,020
Is Mr. Li here?

772
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,980
I'm Lin Fanglu.

773
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,420
Officer Lin, right?

774
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,660
So, this is the evidence
I want to restore.

775
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,580
Alright, please wait for a moment.

776
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,300
Thank you.

777
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,540
Officer Lin.

778
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,100
Officer Lin?

779
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:09,860
Mr. Li.

780
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,740
You didn't go back?

781
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,100
I fell asleep.

782
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,300
Has the result come out yet?

783
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,060
One sec.

784
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,460
How's it?

785
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,020
The result of the examination shows

786
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,980
that there's a very clear male voice
in the background.

787
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,060
Male voice?

788
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,500
Yes.

789
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,300
Okay.

790
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,860
Chen,

791
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,180
this is Lin Fanglu.

792
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,980
The examination report is out.

793
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,740
The voice in the tape

794
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,780
is Xu Yi's.

795
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,660
I have the sample in my hands now.

796
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:11,780
Listen.

797
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,980
I won't let them take me
to the execution ground

798
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,380
and shoot me.

799
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,060
I want you to feel
what it's like to kill someone.

800
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,380
Like me,

801
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,460
you'll live the rest of your life

802
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,980
with blood on your hands.

803
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,940
Let's see if any man
will still want you.

804
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,260
Come on,

805
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,380
kill me!

806
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,500
Come on.

807
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,380
Come on.

808
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,300
Stab me here.

809
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,140
Here.

810
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,300
Stab me here.

811
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,380
Stab me.

812
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,820
Come on!

813
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,880
[Nan Ya's case underwent a retrial]

814
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:55,240
[by judicial authorities
and was rejudged.]

815
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,380
Uncle,

816
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,180
I'll put them away for you.

817
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,260
Sure.

818
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,500
Can you carry it?

819
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,620
Yes.

820
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,820
Be careful.

821
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,300
Rib Noodle Soup.

822
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,620
Careful, it's hot.

823
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,820
Come on, give me the chopsticks.

824
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:37,420
Zhou Luo.

825
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,180
Why do you like physics?

826
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,220
Human beings are so insignificant,

827
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,860
yet the world outside is so vast.

828
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,580
Physics is the tool
to explore the future world.

829
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,860
Do you believe in the future?

830
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,420
What we encounter is really nothing

831
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:06,820
more than a series
of random and disorganized problems.

832
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,260
And the future

833
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,780
