00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 21]

2
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,340
Zhou Luo is an honest child
who says what he sees.

3
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,660
Nan Ya does have a bad reputation.

4
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,580
However, we can't just wrong her.

5
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,300
Our family has no grievances with Xu Yi.

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,860
But Xu Yi's family is saying
that we're siding with Nan Ya.

7
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,180
Luo?

8
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,620
Zhou Luo?

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,420
What's in it for us
if we're siding with Nan Ya?

10
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,700
That day, Xu Yi argued with her

11
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,620
at my stall.

12
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,180
He hit her at the dam.

13
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,700
Everyone saw that.

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,940
I didn't see him at all.

15
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,420
I didn't see him for the entire night.

16
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,940
I looked everywhere
but couldn't find him.

17
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,060
He was sleeping at home.

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,820
He came back after he woke up.

19
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,260
It's not a big deal
whether he saw the fireworks or not.

20
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,780
What are you doing?

21
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,460
I'm carrying her back home
for her to sleep.

22
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,220
Luo!

23
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,860
It's too late.

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,340
Just let her spend the night
at our house tonight.

25
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,940
It's New Year.
I think it's better for her

26
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,460
to spend the night with her mother.

27
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,180
Be quick, then.

28
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
I'll go, then.

29
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,260
Be careful.

30
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,300
Xu Yi was inhuman

31
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,140
when he got angry.

32
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,180
I know that best.

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,540
Zhou Luo was going
to take the college entrance exam soon.

34
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,140
He was terrified

35
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
when he saw that!

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,060
I was even going
to demand compensation from them!

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,050
[Tender Light]

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,580
Zhang Huashan has gone too far.

39
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,380
The way he treats us is like
we're the plague.

40
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,700
He doesn't even
allow Qingli to talk to us.

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,900
Yeah.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,300
Her father has really gone too far.

43
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,140
Besides, Qingli's grades have improved
during this period.

44
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,700
It's good for her to stay away from me.

45
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420
Tell her this on my behalf.

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,140
Tell her to stop fighting
with her father.

47
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,300
She'll be free
once she gets into a university.

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,100
Mom.

49
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,340
Luo.

50
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,340
Mom, what's wrong?

51
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,140
Why didn't you tell me anything?

52
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,020
You never told me anything
ever since you came back from school.

53
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,580
You still didn't tell me anything

54
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,580
when you got yourself
in such huge trouble.

55
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,460
I'm your mother, you know?

56
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm not anyone else.

57
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,900
Do you wish to drive me to death?

58
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
That's not it, Mom.

59
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,580
That's not what I meant.

60
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,900
Or,

61
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,100
was it because you think
that I'm uneducated

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,540
and that I couldn't understand it
even if you told me about it?

63
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,260
How could that be? That's not the case.

64
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,460
Then why?

65
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,540
Why exactly did you do so?

66
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,020
Why did you get yourself
into such a huge mess?

67
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,540
I won't do it again.

68
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,700
Luo.

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,900
Tell me.

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
What exactly did you see

71
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,460
that night?

72
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,540
Mom, don't...

73
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,260
Don't let your imagination run wild.

74
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,460
It's all my fault.

75
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,060
It's all my fault!

76
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,260
Why did I have to make you
send Wanwan home?

77
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,500
Why did I have to make my son
witness such things?

78
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,420
I...

79
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,900
I truly regret it so much!

80
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,500
Mom.

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,580
What I saw that night

82
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,700
won't affect my performance on the exam.

83
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,300
Luo,

84
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,500
you're my pride.

85
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,500
No one in Qingshui Town

86
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,060
can compare to you.

87
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,580
I often thought

88
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,420
that

89
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,900
your father and I were so lucky

90
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,260
to have an outstanding son like you.

91
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,100
Mom, what are you saying?

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm serious.

93
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,260
I just want you to be successful.

94
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,820
I don't need you to support me

95
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,020
after you become successful.

96
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,900
I don't need you to give me anything.

97
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,180
I don't want anything from you.

98
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm just worried that...

99
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,460
That I couldn't protect you

100
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,620
or help you to be successful,

101
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,660
you know?

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,340
When I took you back from Shanghai,

103
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,260
it was like
there was a huge piece of rock

104
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
laying on my chest.

105
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,140
I couldn't breathe.

106
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,340
Did you know how happy I was

107
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,380
when you brought

108
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,020
Jinghua's grade reduction notice back?

109
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,140
Only then

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
was I able to catch my breath again.

111
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
But now, I...

112
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,740
There was not a single night
that I could sleep in peace.

113
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,900
There's a police living upstairs.

114
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,580
He...

115
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,700
At first, I thought he was

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,140
only an ordinary tenant.

117
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,140
However,

118
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,780
the more I thought about it,
the more it felt off.

119
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,660
I thought something was off.

120
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,260
Why is he keeping
such a close eye on my son?

121
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,780
Why?

122
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
It's because
I'm the only witness in the case.

123
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,420
He has to investigate
the case thoroughly

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,300
to prove Nan Ya's innocence.

125
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,180
If so,

126
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,420
were you telling the truth?

127
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,540
Mom, everything I said was true.

128
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,420
Really?

129
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,100
Yes.

130
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,340
Let's just put everything aside

131
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,980
and get into a university,

132
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,820
okay?

133
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,540
Okay.

134
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,500
Mom, I promise you.

135
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,460
Let's get into a good university,

136
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,940
okay?

137
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,380
Okay.

138
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,940
Mom, you should go to sleep.

139
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,020
Luo,

140
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,540
you should sleep too.

141
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,380
Have a good rest.
I'll close the door for you.

142
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,260
Between my lover and me, 300 long nights

143
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,220
will be erected like 300 high walls.

144
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
And the sea

145
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
will be a magic show between us.

146
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,500
The cruel hand of time

147
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,580
will tear apart

148
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,380
the streets

149
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,180
that pierce my chest like thorns.

150
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,700
There will be nothing left

151
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,940
but memories.

152
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,620
The dusk is given by sadness.

153
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,100
The night that longs for you.

154
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,060
The decadent wilderness.

155
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,980
The poor sky is

156
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,980
humiliated in the bottom
of the puddles...

157
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Are you having an affair with Zhou Luo?

158
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,060
Zhou.

159
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,340
Zhou?

160
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,500
Zhou!

161
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,460
We cannot let Zhou Luo
attend Huashan Cram School anymore.

162
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,260
Zhou Luo must leave this place

163
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,300
and stay away from all these messes.

164
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,260
Where can

165
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,020
he go?

166
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,860
Anywhere is fine

167
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,580
as long as he leaves Qingshui Town.

168
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
We can't wait any longer.

169
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,820
Therefore,

170
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,540
BE is perpendicular to CF.

171
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,700
Got it?

172
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,580
Yes.

173
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,260
Good.

174
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,780
Alright. Class's over.

175
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,060
Luo.

176
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,740
Sir.

177
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,420
Nice to meet you.

178
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,260
Mom?

179
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,060
What are you doing here?

180
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,020
Is class over?

181
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,060
Was that the Math class?

182
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,460
Let's go.

183
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,860
Don't worry.

184
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,380
Leave Zhou Luo to me.

185
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,620
Why is my uncle here?

186
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,220
Dad.

187
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,020
Uncle.

188
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,340
Open the door.

189
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,820
Where...

190
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,460
Where are we going?

191
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,580
I've already packed your belongings.

192
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,900
Your uncle will send you
to Shanghai right now.

193
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,420
Wait. Why so suddenly?
I'm not going.

194
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,740
Listen to me. Just tell me
if you need anything, okay?

195
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
I'll mail them to you
when you arrive in Shanghai.

196
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,660
I'm not going to Shanghai!

197
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,980
Luo, listen to me.

198
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,660
Mom, school isn't over yet!

199
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,220
Zhou Luo!

200
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,260
If you don't go to Shanghai,

201
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
I'll take my life in front of you!

202
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,300
Get in the car!

203
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,380
Get in! Be a good boy!

204
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,900
What are you up to?

205
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,300
What are you doing? Let me out!

206
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,340
Don't move!

Zhou Luo.

212
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,750
To detect Xu Yi's murder case,

213
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,540
now, we require your cooperation
in our investigation.

214

Come on, get out of the car.

217

What's going on?

218
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,540
What are you doing?

219
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,300
What are you doing?

220
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,380
Guixang, please don't obstruct us
from fulfilling our public duties!

221
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,820
What are you doing?

222
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,860
Cooperate with our investigation.

223
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,820
Don't obstruct us
from fulfilling public duties!

224
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
What's going on?

225

He's just going to assist us
with our investigation.

Come on. Over here.

227
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,740
Zhou Luo is arrested! Look over there!

228
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,660
Look!

229
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,260
Let me in!

230
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,460
Let go!

231
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,660
Don't obstruct us. Let go.

232
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,500
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

233

No!

234
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,360
Get in the car.

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,160

275
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,300

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,140
Open the gate!

What are you trying to do?

279
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,380
Why are you arresting Zhou Luo?

280
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,940
What do you know?

281
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,900
Let's go.

282
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,500

Open the gate!

284
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,260
Can you please let Zhou Luo go?

285
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,980
He didn't do it!

286
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,860
Will this really work?

287
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,820
Now, it'll be

288
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,220
a psychological battle.

289
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,020
No, absolutely not!

290
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,860
This strategy is too risky.

291
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,180
Lin Fanglu,

292
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,180
you've always been prudent.

293
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,660
Don't tell me you were the one
who came up with this strategy.

294
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,060
That's right.

295
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,380
Chen,

296
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,100
stop chewing sunflower seeds.

297
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,340
Do you agree?

298
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,420
Even if I disagree,

299
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,260
there's no other method we can employ.

300
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,140
What do you mean by that?

301
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,980
Trying to psych me into saying yes?

302
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,100
You want me to release
Nan Ya for no reason

303
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,740
while

304
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,260
arresting Zhou Luo

305
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,380
when we don't have any evidence?

306
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,980
You're just playing
on the sidelines of the law.

307
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,220
All of us will be penalized
if something goes wrong, you know?

308
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,100
Comrades,

309
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,260
can we please think twice
before we act upon this plan of yours?

310
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,180
Okay?

311
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,460
So what if we'll be penalized?

312
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,100
It's not like
there's anything else we can do.

313
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,780
Shouldn't we stick together
at moments like this?

314
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,460
We're at a crucial moment for the case.

315
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,060
No one else but the chief

316
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,740
can shoulder the blame right now.

317
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,180
It's not that
I can't shoulder the blame...

318
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,500
Actually, it's not like
we're breaking the rule.

319
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,540
If something does go wrong,

320
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,060
I'll bear all of the responsibilities.

321
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,500
If we release Nan Ya,

322
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,660
she'll be released
on bail pending trial.

323
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
She's been locked up

324
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,580
for some time as well.

325
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,460
Besides, she turned herself in.

326
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,780
It fits all of the criteria.

327
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,340
As for Zhou Luo,

328
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,980
he's suspicious no matter what.

329
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,020
We're not crossing the line
in requesting his cooperation.

330
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,540
You have 24 hours.

331
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,820
We have to break their mental defense

332
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,300
within that period.

333
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,140
If not, it'll be hard

334
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,740
to get something out of them

335
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,780
after releasing them.

336
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,300
Wait. That's not enough time.

337
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,460
That's more than enough.

338
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,500
Zhou Luo.

339
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,980
You see, we cannot arrest you

340
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,140
without any evidence.

341
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,980
You should tell us the truth

342
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,140
as soon as possible.

343
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,660
Don't make your mother worried.

344
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,660
What evidence do you have?

345
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,820
What evidence, huh?

346
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,310
It'll be too late for you

347
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,780
to explain yourself
when we bring it out.

348
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,980
What evidence can you have

349
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,180
of something that never happened?

350
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,500
Are you sure there's nothing

351
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,740
between you and Nan Ya?

352
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,700
She already told us
everything she should.

353
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,740
Now, it's your turn.

354
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,100
She told us of her own accord.

355
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
She showed a good attitude too.

356
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,300
That's why we released her.

357
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,140
I've already told you

358
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,580
what I saw many times.

359
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,980
His mentality is pretty strong.

360
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,340
Even at critical moments,

361
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,780
he knows to stay silent,

362
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,300
control the pace,

363
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,540
and calm himself down.

364
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,300
Ordinary habitual offenders
can never achieve those.

365
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,100
Where did he learn all these from?

366
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,540
Play the recording.

367
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,020
Between my lover and me, 300 long nights

368
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,220
will be erected like 300 high walls.

369
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,580
Do you recognize

370
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,780
this cassette tape?

371
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,980
It must sound familiar to you.

372
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,740
Were you reminded of anything?

373
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,140
I did fancy Nan Ya before.

374
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,940
However, it was a one-sided affair.

375
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,140
She never accepted my feelings.

376
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,500
To her,

377
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,820
I'll always be a kid.

378
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,100
She would have never chosen me
even if she had divorced Xu Yi.

379
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,580
Therefore,

380
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,740
in order to get her,

381
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,860
you were willing to do anything for her.

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,220
I did like Nan Ya.

383
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,220
However, what I said was the truth.

384
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,660
I didn't lie.

385
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,900
Nan Ya killed Xu Yi.

386
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,260
And she did it out of self-defense

387
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,660
under a risky situation

388
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,740
where she had no other choices.

389
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,620
Who said it was self-defense?

390
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,820
Are you the judge here?

391
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,340
Why would we waste our time
interrogating you

392
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,460
if there was nothing suspicious
about the case?

393
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,260
Liu.

394
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,220
Are you having an affair with Zhou Luo?

395
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,860
You're not answering me, huh?

396
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,580
I'll take it as a yes, then.

397
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,540
I'll go and kill Zhou Luo right now!

398
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,420
Xu Yi!

399
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,500
Xu Yi, don't do anything crazy!

400
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,140
Xu Yi!

401
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,580
This is the voice recording
from that night.

402
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,100
Everything you two did

403
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,340
was recorded on this very tape.

404
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,300
I think you didn't expect Nan Ya

405
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,540
to leave this tape

406
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,100
inside the sewing machine, right?

407
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,180
Zhou Luo.

408
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,180
The house is full of your trails.

409
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,660
Do you think it's easy
to forge a crime scene?

410
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,060
Do you think you are more professional
than the police?

411
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,820
Let me show you something else.

412
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,020
Here.

413
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,220
Do you know this?

414
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,860
Think about it.

415
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,620
You touched this axe, right?

416
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,380
I didn't.

417
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,860
You didn't?

418
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,540
Let me explain it to you.

419
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,060
On this axe,

420
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,540
there's nothing else

421
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,500
apart from Xu Yi's fingerprints.

422
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,980
Don't you find it strange?

423
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,620
An axe is a common tool.

424
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,500
Since it's always placed
in the woodshed,

425
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,740
there would be
anyone's fingerprints on it.

426
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,340
Besides,

427
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,580
look at the handle and blade of the axe,

428
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,660
it's probably been used for many years.

429
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,220
However, the surface is clean.

430
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,460
There are no other traces at all.

431
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,660
Unless

432
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,300
someone purposely cleaned it.

433
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,700
Is it possible

434
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,020
that Nan Ya is a clean freak

435
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,420
and she has always wiped these things?

436
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,220
Liu,

437
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,260
assume this is the axe.

438
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,420
What would happen if I chased you around

439
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,780
and slashed at you around the house?

440
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,660
You'd dodge, right?

441
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,060
Naturally, I would slash the wall,

442
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,820
the table,

443
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,260
and many places.

444
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,180
If I used strength,

445
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,260
I could not avoid

446
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,500
moving my hand's position.

447
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,780
How could there be only one trace?

448
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,580
I don't know
the habits of Nan Ya's family.

449
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,860
So I have no idea, either.

450
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,620
Why was your hair

451
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,940
found on Xu Yi's coat, then?

452
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,460
After I came back

453
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,780
from Jinghua's interview,

454
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,780
I took the same bus as Xu Yi.

455
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,260
Anyone else?

456
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,540
We'll be departing soon!

457
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,780
We'll depart now, sir.

458
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,780
We'll depart now.

459
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,330
Perhaps my hair

460
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,060
was left on his coat back then.

461
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,180
You took

462
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,660
the same bus as him?

463
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,860
If we weren't on best terms,

464
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,940
why would we sit in the same row?

465
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,740
You can question my character

466
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,980
but the law always depends on logic, no?

467
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,700
If Nan Ya wanted to kill Xu Yi,

468
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,420
she should drug him first.

469
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,940
Otherwise, she would not be able

470
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,380
to fight against a big man
with her stature and weight.

471
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm sure you know
about Xu Yi abusing Nan Ya.

472
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,540
Even the Women's Federation knew that.

473
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,020
Nan Ya would get a divorce
sooner or later.

474
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,500
What motive did she have

475
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,020
to kill Xu Yi at a time like this?

476
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
It was obviously
justifiable self-defense

477
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,820
yet you are interrogating

478
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,340
the only eyewitness.

479
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,020
Shouldn't the law protect a woman

480
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,740
who suffered from domestic violence?

481
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,420
Zhou Luo.

482
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,700
You treat her so well.

483
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,380
But how has she been treating you?

484
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,820
That's all my wishful thinking.

485
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,420
Do you think it's worth it?

486
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,060
Even if it were someone else,

487
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,380
I would testify for them.

488
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,900
What a silly child.

489
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,340
Do you know Hu Lifan?

490
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,140
Nan Ya's stepbrother.

491
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
Do you know how he died?

492
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,540
Xu Yi killed him

493
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,100
because of Nan Ya.

494
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,700
Both of them hid the body together

495
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,780
inside the lake
where Liu Changshui died.

496
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,500
Did Nan Ya tell you about this?

497
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
You are really willing to do anything

498
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,340
for her, huh?

499
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,060
You can even

500
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,780
give up

501
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,860
your parents and your future?

502
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,700
What about her?

503
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,860
She just turned around and left.

504
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,740
Impossible.

505
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
Impossible.

506
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,340
Zhou Luo.

507
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,620
Do you think I'm lying to you?

508
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,780
I'm not the one who lied to you.

509
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,260
It was Nan Ya who lied to you.

510
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,780
Xu Yi did more than you did back then.

511
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,620
He could do everything

512
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,980
for Nan Ya.

513
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,580
Do you want to end up like him?

514
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,900
Impossible.

515
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,180
A trial like this

516
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,380
makes everyone anxious.

517
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,940
Chen, I've been thinking.

518
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,140
Why didn't we play the recording

519
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,980
to him

520
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,700
and keep pressuring him?

521
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,780
Perhaps he might fess up.

522
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,220
Of course, we can't do that.

523
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,340
What happened on the night of the crime

524
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,180
is all our assumption.

525
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,420
We have no conclusion.

526
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,300
Once there's a mistake in our inference,

527
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,660
Zhou Luo will soon realize

528
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,340
with his wits

529
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,780
that we don't have any exact evidence.

530
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,820
If we still want to

531
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,380
break his mental defense,

532
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,460
it will be even tougher.

533
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,860
Whether or not we can solve this case

534
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,860
depends on the testimony.

535
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,980
Thus,

536
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,780
we first showed

537
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,500
our doubts about their relationship

538
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,660
so he focused

539
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,380
his attention

540
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,460
on justifying their relationship.

541
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,020
Next, we told him

542
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,620
the flaws of the axe
found at the crime scene.

543
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,260
That was our first distraction.

544
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,020
Yes. He was shocked at that point.

545
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,260
However, the flaw
was not enough to break him.

546
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,220
So in the next step,

547
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,340
we fed him the information

548
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,100
of Xu Yi murdering Hu Lifan.

549
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,180
Nan Ya

550
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,980
would never tell Zhou Luo about this.

551
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,060
So he would definitely

552
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,420
be shocked.

553
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,900
Why did we stop at that time?

554
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,100
There's no way this shock will make him

555
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,980
admit to the murder.

556
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,620
His first reaction

557
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,860
is to be on the defense,
so we must wait.

558
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,540
We must give him enough time

559
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,660
so he will become

560
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,000
more and more suspicious.

561
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,860
We've waited for half a day.

562
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,220
What if he is immune
to both soft and hard tactics?

563
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,620
Enough.

564
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,100
That's enough for today.

565
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,660
Go back to rest.

566
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,780
Are we not
interrogating him anymore, sir?

567
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,420
If he doesn't confess today,

568
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,060
we'll be under big pressure tomorrow.

569
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,220
This is a psychological battle.

570
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,300
It's like playing chess blindfolded
in the dark.

571
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,820
We need to predict our situation
with every step we take.

572
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,660
Whoever loses his composure first

573
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,180
will suffer a huge defeat.

574
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,660
Right now,

575
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,700
we've let Zhou Luo

576
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,820
listen to the recording.

577
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,540
Zhou Luo has obtained
four pieces of information now.

578
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,140
One.

579
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,660
We now know
his relationship with Nan Ya.

580
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Two.

581
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
The flaw on the axe
found at the crime scene.

582
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,140
Three.

583
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,620
Nan Ya might have
taken advantage of his feelings.

584
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
Four.

585
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,220
The recording of the scene

586
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,300
might expose everything.

587
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,380
Think about it.

588
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
What is Zhou Luo's greatest weakness?

589
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,140
Study.

590
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,100
His future.

591
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,780
Wrong.

592
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,940
He has absolute confidence
in his ability.

593
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
He defended his decision

594
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,380
and dropped out
of university regardless.

595
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,330
He then received
his grade reduction notice

596
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,300
for admission to Jinghua.

597
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,740
Hasn't he always been calm?

598
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,180
It's his feeling towards Nan Ya, then.

599
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,500
The seeds of doubt were planted.

600
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,340
Whether or not it can affect him

601
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,140
depends on

602
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
the relationship

603
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,660
between the two of them.

604
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
The thing is, the evidence at the scene

605
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,260
can't directly prove
that Zhou Luo is the murderer.

606
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,060
We can't detain him

607
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,460
for more than 24 hours.

608
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,660
If he still doesn't fess up tomorrow,

609
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,540
the chief will be mad.

610
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,740
Do you think

611
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,900
letting Nan Ya go in front of him

612
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,180
will affect him in any way?

613
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,660
It's not that effective.

614
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,180
Are you kidding me?

615
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,980
What are you trying to do?

616
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,460
Are you letting the whole police force

617
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,620
shoulder this blame?

618
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,580
What do you think

619
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,820
is Zhou Luo's greatest weakness?

620
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,460
Stop acting mysterious, all right?

621
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,820
Isn't it obvious?

622
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,380
What?

623
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,460
Guixiang.

624
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,940
As expected from an experienced police.

625
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,500
He's being confined.

626
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
It's better to let his mother

627
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,940
cry in front of him.

628
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,580
I wasn't letting Nan Ya go
in front of Zhou Luo.

629
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,060
I was arresting Zhou Luo
in front of Nan Ya.

630
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,300
The one being detained
isn't the key person.

631
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,700
The one we want to deal with
is the one we released.

632
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,060
Zhou Luo's weakness

633
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,340
is Nan Ya's as well.

634
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,820
Scram!

635
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,540
Guixiang.

636
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,420
How dare you come here again!

637
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:41,860
Guixiang.

638
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,780
Do you even have a conscience?

639
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,740
I treated you so well.

640
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,660
But look what you did to me.

641
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,460
You are not human! You are a demon!

642
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,540
You are a demon!

643
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,220
Demon!

644
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,060
I'm going to kill you now!

645
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,620
Don't hit my mother!

646
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,700
Madam Guixiang, don't hit my mother!

647
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,260
Guixiang.

648
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
Guixiang, please let me
bring my daughter home.

649
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,460
I hate you!

650
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,780
Let me bring my daughter home.

651
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,260
I hate you!

652
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,380
I'm going to kill you!

653
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,900
Come out, Nan Ya!

654
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,740
Come out!

655
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,300
Nan Ya!

656
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,540
Pay with your life!

657
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,700
Come out!

658
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,100
Nan Ya, come out!

659
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,340
You can't hide forever! I dare you

660
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,260
to hide inside forever!

661
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,340
Come out!

662
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,980
What are you doing? Stop shouting!

663
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,020
What are you doing?

664
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,580
What are you doing?

665
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,740
What are you doing?

666
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,100
Don't move!

667
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,900
Hurry!

668
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,380
Stand still!

669
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,180
Back off!

670
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,220
That's right. Walk while singing.

671
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,220
When he reaches the snowing hill...

672
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,220
Also, in order
to avoid arousing suspicions,

673
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,340
he has applied

674
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,660
to not take charge of this case anymore.

675
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,700
That still won't do!

676
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,580
Do you think
the Xu family is a pushover?

677
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,340
I'm telling you! I want to see

678
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,020
who dares to call it
justifiable self-defense.

679
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,940
I'm warning you.

680
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,740
Provoking trouble and hurting others

681
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,940
are against the law.

682
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,980
Whatever!

683
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,580
Dad!

684
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,460
Why are you here?

685
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,340
I'll say this.

686
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,380
My son is dead.

687
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,540
If Nan Ya is not sentenced,

688
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,460
I will kill her to avenge my son!

689
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,100
The judge decides
whether she will be sentenced or not.

690
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,940
If you are not convinced,
you can make an appeal.

691
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,980
Of course not!

692
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,360
She killed my son with two stabs.

693
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,540
And she just left him to die
without calling an ambulance.

694
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,940
It's not long since his passing.

695
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,020
Right now, you released the murderer

696
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,540
because of so-called
"justifiable self-defense".

697
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,220
Ask everyone out there!

698
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,540
Who will agree to it?

699
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,860
Is there any justice left?

700
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,180
Exactly!

701
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,020
Quiet!

702
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,620
Stand still!

703
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,980
Don't move!

704
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,700
Sir.

705
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,500
Let me ask you.

706
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,980
When your son

707
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,060
beat her badly,

708
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,900
why didn't you ask
whether or not there was justice?

709
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,540
When your son cut corners
in the bridge case

710
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,620
and caused two people dead,

711
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,020
why didn't you ask if there was justice?

712
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,940
If he were still alive,

713
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,260
he would be imprisoned.

714
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,380
Right now, he has been murdered.

715
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,500
That person must be sentenced!

716
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,900
We can only decide

717
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,220
after looking
into the situation of the crime!

718
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,580
It hasn't been decided.

719
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,020
Why are you making a fuss here?

720
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,460
It's still under investigation, no?

721
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,180
Why has Nan Ya been released, then?

722
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,540
Why?

723
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,460
Do we need to ask for your approval

724
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,700
in our investigation procedures?

725
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,100
I... You...

726
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,860
What?

727
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,900
Are you trying to go against the police?

728
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,900
You are anxious.

729
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,740
What's more interesting

730
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,420
is that it's ice-cold in Antarctica.

731
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,420
The Antarctica research team members...

732
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,420
Who is it?

733
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,420
It's me.

734
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,740
Lin Fanglu.

735
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,860
I bought you rice,

736
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,580
vegetables, and meat.

737
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,060
It's enough for a few days.

738
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,980
Xu Yi's family is making a scene.

739
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,140
You shouldn't leave the house recently.

740
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,060
Just stay at home.

741
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,020
I'll go now.

742
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,580
Remember to lock the door.

743
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,260
Nan Ya.

744
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
If you need any help,

745
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,420
you can call the police.

746
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,000
♪I rushed into the forest♪

747
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,580
♪The forest is bushy♪

748
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,540
♪I can't find his whereabouts♪

749
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,580
