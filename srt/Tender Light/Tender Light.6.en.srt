[Episode 06]

2
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,060
A road less traveled

3
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
suggests loneliness

4
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,900
and endlessness.

5
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,300
But when a person's soul
is rich enough,

6
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,540
they won't be afraid of the loneliness.

7
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,540
On the contrary,

8
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,900
they'd become
closer friends with themselves.

9
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,340
In this world,

10
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,500
only useless things
can be called beautiful.

11
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,780
The beauty of art

12
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,500
can keep people in despair

13
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,460
from giving up
on their passion for life.

14
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,620
If I were to go to university one day,

15
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,620
I'd like to choose Literature
as my major.

16
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,260
Even if

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,260
it's hard

18
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,140
and won't make me get rich.

19
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,060
Nan Ya!

20
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,380
- Ma'am.
- Please don't hit her, ma'am.

21
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,540
Go away!

22
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Go, hurry up.

23
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,780
Your poor father didn't leave us
any money.

24
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,940
There's no money
for you to go to school.

[Inpatient Department]

26
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,980
Chen Ling.

27
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,700
Chen Ling,

28
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,660
there is no record

29
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,380
of Nan Ya
in the Outpatient Department at all.

30
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,240
Her medical record in the department

31
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,300
of Gynaecology and Obstetrics
is also missing.

32
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,020
That is not under my purview.

33
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,660
If it's our department's business,
you can ask the chief.

34
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,500
The treatment records
are supposed to be copies.

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,180
It's normal if they're missing
after a long time.

36
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,020
But other patients' are all there.

37
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,860
Only Nan Ya's records
of her being beaten

38
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,900
are missing.

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,260
Don't you find it odd?

40
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,340
So what?

41
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,700
I suspect someone
deliberately got rid of it.

42
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,460
Are you suspecting me?

43
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,100
Why would you think that?

44
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,660
Otherwise, why are you asking me these?

45
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,140
Xu Yi hid the proof of his abuse

46
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,380
so that he could keep Nan Ya
under control.

47
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,260
Please think carefully.

48
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,180
Is there any proof

49
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,660
showing that Nan Ya
had sought treatment here?

50
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,340
For instance, IV drip, dressing wounds,

51
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,900
or perhaps a nurse
from your department...

52
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
Officer Lin.

53
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,980
It's not my job
to help you solve the case.

54
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,220
I thought you'd be more capable

55
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,100
since you came
from the provincial capital.

56
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,020
But you're just like the men
in this town.

57
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,460
You go weak at the knees
in front of Nan Ya.

58
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,700
What is so charming about her?

59
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
Why are you all helping her?

60
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,260
You even came all the way
to find proof for her

61
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,460
to free her.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,100
It's been so many years.

63
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,260
When Nan Ya got beaten,
I was involved.

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,780
Now Xu Yi is dead, I'm again involved.

65
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,900
And others have even been talking
behind my back.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,220
I've had enough!

[Tender Light]

68
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,940
You must have heard

69
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
about the things among the three of us.

70
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,140
Although she was beaten,

71
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,860
but you don't need
to sympathize with her.

72
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,380
It's her own fault.

73
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,340
She deserved it.

74
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,820
None of them are good people.

75
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,100
Whether she's good or bad

76
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,900
has nothing to do
with whether she's guilty or not.

77
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,660
Don't be fooled by her delicate look.

78
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,020
In order to get what she wants,

79
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,220
she would do anything.

80
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,100
Do you think

81
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,420
she murdered him?

82
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,940
Definitely.

83
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,820
Why are you so sure?

84
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,020
I know her very well.

85
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,900
You hate her.

86
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,460
I can differentiate between hatred
and other things.

87
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,140
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

88
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,820
I was the one in this world

89
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,260
who treated her the best.

90
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,660
We were middle school classmates.

91
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,260
Her mom died early on.

92
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,620
The dad was an alcoholic.

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,860
Her stepmom was mean to her,

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,300
and she brought along
a scoundrel son.

95
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,860
She was always bullied at home.

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,780
At school, she was isolated.

97
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,620
No one cared about her.

98
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,860
Why are you still here?

99
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm doing my homework.

100
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,740
The lights in the building
are turned off.

101
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
Aren't you scared?

102
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,580
No.

103
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,300
Can't believe I left this behind.

104
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,700
That's why I had to come back.

105
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,300
Have you finished the math homework?

106
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,100
Then,

107
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,380
could you let me take a look?

108
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,780
I don't know how to solve it.

109
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,060
Can you explain it to me?

110
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Which question?

111
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,140
I'll teach you.

112
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,380
Well,

113
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,300
it's too cold here.

114
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,460
Let's go to my place,
and then you can explain it to me.

115
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,100
Come on.

116
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,060
See?

117
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,900
We know that the function f(x)
equals X plus two.

118
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,100
The denominator is zero plus two,
which equals two.

119
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,860
And then,

120
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,340
when X minus one...

121
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,100
I really don't get it.

122
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,340
This question...

123
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,620
You'll get it soon enough.

124
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,740
I'll explain it to you.

125
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,820
It's easy.

126
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,420
We just need to substitute this value.

127
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,100
The absolute value of zero plus two
over zero minus one...

128
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,460
Are you hungry?

129
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,340
It equals to...

130
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,820
Look here.

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,060
I get hungry whenever I do math.

132
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,820
Let's forget it.

133
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,500
Come on.

134
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Follow me.

135
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
I'll make you

136
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,460
the best food
in Qingshui Town.

137
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,220
I want to eat too.

138
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,620
Eating so late

139
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,700
will give you bad teeth.

140
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
If you don't let me eat,

141
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,700
I'll tell Mom

142
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,420
that you...

143
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,620
Okay, here.

144
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,340
You can take all of these.

145
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,100
You made great contributions.

146
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,420
I won't treat you unfairly.

147
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
I'll put this on you.

148
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,220
No!

149
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,580
Let me put it on.

150
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,980
Come on.

151
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,580
Missy.

152
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,340
Come and drink with us.
We'll buy you drinks.

153
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,100
We're bored drinking by ourselves.

154
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,500
That's right.

155
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,700
Come here, drink with us.

156
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,060
Let's go.

157
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,980
Do I still look pretty to you?

158
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,700
That's how she is.

159
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,580
She won't sit back
and take the bullying.

160
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,980
So do you think she would
let herself be the victim?

161
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,580
At the time,

162
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,700
she was determined
to leave Qingshui Town.

163
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,620
She'd go to university and never return.

164
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,340
In fact, I couldn't bear to see her go.

165
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,420
So I spent each day with her

166
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
like it was the last.

167
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,500
Nan Ya is someone

168
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,500
with a lot of secrets.

169
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,700
Sometimes,

170
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,180
I find myself not understanding her too.

171
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,780
After she got
into the Qingshui No. 1 High School,

172
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,340
I went to a nursing school
because of my bad results.

173
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,180
Her stepbrother,

174
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,340
Hu Lifan, often caused trouble for her.

175
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,940
But she never spoke of the things

176
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,260
that happened at home.

177
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,140
At the time,

178
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
she liked a boy in her class,

179
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,380
who did well in his studies.

180
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,940
But later, when she started working
at a factory,

181
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,780
they seemed to have split up.

182
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,820
Why did she start working?

183
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,500
Her dad died.

184
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,780
There's no way Hu Xiu would pay
for her studies.

185
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,260
By earning her own money,

186
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,820
Hu Xiu would not take care
of her anymore.

187
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,860
Plus, once she was gone,

188
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,340
the house would be owned by Hu Xiu.

189
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,860
But there's one thing

190
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,140
I've found weird all this time.

191
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,700
What is it?

192
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,420
Nan Ya's dad

193
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,580
froze to death at the gate.

194
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,140
During that time,

195
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,340
she stopped coming to sleep over
at my house.

196
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,500
I went to look for her,

197
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,580
but she wouldn't see me.

198
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,540
Every night, Nan Ya would open the door
for her dad.

199
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,100
But she didn't do it that night.

200
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,380
She later said she was sick.

201
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,580
Hu Xiu had bought her cold medication,

202
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,660
so she slept deeply.

203
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,940
Later, people started saying

204
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,700
that Hu Xiu deliberately
left her dad outside.

205
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,380
The way Nan Zhong died is too weird.

206
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,220
How did he manage to freeze
to death in front of his house?

207
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,220
He was already at the door.

208
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,380
He could've just knocked, no?

209
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,860
Maybe he fell asleep
after knocking a few times.

210
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,780
It was cold and snowing at night.

211
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,020
He was already buried by morning.

212
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,700
Why did you purposely kill your father?

213
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,420
Speak up!

214
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,260
Explain yourself!

215
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,580
You deliberately left him...

216
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,380
Left your father to freeze outside!

217
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,380
Hu Xiu, stop it.

218
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,620
You've gone too far!

219
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,060
Nan Ya is so poor.

220
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,860
She purposely killed her dad.

221
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,020
There's no way Nan Ya would do that.

222
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,420
You're being overly cruel to her.

223
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,060
No matter what,

224
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,900
Nan Ya is Nan Zhong's daughter,
after all.

225
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,820
It couldn't be her.

226
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,820
What are you doing here?

227
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,020
I met your dad just a few months ago.

228
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,980
Who would've thought...

229
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,820
It's okay.

230
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,620
Every person has their own destiny.

231
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,540
Death isn't necessarily a bad thing.

232
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,820
I'm actually quite happy

233
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,500
to see you at this moment.

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,620
Actually,

235
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,100
I've been wanting to tell you,

236
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,940
that day...

237
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,060
What class do we have this afternoon?

238
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,100
Geometry.

239
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
And History.

240
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,900
Are you going?

241
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,180
Why not?

242
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,540
During that period,

243
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,100
was there anything odd with Nan Ya?

244
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,060
She had fallen out with Hu Xiu

245
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,500
before she left to work at the factory.

246
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,140
I offered to let her stay with us.

247
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,020
Why did you cut it up?

248
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,060
You were knitting day and night,

249
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,260
and it was almost done.

250
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,940
I made two stitches.

251
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,260
So what then?

252
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,860
I took a look yesterday,

253
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,140
and it looked beautiful.

254
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,460
Even if there were wrong stitches,
I couldn't tell.

255
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,500
Other people might not notice,

256
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,100
but I know.

257
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,660
I can't get past it.

258
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,700
During that time,

259
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,260
she was always down and glum.

260
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,420
When I asked, she said nothing.

261
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,100
Nan Ya is actually

262
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,820
quite eager to excel.

263
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,700
Whatever she does,

264
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,580
she wants to do better than others.

265
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,940
So working at the factory

266
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,460
almost killed her.

267
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,460
Where are you off to, Ling?

268
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,260
Nan Ya went swimming
but hasn't come back.

269
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,180
I'm going to see what's going on.

270
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,220
Okay.

271
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,340
Hang on.

272
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,500
Here.

273
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,020
There are two,

274
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,100
one for each of you.

275
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,740
I'm off.

276
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,820
Okay.

277
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,060
When you find Nan Ya,

278
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,860
you guys just go back and eat.

279
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,020
Nan Ya, what's the matter?

280
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,340
Where did you go?

281
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,420
You were gone so long.

282
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,180
What's this?

283
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,700
Bedsheets and quilt covers.

284
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,940
And some daily necessities.

285
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,660
Why did you buy these?

286
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,420
I'm going to start working
at the factory.

287
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,380
I thought you didn't want to go.

288
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,940
I've discussed it with my parents.

289
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,460
There's less than a year
till the college entrance exam.

290
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,180
If Hu Xiu doesn't pay your tuition,

291
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,460
we'll settle it for you.

292
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,180
But if I were admitted to university,

293
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,540
who would afford my school fees?

294
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,500
After that,

295
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,060
she moved out of my house
and went to the factory.

296
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,660
She spent all the festivals there.

297
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,020
She almost severed all ties with Hu Xiu.

298
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,940
After she started working
at the factory,

299
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
she lived on a tight budget

300
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,780
in order to earn her school fees.

301
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,460
To save money,

302
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,580
she ate plain noodles as a full meal.

303
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,980
Nan Ya!

304
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,780
To make more money,

305
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,500
she worked day and night.

306
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,660
[Finance Office]
When other people were on leave,

307
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,020
she volunteered to do extra shifts.

308
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,220
At the same time,
she didn't give up studying.

309
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,660
She lost so much weight.

310
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,180
Mrs. Chen.

311
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,100
Nan Ya, come in.

312
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,780
Come inside.

313
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,900
Ling, look who's here!

314
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,820
Did you miss me?

315
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,460
Of course.

316
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,260
Why did you buy so much stuff?

317
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,100
Every time she got paid,

318
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,020
she'd visit me with bags full of gifts.

319
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,100
I even blamed her

320
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
for spending money on those things.

321
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,700
She should be spoiling herself more.

322
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,300
I really treated her as my good friend.

323
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,380
Nan Ya.

324
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,820
You're late.

325
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,700
This is the guy I told you about.

326
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,780
Xu Yi.

327
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,220
Hello.

328
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,420
Chen Ling often mentions you.

329
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,660
Sorry, I'm not going
to shake your hand today.

330
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,460
I am here to assess you.

331
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,900
Sit.

332
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,820
The first time they met,

333
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,060
Nan Ya wasn't nice to him.

334
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,980
I thought she was sticking up for me

335
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,060
as a good friend

336
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,540
and was deliberately being mean to him.

337
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,020
When we were dating,
I would also ask her to come along.

338
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,540
To give her a breather, you know?

339
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,620
After a few times,

340
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,140
Nan Ya still didn't think
too highly of him.

341
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,420
What do you think of him?

342
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,660
Who?

343
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,180
Xu Yi.

344
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,060
It's fine so long as you like him.

345
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,740
You know what?

346
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,340
When my mom told me

347
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,300
someone wanted to set me up,

348
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,940
I was pretty conflicted.

349
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,700
I went without dressing up.

350
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,860
When I got there,

351
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,300
he was standing by the river

352
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,740
and propping next to his car.

353
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,620
I liked him

354
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,740
the moment I saw him.

355
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,140
He is different from other men.

356
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,820
Sure.

357
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,180
He's rich.

358
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,700
What are you talking about?

359
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,180
Am I that kind of girl?

360
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,300
He isn't tacky at all.

361
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,020
We didn't go to a restaurant

362
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,180
or the cinema.

363
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,380
As soon as

364
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,780
I got in the car,
he handed me a bottle of soda.

365
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
He asked if I'd like to go
to the amusement park.

366
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,220
It was already the afternoon.

367
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,300
Driving to the amusement park
would take at least two hours.

368
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,260
But I thought, so what?

369
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,060
Bring it on.

370
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,940
We had a nice chat on the road too.

371
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,820
He's well-educated.

372
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,580
And he's very capable.

373
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,500
He did some business in Guangzhou

374
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,100
and made a lot of money.

375
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,300
Anyone with that kind
of family background

376
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,660
would be able to do those things.

377
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,940
That's not for sure.

378
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,140
None of his cousins
are as successful as him.

379
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,620
Just tell me.

380
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,980
I really want
to hear your thoughts on him.

381
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,100
Good family background.

382
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,780
Tall.

383
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,580
And rich.

384
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,020
I was pretty annoyed at the time.

385
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,940
I thought she was too judgmental.

386
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,060
But in fact, it was because
she was herself interested in him.

387
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,580
Did she say why she thought
Xu Yi was a bad man?

388
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,860
No.

389
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,740
She was being
particularly obscure about it.

390
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,260
Guess it was her plan.

391
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,700
Xu Yi had a good family.

392
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,380
She kept saying those things.

393
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,220
So I started doubting too,

394
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,420
believing perhaps
there was something wrong with Xu Yi.

395
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,620
When did they start getting close?

396
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,420
I guess I was stupid.

397
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,220
They were probably flirting
with each other during our dates.

398
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,700
But I found out about it
purely by chance.

399
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,020
Someone at the factory
didn't like Nan Ya.

400
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,100
They called me in the middle
of the night and told me

401
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,300
that Xu Yi was living in Nan Ya's dorm.

402
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,020
I didn't believe it then.

403
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,820
But I tossed and turned the whole night.

404
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,060
And the next morning

405
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,700
I went knocking on Nan Ya's dorm room.

406
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,420
But then, Xu Yi was the one
who opened the door.

407
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,900
There she was, shedding crocodile tears.

408
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,500
She said she didn't think

409
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,100
things would become like this.

410
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,940
Then?

411
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,420
Then, they got married.

412
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,020
She didn't even bother to say sorry
or explain to me.

413
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,980
And she never came to my house again.

414
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,780
I heard you were admitted

415
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,700
to University
of Political Science and Law.

416
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,740
That's good.

417
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,980
It's one
of the national key universities.

418
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,260
Take this.

419
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,660
When I settle down at the school,

420
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,580
I'll write to you.

421
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,700
You can get letters
by the address of the factory, right?

422
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,420
Don't lose hope.

423
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,740
I can't stay long.

424
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,700
I have to go back.

425
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,500
Take care of yourself!

426
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Nan Ya.

427
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,100
Leave this place.

428
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,980
Leave Qingshui Town!

429
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,060
Wanwan is doing well at Guixiang's.

430
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,180
She misses her mom sometimes,

431
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,340
but

432
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,780
she goes for her
regular hospital checkups on time.

433
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,820
Her health condition, appetite,

434
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,740
and sleep condition are all good.

435
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,820
Thank you.

436
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,260
Go ahead and ask me whatever you want.

437
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,420
I won't talk about the case today.

438
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,540
Think of it as...

439
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,660
As two old friends having a chat.

440
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,580
There is one thing

441
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,620
I've been puzzled with.

442
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,220
What is it?

443
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,620
What do you really think of Xu Yi?

444
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Xu Yi

445
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,820
was selfish,

446
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,540
irritable

447
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,060
and paranoid.

448
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,780
He was over-possessive.

449
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,220
Deep down, he was weak.

450
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,180
And he had no bottom line.

451
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,260
Then, why did you marry him?

452
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
Xu Yi came from a good family.

453
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,900
He was handsome.

454
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,020
He run his own business
and made lots of money.

455
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,700
With such an amazing offer,

456
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,380
why would I refuse him?

457
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,620
What about him
being your best friend's boyfriend?

458
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,180
Are you someone who would do
whatever it takes

459
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,220
and ignore your best friend's feelings

460
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,860
just to get your hands on a good catch?

461
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,940
I am.

462
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,500
The facts are right there.

463
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,500
Seeking advantages and avoiding loss
are human instincts.

464
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,940
Wouldn't you have chosen the same?

465
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,220
Is a woman like me

466
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,580
deserving to be abused by the husband

467
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,500
and cannot lift a finger in defense?

468
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,020
What are you doing here?

469
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,260
I'm listening to the songs

470
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,780
by the foreign rock band
you gave me previously.

471
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,660
I thought you had thrown it away.

472
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,380
There's no need
to vent my anger on a tape.

473
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,700
And the flowers I gave you?

474
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,260
I've planted them in the yard.

475
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,140
Next time, don't send any more things

476
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,180
to my shop.

477
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,300
Why are you always setting rules for me?

478
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,940
But I'm terrible
at following rules.

479
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,060
Aren't you known as a good student?

480
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,060
I'm also known
for being expelled from school.

481
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,420
Haven't you heard those rumors?

482
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
It doesn't matter

483
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,020
how people think.

484
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,460
What matters most is
what your real thoughts are.

485
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,780
Maybe neither of us belongs here.

486
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
When I was young,
I wanted to run away so badly.

487
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,540
I thought there was a whole
different world outside of this place.

488
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,820
Why didn't you leave here then?

489
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,340
Maybe it was my fate.

490
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,620
But I don't think you're someone
who'd simply accept fate.

491
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,660
Times have passed
and circumstances have changed.

492
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,380
I don't think it's too late.

493
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,660
My mother was an educated youth.

494
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,540
She was born
in a family of intellectuals.

495
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,180
So when I was young,

496
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,500
she would copy piano scores
onto the cardboard

497
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,580
and teach me to read them.

498
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,540
She encouraged me
to read novels and poems.

499
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,940
And she'd decorate my room
with wildflowers.

500
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,260
There would always be things like apples

501
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,060
and orange peels in her cupboard.

502
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,340
You'd get a whiff of a wonderful scent
when you opened it.

503
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,860
But what about it?

504
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,060
She ended up
marrying a brute like my father

505
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,060
and lived a miserable life.

506
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
She passed away

507
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,180
when she was still young.

508
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,460
That's the way the world is.

509
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,740
You like poems, right?

510
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,100
I have one for you.

511
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,380
We live under a dark sky.

512
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,100
And there's hardly

513
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,340
any humans here.

514
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,540
Perhaps that's the reason

515
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,460
why there are so few poems.

516
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,780
I prefer another poem.

517
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,580
Before the summer fades away,

518
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,820
let's tend to the garden once again,

519
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
watering the flowers and trees.

520
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,100
They're weary,

521
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,540
about to wither,

522
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,260
perhaps as soon as tomorrow.

523
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,740
And the whole world

524
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,700
goes crazy once more.

525
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,180
Before succumbing
to the sound of gunfire,

526
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,900
let you and I

527
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,500
rejoice again

528
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,060
for those beautiful things

529
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,780
and sing joyfully for them.

530
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,860
[Your kindness to me]
♪Heal the world♪

531
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,260
[is in a way]
♪Make it a better place♪

532
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,290
[a very cruel thing.]

533
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:17,120
[We are in the same desert,]

534
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,870
[and we're searching for perhaps
the same spring.]

535
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,460
[And yet,
we are invisible to each other.]

536
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:35,830
[We are always alone.]

537
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Can I go and look for you
at your shop in the future?

538
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,460
It's not very convenient.

539
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,700
Then how can I talk
to you in the future?

540
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,580
You can talk when you see me.

541
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
I went to restock a few days ago

542
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,220
and saw this nice sweater.

543
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,740
I hope you'll accept it as an apology.

544
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,220
Did you sew this yourself?

545
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,700
I told you I bought it.

546
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,140
I never saw any shop selling
such a nice sweater.

547
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm glad you like it.

548
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,060
Guixiang.

549
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,020
He's done packing.

550
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,980
Your dad has processed your discharge.

551
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,700
Thank you for taking care
of him these days.

552
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,700
As for the grievances between us,

553
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,260
let's just forget it.

554
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,660
The car's here. Let's go.

555
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,420
It's here?

556
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,180
That's good.

557
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,580
Luo, just take your own bag.

558
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,060
Come on, Luo.

559
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,820
Xu Yi is out?

560
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,140
I saw it myself.

561
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,340
He went into Nan Ya's shop,

562
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,980
and not long after,

563
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,020
the two went home, hand in hand.

564
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,980
Those two are just weirdos.

565
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,140
Nan Ya got him incarcerated

566
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,300
for over 20 days.

567
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,460
The moment he's out,

568
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,820
he went begging for forgiveness

569
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,540
with gifts.

570
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,340
If I had such a beautiful wife,

571
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,260
I'd do this too.

572
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,300
You wish.

573
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,180
You're just good for nothing.

574
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,620
Boss,

575
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,700
we'd like a game.

576
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,500
Coming.

577
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,540
Watch me.

578
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,460
Zhou Luo is here.

579
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,740
Hit this one.

580
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
You got beat up

581
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,940
for nothing, kid.

582
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,660
That couple

583
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,380
is acting like newlyweds again.

584
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,980
Why throw the ball

585
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,300
if you don't want to play?

586
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,660
Zhou Luo!

587
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,020
He feels ashamed.

588
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,660
He tried to act like the hero
at such a young age.

589
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,100
What are you saying?

590
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,700
Come at me if you dare!

591
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,900
Want to fight, huh?

592
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,820
What are you doing?

593
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,700
Stop it!

594
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,870
[Science Class (1)]

595
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,620
Zhou Luo, I haven't seen you in a while.

596
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,740
This is the only quiet place.

597
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
Are you here to study?

598
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,980
To return books.

599
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
If there are some books you wish to read,

600
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,380
just let me know.

601
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:55,980
Okay.

602
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,740
Okay, pick more.

603
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:57,780
Thanks.

604
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,820
Zhou Luo!

605
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,740
No talking.

606
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,220
This is the library.

607
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,100
Write.

608
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,540
Zhou Luo,

609
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,860
look what I've drawn.

610
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,420
Wanwan,

611
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,580
I said no talking here, okay?

612
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,060
Draw it by yourself.

[Guangdong Province]

614
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,180
Why did you forgive him?

615
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,620
This has nothing to do with you,
Zhou Luo.

616
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,020
How does it not?

617
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,820
So I was beaten up for nothing?

618
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,540
Didn't we agree...

619
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,060
Didn't we agree to be friends?

620
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,380
So why can't I care about you?

621
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,100
Even a friend needs to respect
other people's privacy.

622
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,020
If you go on like this,
it's just never going to...

623
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,380
This is the library.

624
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,060
If you need anything,

625
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,820
I can help you.

626
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,740
I don't need it.

627
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,460
I just can't leave him.

628
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,500
I don't believe you.

629
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,260
You can believe it or not.

630
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,140
Nan Ya...

631
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,980
What are you doing?

632
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,540
I'm going to kill you.

633
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,460
You'll pay for killing me.

634
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,980
What about Wanwan?

635
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,620
You refuse to divorce me anyway.

636
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,860
I will still die

637
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,340
Since I can't have my daughter,

638
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,220
I might as well kill you.

639
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,980
I won't divorce you

640
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,060
because I love you.

641
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,100
Nan Ya,

642
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,660
why can't we just live together
and be happy?

643
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,820
Xu Yi,

644
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,740
did you really think I didn't know

645
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,060
that you were the one

646
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,540
who spread those rumors in town?

647
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,820
You pretend to be a gentleman out there,

648
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,940
tolerant and generous.

649
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,500
You paint me as a dirty slut.

650
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,820
What good is that to you?

651
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,860
You think you can control me like this?

652
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,740
Not only are you useless,

653
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,060
but you're also shameless.

654
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,660
Now, between us,

655
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,740
it's no longer a matter
of getting a divorce.

656
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,540
It's a matter of who dies and who lives.

657
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,700
Nan Ya, don't do anything stupid.

658
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,540
Yes, I admit
that there's something wrong with me.

659
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,020
But it's because I love you.

660
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,100
Give me another chance, okay?

661
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,540
Sure.

662
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,580
Then, move out.

663
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,020
Nan Ya, listen.

664
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,700
Shut up.

665
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,740
If you don't move out,

666
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,740
this scene may replay itself

667
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,340
every night from now on.

668
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,500
Fine.

669
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,820
Okay.

670
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,620
We'll live separately.

671
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,060
But I don't want a divorce.
