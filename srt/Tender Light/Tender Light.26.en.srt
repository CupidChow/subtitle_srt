00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,860
[Episode 26]

2
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,300
Show him your ticket.

3
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,460
Luo,

4
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,340
listen.

5
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,500
About the instant noodles inside,

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,940
don't cook them
as soon as you get on the train.

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,700
Got it.

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,660
See if you like any
of the boxed lunches.

9
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,900
If you do, go and get one.

10
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,860
Don't worry about the money.

11
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,100
Over there.

12
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Also,

13
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,980
there are some sausages,

14
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,140
spiced corned eggs, and roasted chicken.

15
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,100
These are all your favorites.

16
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,860
Remember to eat them.

17
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,740
Got it, Mom.

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,100
Don't be nervous.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,260
Just do your best.

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,540
Luo won't get nervous.

21
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,860
I'm not nervous at all, Dad.

22
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,940
I'll take the bag.

23
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,420
Zhou Luo,

24
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,460
this is a protective charm
we got for you

25
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,260
from the Guanyin Temple.

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
It's said it will bless you
for a successful exam.

27
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,420
You believe in this?

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,780
When you come back
after passing the exam,

29
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,860
you'll probably

30
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,340
be even more arrogant.

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,300
Good luck, bro.

32
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,740
Then I'll keep this close to my heart.

33
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,940
It's coming.

34
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,940
Put the bag on the rack.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,420
Take care.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,420
Remember to tell us
when you arrive.

37
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,540
Yes, remember to tell us
when you arrive.

38
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,420
Just do your best!

39
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,300
You can do it.

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,260
Take care.

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,420
Zhou Luo, we'll wait for your return.

42
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,540
Do your best in the exam, you hear me?

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,020
Go for it!

44
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,020
Are you not going to see me off?

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,740
No,

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,100
I'm not going.

47
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,340
Just hide in the corner of the station

48
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,700
and give me a glance from afar.

49
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,220
Well, no.

50
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
Then I'll take some photos for you
when I arrive in Beijing.

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,580
Focus on your exam.
That's what matters.

52
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:18,320
[Tender Light]

53
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
Nan Ya,

54
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,140
the school in Beijing is excellent,

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,980
and I did pretty well in the exam.

56
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,420
How about you?

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,780
Every time when I leave Qingshui Town,

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,060
I can feel the vastness
and freedom of the world.

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,540
Yeah, I've got everything.

60
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,220
Everyone is striving
for their dreams here.

61
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,540
You will definitely love it here.

62
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,580
Music,

63
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,940
literature,

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,260
and poetry.

65
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,780
Everything beautiful that you pursue

66
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,700
is possible to become real here.

67
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,900
Believe in yourself.

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,980
Leaving Qingshui Town

69
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,820
will allow you to enter
a whole new world.

70
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,140
Look,

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,300
this is the second case,

72
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,140
very similar.

73
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,860
You take a look first.

74
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
There's also another one...

75
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:24,270
[Plaintiff]

76
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,500
Why hasn't Xu Yi arrived yet?

77
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,820
What if he doesn't come today?

78
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,980
It's okay.

79
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,180
Even if he's absent,

80
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,140
we can still proceed with the judgment.

81
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,140
The evidence of his domestic violence
is very compelling now.

82
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,660
In a sense, you could say

83
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,700
that you're already divorced.

84
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
But in terms of the custody battle,

85
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,940
your only disadvantage

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
is that your income is unstable

87
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,740
while your daughter is ill.

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,700
[Defendant]

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
Tonight, let's go

90
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,900
to the student union's
millennium party.

91
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,580
I've heard they're also going
to set off fireworks.

92
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,300
Sure.

93
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,070
Have you decided what wishes

94
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,340
you want to make
on Millennium Night?

95
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm not telling you.

96
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,420
I got accepted with a lower score.

97
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,260
I knew you could.

98
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,060
Oh,

99
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
I bought the train ticket for today.

100
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,500
Wait for me to come back.

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,340
Let's welcome
the millennium together.

102
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,140
Okay.

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,980
I heard

104
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,540
that wishes made
on Millennium Night

105
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,860
always come true.

106
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,100
Of course.

107
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,860
It's even more effective
than making a wish to shooting stars.

108
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,700
How are you doing?

109
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,260
I'm doing well.

110
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,580
Wait for me then.

111
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,380
You come back so fast?

112
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,940
Can I come in?

113
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,300
No.

114
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,700
Chen Ling,

115
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,060
I've known that you two
have been together for a while.

116
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,540
I've already submitted
the divorce petition to the court.

117
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,420
Even if Xu Yi doesn't sign it,

118
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,180
we've already initiated
the divorce proceedings.

119
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,540
Are you willing to help me convince him?

120
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,860
I just want the custody of Wanwan.

121
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,780
Let's both give each other

122
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,100
a chance to start anew.

123
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,700
Mr. Li.

124
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,300
I'm on my way back now.

125
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,380
Alright, see you in a bit.

126
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,300
Anyone else wants to take the bus?

127
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,580
Where did you go?

128
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,860
Beijing.

129
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,900
What for?

130
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,540
To take an exam.

131
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,420
I almost forgot.

132
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,540
You need to take
the college entrance exam again, right?

133
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
Is it okay for me to sit here?

134
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,460
Anyone else wants to take the bus?

135
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,740
We will set off immediately.

136
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,940
We are leaving soon, lad.

137
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,820
We are leaving now.

138
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,940
So even wealthy people like you
take the minibus, huh?

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,740
Sir, let's depart.

140
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,260
I just came back

141
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,420
from a business trip.

142
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,580
Where do you want to go?

143
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,460
Qingshui.

144
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,260
Two yuan.

145
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,900
I hit you before

146
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,580
because I was angry.

147
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,660
I've compensated you with money

148
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,020
and I've been detained.

149
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,220
You should be able
to get over it, right?

150
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,020
I don't think
you have apologized to me yet.

151
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,220
Apologize?

152
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,660
They all say

153
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,180
you're very clever

154
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,220
and excel in your studies,

155
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,780
but there are some things

156
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,380
you can't learn from books.

157
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,860
I want to give you a piece of advice:

158
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,820
don't meddle in other people's affairs.

159
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,340
I only know that assaulting someone
is against the law.

160
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,330
Between husband and wife,

161
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,980
hitting and scolding each other
is a way of showing affection.

162
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,340
After some time,
we will be reconciled again.

163
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,420
It's not a big deal.

164
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,760
In the eyes of others,
you're just a joke,

165
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,700
don't you understand?

166
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,420
Has Nan Ya got over it yet?

167
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
You all saw me hitting Nan Ya.

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,540
Do you know

169
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,380
how good

170
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,020
Nan Ya is to me at home?

171
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,980
She takes care of me

172
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,500
and brings me food and drinks.

173
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,180
We've been
through all the dark times together.

174
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,020
Those dark times

175
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,980
have bound us tightly together.

176
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,540
We are inseparable.

177
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
Is that so?

178
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,860
Well, if that's the case,

179
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,220
why did she try to elope
with someone else?

180
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,500
All those

181
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,860
were just jokes.

182
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,820
We have a daughter.

183
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,980
We are bound by blood.

184
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,420
What does it mean to be bound by blood?

185
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,700
It means your genes

186
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,380
are intertwined

187
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,540
with someone else's.

188
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,170
They are so deeply entwined

189

Alright, you don't need
to tell me these things.

in your family affairs.

Just some casual shots.

199

Mr.  Li. It's nothing.

200
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,860
Just now, the bus jerked,

201

don't push me so hard.

then so be it.

211

If the police really come to me,

213
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,780

and you want me
to take the blame for you.

221
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,740
Well, we'll have to renegotiate
the price.

222
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,220
We can talk about it.

But let's talk

I'll give you a toast.

Over the years,

242
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,180
I've made you suffer,

243

but I've always remembered

I hope you can be happy.

250
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,460
You're not allowed to say
such pessimistic things.

251

I'm willing to stand by you forever.

We can just start anew.

259
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,020
We've missed each other
and taken wrong turns in the past,

260
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,260
so we should cherish
each other more now, shouldn't we?

261
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,660
Actually,

262
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,020
I'm content

to give me a firm commitment
to our future.

Okay.

275

She came here to see you?

277
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,980
Why did she come here?

278
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,300
She said

279
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,260
she knew everything.

280
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,740
She doesn't blame any of us.

281

As long as you're willing to divorce,

282
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,780
she won't demand anything else

283

but custody of Wanwan.

284
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,940
That's impossible.

285
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,820
She said that to me herself.

286
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,060
I'll never let her
have the custody of Wanwan!

287
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,900
We can have our own child.
Isn't that good?

You know,

289
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,500
Wanwan was raised by her mother
since she was little,

290
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,100
and she's closest to Nan Ya.

291
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,660

294

After you divorce Nan Ya,

299
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,540
she won't prevent you
from seeing your daughter.

300

You and your family
can also be reconciled.

You can't go without seeing them
for the rest of your life, right?

303

Besides, they can help you
with the bridge case.

304

Nan Ya won't come
and cause trouble again.

305

Don't you want to have
a normal family with me?

306

Don't you want to be with me openly?

only once

might make his life heavy.

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,460
As for who did this,

373
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,620
it's a secret between us.

374
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,380
I hope you leave yourself some leeway

375
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,180
and make sure
to treat my daughter's illness well.

376
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,060
I have been giving her good treatment
all along alright.

377
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,540
Every time she comes,
I do all the tests for her.

378
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,700
I make adjustments immediately

379
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,460
at the slightest change.

380
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,100
You can ask the Zhou family
if you don't believe me.

381
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,340
Thank you then.

382
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,900
Take this.

383
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,380
He is

384
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,260
very stubborn.

385
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,380
He's about to talk.

386
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
We can't rush it too much.

387
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,020
If we can't get any leads from him,
we'll have to release him.

388
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,740
Chen,

389
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,780
there's a call
from the forensic department

390
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,340
asking you to go over.

391
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,540
They said there's a new development.

392
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,460
A simple autopsy

393
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,220
makes it difficult to distinguish
between a backhand

394
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,060
and a forehand stab wound.

395
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,740
When I first

396
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,020
saw this wound,

397
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,340
I had a slight suspicion.

398
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,380
So, through repeated comparisons,

399
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,620
I found the issue.

400
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,900
Look,

401
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,500
Xu Yi's knife wound
is clearly on the right.

402
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,500
On the right?

403
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,300
Yes.

404
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,700
According to Nan Ya's testimony,

405
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,860
Xu Yi was trying to strangle her
at the time.

406
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,700
Nan Ya grabbed the knife from the table

407
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,020
and stabbed Xu Yi in the back
with a backhand motion.

408
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,940
It might be like this.

409
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,820
Choke me.

410
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,660
When Nan Ya stabbed Xu Yi in the back
with a backhand motion,

411
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,540
she was limited by her arm's length.

412
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,460
At this point,
she held the knife with her right hand,

413
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,140
and she must have stabbed
the left side of Xu Yi's back.

414
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,300
But now,

415
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,460
the wound was on the right side.

416
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,700
I'll make you die first.

417
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,900
I'll kill you.

418
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,220
While this action is within the range
of her arm's length,

419
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,660
reaching such a distant position

420
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,380
in a moment of urgency

421
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,820
seems unreasonable.

422
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,140
So, it's possible

423
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,980
that there could have been
a third person at the scene

424
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,620
who stabbed Xu Yi from behind.

425
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,740
But that's not why I asked you
to come here this time.

426
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,540
Do you have any discoveries?

427
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,940
The stab wound to Xu Yi's chest
was the fatal injury,

428
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,260
causing cardiac tamponade

429
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
and leading to his death.

430
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,700
During our previous autopsy examination,

431
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,420
we found that Xu Yi's wound
was a compound injury,

432
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,460
displaying noticeable pauses
in the knife cuts.

433
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,940
Through our analysis and comparison,

434
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,420
we discovered some new suspicious points

435
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,060
regarding the cause of the injury.

436
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,020
What does that mean?

437
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,500
Lowly woman.

438
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,300
If Xu Yi had slipped on the food

439
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,980
and fallen onto Nan Ya,
getting stabbed in the process,

440
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,340
his knife wound
should have been very smooth.

441
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,020
But now,

442
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,620
this knife wound shows traces
of back-and-forth pulling.

443
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,700
Could it be

444
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
that Nan Ya's wasn't that powerful,

445
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,400
causing the wound to look like this

446
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,580
during the process
of pulling out the knife?

447
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,380
It doesn't seem like the case.

448
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,060
It's more likely

449
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,180
that during the stabbing,

450
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,500
the two were struggling,

451
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,740
one desperately stabbing inward

452
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,940
while the other
grabbed the stabber's hand,

453
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,500
struggling to push it out,

454
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,740
causing the back-and-forth motion.

455
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,340
Now we need to make Zhou Luo confess.

456
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,940
So, who do you think killed Xu Yi?

457
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,260
From the evidence,

458
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,460
it should be Zhou Luo.

459
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,540
As for the blunt wound,

460
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,500
do you really think Nan Ya

461
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,780
could overpower a man?

462
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,660
So, what you're saying

463
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,740
is that Xu Yi was trying to kill
Zhou Luo at the time,

464
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,780
and during their struggle,

465
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,740
Nan Ya stabbed Xu Yi

466
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,540
from behind.

467
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,500
Which gave Zhou Luo the upper hand,

468
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,060
allowing him to plunge the knife
into Xu Yi's chest.

469
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,340
If that was the case,

470
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,020
it would require two knives.

471
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,060
Isn't that Nan Ya?

472
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,500
Her case for killing Xu Yi
has been settled?

473
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,260
So she's released now, right?

474
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,060
Isn't it considered self-defense?

475
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,500
Keep your voice down.

476
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,100
Mom.

477
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,500
It's her.

478
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,340
Yes, it's her.

479
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,700
After all, she did kill someone.

480
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,560
It's hard to believe
she just walked away

481
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,100
without any consequences.

482
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,060
The order of stabs could be different.

483
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,460
First, stabbing him,

484
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,100
then he fell down,

485
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,260
and they could stab him again.

486
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,660
Didn't the forensic examiner
just tell us

487
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,700
that the stab to the chest
was the fatal injury?

488
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,540
After Xu Yi was stabbed,
he would have fallen in agony

489
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,060
and been left with no power
to fight back.

490
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,060
So what exactly happened at the scene

491
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,300
to make the other person
stab him again?

492
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,100
We need to put some pressure on Zhou Luo

493
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,300
to find a lead through him.

494
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,500
I feel like the muffled voices

495
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,740
recorded in that cassette tape

496
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,780
are telling an unfinished story.

497
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,020
The tape has been sent
to the Provincial PSB for restoration.

498
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,340
It won't be back for a while.

499
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,660
Alright.

500
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,900
Let's split up.

501
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,580
You interrogate Zhou Luo.

502
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,900
As for me,

503
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,100
can I ask someone to go with me?

504
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,940
Who?

505
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,820
Let me send the child back.

506
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,500
You're living your life
as if nothing happened, huh?

507
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,740
You feel you are wronged

508
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,940
and helpless?

509
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,340
You're the one who killed Xu Yi.

510
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,220
Zhou Luo took the blame for you!

511
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm currently out on bail pending trial.

512
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,940
What bail pending trial?

513
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Then why was Zhou Luo arrested?

514
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,020
What really happened

515
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,020
that night?

516
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,580
Zhou Luo will be fine.

517
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,700
You are lying!

518
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
I waited outside his house all night.

519
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,060
He wasn't even there.

520
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,820
You're only concerned about yourself.

521
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,860
You don't care about his future at all.

522
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,820
Do you know how hard it is for him
to get admitted to Jinghua University

523
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,140
with a lower score?

524
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,900
You're just a big liar.

525
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,620
A big liar!

526
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,540
When the whole town laughed at you

527
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,700
and talked behind your back,

528
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,980
who was there to defend you?

529
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,060
We skipped the classes to help you.

530
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,180
You have no idea how much
we have done for you,

531
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,020
and the risks we took for you.

532
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,140
But don't tell me you forgot

533
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,580
who went to Xu Yi's company

534
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,100
to find Xu Yi with you
in the middle of the night.

535
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,980
You have a murderous heart.

536
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,740
Anyone who gets close to you
becomes unlucky.

537
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,540
No wonder even a good person
like Chen Ling hates you.

538
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,140
I'm not wrong.

539
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,940
You're still lying!

540
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,660
On his birthday,

541
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,300
I saw him coming out of your shop

542
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,900
all cheerfully.

543
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,940
When he was in the hospital,

544
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,500
you made him so restless.

545
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,420
Why?

546
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,540
Why is it that he always

547
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,180
has his eyes on you?

548
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,460
His emotions
are always affected by you.

549
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,140
Why?

550
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,740
Why?

551
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,020
Don't think nonsense, Zhang Qingli.

552
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,020
I don't want
to think nonsense either.

553
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,700
I'd rather believe
he's been lying to me.

554
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,660
I want to go to Beijing with him

555
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,180
and get into a good university.

556
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,100
Nan Ya.

557
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,940
Nan Ya, please, I beg you.

558
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,020
Tell me.

559
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Did you and Zhou Luo

560
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,860
secretly get together?

561
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,060
Nan Ya,

562
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,020
answer her.

563
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,580
Guixiang.

564
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,540
Why aren't you saying anything?

565
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,140
Nan Ya.

566
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,260
Did you seduce him?

567
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,380
I didn't.

568
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,140
Did you do it?

569
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,540
I didn't.

570
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,740
Did you seduce my Zhou Luo?

571
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,020
What exactly is your relationship then?

572
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,540
Tell me clearly today.

573
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,180
Zhou Luo

574
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,540
gave up his future for you.

575
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,020
Why?

576
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,700
You all claim to love Zhou Luo,

577
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,540
yet you come to my house
and pressure me.

578
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,460
Do you have to tarnish

579
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,340
his reputation?

580
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,580
You shut up!

581
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,020
Nan Ya,

582
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,180
hasn't the Zhou family treated you well?

583
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,700
Haven't I been good to Wanwan?

584
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,660
That's not what I'm saying.

585
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,340
Zhou Luo took beatings for you,
and I took care of Wanwan.

586
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,500
I even lent money to you
to pay Wanwan's medical expenses.

587
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,700
Why would you harm him?

588
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,780
I didn't.

589
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,700
In Qingshui Town,

590
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,340
you are the only ones
who treat me the best.

591
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,500
No one else.

592
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,500
Then why?

593
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,740
Why did he end up in the police station?

594
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,580
Tell me why!

595
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,460
I can't tell you.

596
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,740
Every word I speak could harm him.

597
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,540
Zhou Luo hasn't done

598
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,660
a single bad thing.

599
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,700
I won't allow it.

600
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,660
I won't allow you to ruin his life.

601
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,020
You need to go to the police station now

602
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,060
and tell the police

603
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,180
what you were hiding

604
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,980
that night.

605
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,340
Bring Zhou Luo back.

606
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,940
Zhou Luo didn't do anything wrong.

607
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,940
Guixiang.

608
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,980
You go back home

609
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,140
and wait.

610
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,940
Trust me.

611
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,900
He'll be back soon.

612
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,540
He'll be back soon.

613
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,500
I found a knife.

614
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,700
Where was the knife at that time?

615
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,340
It was on the table.

616
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,740
What did you do after you got the knife?

617
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,900
I told Xu Yi

618
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,060
not to come any closer.

619
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,300
If he came closer,
I would stab him with the knife.

620
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,980
He was holding an axe,
and you had a knife.

621
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,900
Yet you threatened him?

622
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,980
You would have been killed by the axe
before you could stab him.

623
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,820
That's not how it was.

624
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,340
He was just trying to scare me.

625
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,900
He didn't actually intend to hurt me.

626
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,100
You slipped.

627
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,380
If he hadn't actually attacked you,

628
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,500
then it wouldn't have been self-defense.

629
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
You slipped.

630
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,380
If he hadn't actually attacked you,

631
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,300
then it wouldn't have been self-defense.

632
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,460
Every word you say

633
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
could be scrutinized by the police,

634
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,500
leading to relentless questioning

635
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,460
and potentially causing
your entire statement to collapse.

636
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,740
So,

637
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,380
everything that happened tonight

638
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,340
needs to be deeply imprinted
in your mind

639
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,540
and acknowledged as reality.
