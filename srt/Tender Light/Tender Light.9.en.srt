[Episode 9]

2
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,620
Who's that?

3
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,060
Dad,

4
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,300
can you come out?

5
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,060
She's calling you.

6
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,540
Dad.

7
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,420
It was impossible for Xu Yi
to have the intention to kill Nan Ya.

8
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh, really?

9
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,380
You are not

10
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,420
getting over it.

11
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,700
I just know it.

12
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,580
Because that day,

13
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,500
he was with me before he went home.

14
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,380
He said he would divorce Nan Ya.

15
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,660
Ling,

16
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
you can't just say that.

17
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,820
Xu Jian was the mastermind

18
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
behind the bridge case.

19
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,660
He asked Xu Yi to let him
take over a part of the project

20
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,460
but got greedy
and caused the bridge to collapse.

21
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,420
If someone was to blame,

22
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,980
Xu Yi only took
very little responsibility for it.

23
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,260
Why would he kill someone for this?

24
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,860
Xu Yi and I

25
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,820
had got together long ago.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,460
[Tender Light]

27
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,380
He regretted

28
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,180
getting seduced by Nan Ya.

29
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,660
Doctor!

30
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,020
Doctor!

31
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,140
Anyone?

32
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,460
What's wrong with him?

33
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,380
He drank too much and had a stomachache.

34
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,620
Okay, go to the ER. Hurry up.

35
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,100
Okay.

36
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Does it still hurt here?

37
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
What's wrong?

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,060
Alcohol intoxication.

39
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,940
Get him an IV.

40
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,420
Ma'am, the IV is done.

41
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,740
I know you hate me.

42
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,340
I hate myself too.

43
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,900
Ling, see you.

44
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,140
Chen Ling.

45
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,740
Chen Ling!

46
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,340
Chen Ling.

47
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,980
Chen Ling, get in and I'll explain.

48
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,580
Chen Ling.

49
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,780
Chen Ling.

50
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,740
Let me go!

51
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,020
Chen Ling, listen to me.

52
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,220
Chen Ling.

53
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,260
Chen Ling, listen to me.

54
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,340
Get away!

55
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,580
I apologize.

56
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
I don't need your apology. Get away!

58
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,300
Give me another chance.

59
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,260
Chen Ling, listen to me.

60
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
After all these years,

61
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,380
I've just realized
who loves me the most.

62
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,700
Just hit me if you're mad at me.

63
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Are you not ashamed of saying that?

64
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,620
You liar!

65
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,540
Let me go.

66
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,700
Let me go!

67
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,740
I regret it so much.

68
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,340
For so many years,

69
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,900
I've never slept soundly.

70
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,860
I have no one to talk to.

71
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,860
Nor can I talk
about these things with anyone.

72
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,860
For her,

73
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,500
I've got gossiped about
and despised by everyone in town.

74
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,020
I have no home to go back.

75
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,260
She's got a lawyer

76
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,740
to sue me,

77
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
and she's taking away my daughter.

78
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,980
After all these years,

79
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,620
I've finally found
who loves me the most.

80
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,660
Chen Ling,

81
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,260
don't leave me.

82
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,380
Do not leave me.

83
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,140
Please don't leave me.

84
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,220
Don't leave me.

85
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Wanwan,

86
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,420
you're so brave.

87
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,700
Let's go home.

88
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,340
Okay.

89
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,140
Let's go!

[Nurses' Station]

[Benzylpenicillin sodium for injection]

92
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,340
Was it also you

93
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,820
who lived in Xu Yi's house?

94
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,580
Shame on you!

95
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,100
Dad!

96
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,500
Didn't you know
what kind of person he was?

97
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,460
Dad, it's been so many years.

98
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,060
Do you still not know

99
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,460
why I haven't got married?

100
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,460
It's okay to fall.

101
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,220
But you should never fall
into the same place.

102
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,580
He was nothing but a liar.

103
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,620
Do you remember

104
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,340
how he treated you back then?

105
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,860
But you were still willing
to be with him.

106
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,340
Have you forgotten all that?

107
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,300
He didn't lie to me.

108
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,460
Then why didn't he get divorced?

109
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,620
He was going to.
He just needed some time.

110
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,340
What was he waiting for?

111
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,100
Nan Ya was trying
to run off with Xu Jian.

112
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
How humiliating that was,

113
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,300
yet he didn't divorce!

114
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
That was fake.

115
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,220
It was Xu Jian and Xu Yi
putting on an act.

116
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,940
See? He was just a liar.

117
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,060
Dad,

118
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,420
Xu Yi attached great importance
to feelings.

119
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,060
He was doing that for Wanwan.

120
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,140
What a despicable man.

121
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,860
He deserved death.

122
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,380
How could you say that?

123
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,780
You said he was despicable,

124
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,620
but which man

125
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,780
would let that kind of thing

126
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,260
embarrass himself?

127
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,860
He was doing that for his daughter!

128
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,460
Then,

129
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,860
as for what happened
at the train station,

130
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,260
Nan Ya was the party at fault.

131
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,500
So if Xu had filed a lawsuit,
he would have won.

132
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,260
But why didn't he do it?

133
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,100
Soon after that,

134
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
the bridge collapsed.

135
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,380
Nan Ya kept making a scene.

136
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,980
To get custody of Wanwan,

137
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,020
Xu Yi had to calm her down

138
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,500
and not fall out with her.

139
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,260
He still wasn't going
to get divorced, was he?

140
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,620
On Millennium Night,

141
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,660
he said he would.

142
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,660
So soon?

143
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,620
Chen Ling.

144
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,500
I've known you are together.

145
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,860
I'm not here to blame you.

146
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
You're really not the one to do that.

147
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,060
You tried awfully hard

148
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,820
to steal my man,

149
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,380
but you can't keep him.

150
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,300
You don't get to blame anyone.

151
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,580
Chen Ling, do you really love Xu Yi?

152
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,740
That's none of your business.

153
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,580
At least, I cherish him
more than you do.

154
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,340
He won't be a good husband.

155
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,060
He's not a good one for you.

156
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,700
But at least, he's never abused me.

157
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,700
Maybe.

158
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,940
Maybe if I hadn't show up in his life,

159
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,820
he probably wouldn't
have ended up like this.

160
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,460
Yeah.

161
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,140
Maybe Xu Yi isn't that good,

162
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,060
but he is not bad.

163
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,420
Raised in a rich family,

164
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,300
he's been timid and overly cautious.

165
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,540
But a coward like him

166
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,340
cut his parents off

167
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
and got laughed at by everyone

168
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,820
for you.

169
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,810
He started to become violent
and hit people,

170
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,540
which caused him to be arrested.

171
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,580
Weren't those enough for you?

172
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,700
You tried so hard to get him.

173
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,940
Then why didn't you cherish him?

174
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,740
Look what he's like now.

175
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,540
All right.

176
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,340
I can give him back to you.

177
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,820
What belongs to me,

178
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,300
I can take it back whenever I want.

179
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,420
I mean

180
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,820
I'm willing to divorce him.

181
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,340
Can you persuade him for me?

182
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Aren't you the one
who doesn't want to get a divorce?

183
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,780
Threatening him with a sick kid,

184
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,140
how ruthless you are.

185
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,940
I can't believe
I sympathized with you before.

186
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,300
Who'd know you'd be so ungrateful?

187
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,220
And now you're asking me
to do this for you.

188
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,220
How do you have the brass to say that?

189
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,420
If I break up with him,

190
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,540
won't it be better for you?

191
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,860
What do you want?

192
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,140
Nothing

193
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,540

[Divorce Agreement]

196
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,660
You can talk him into it.

197
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,340
You don't want

198
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,220
to be the stepmother
of a sick kid, do you?

199
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,900
I can leave Qingshui Town

200
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,740
and disappear forever.

201
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,900
I will raise Wanwan on my own

202
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,620
and will not bother Xu Yi.

203
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
You can also have a child of your own.

204
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,420
A healthy one.

205
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,940
Nan Ya,

206
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,900
after so many years,

207
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,580
have you ever regretted it?

208
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,860
Have you thought this would happen?

209
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,700
I went to your place before.

210
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,980
I stood there for long,

211
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,420
wanting to apologize to you.

212
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,580
But I gave up,

213
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,500
not because I didn't feel guilty,

214
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,020
but because it was meaningless.

215
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,940
It wouldn't undo the harm to you,

216
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,220
nor would anything start over.

217
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,340
It would only make me feel better.

218
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,180
I admit that I owe you a lot.

219
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,700
I'd rather be the one getting hurt.

220
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Xu Yi made such a big scene
for his daughter,

221
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,380
and why would he agree
once you asked him to?

222
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,060
It was going to be the millennium.

223
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,700
He couldn't just drag it out.

224
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,140
He said

225
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
he would break up with Nan Ya

226
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,060
so we could be together
in broad daylight.

227
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,340
That day,

228
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,140
he got back from a business trip

229
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,420
and was exhausted

230
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,300
and frustrated.

231
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,060
I made him a lot of food,

232
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,900
and we drank together.

233
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,900
He sounded so defeated.

234
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
I said I would always
be there with him,

235
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,020
and he cried.

236
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,940
He said for so long,

237
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,540
the only person he was sorry for was me.

238
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,780
He had never forgotten me.
He still loved me.

239
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,780
He would divorce Nan Ya

240
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,100
and live a happy life with me.

241
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,500
Even if he hadn't die,

242
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,540
your mother and I would have never agreed!

243
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,900
No matter what you say,
he's already dead.

244
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,380
Nan Ya murdered him.

245
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,940
She planned everything.

246
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,380
That day,

247
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
I told her

248
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,020
Xu Yi had agreed to the divorce.

249
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,900
She was pretending to be grateful to me.

250
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,620
But it turned out

251
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,620
she killed Xu Yi that night!

252
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,020
Now as I think of it,

253
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,260
she came to figure out my thoughts
that afternoon.

254
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,740
She had been wanting to kill Xu Yi.

255
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,500
I was so stupid

256
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,940
and thought she agreed to the divorce.

275
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,980
Yeah, I've got something
to chat with him.

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,020
Didn't you see he just got home?

278
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,700
I did.

he didn't want to talk today,

281
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,060
so we'll talk later.

For a while,

If I had said it,

I would have been the one to blame!

312
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,620
No, she can't go. Please do something.

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,260
You've been a police officer
your whole life.

319
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,700
I've never asked you for anything,

320
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,940
but for this,

321
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,780
we must keep it a secret.

322
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,620
Then how do we solve the case?

It's not like Xu Yi was a good guy.

324
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
He's already dead

The chief has asked you
to hand in the report.

329
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,300
Just let her go.

330
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,140
She was beaten so badly

331
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,740
and was just miserable.

332
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,060
If every miserable person can get away,

00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,900
what is the law there for?

334
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,940
Even if you don't care about her,

335
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,020
think about our daughter.

00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,220
Look at you.

349
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,700
You look extraordinary.

350
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,620
I knew it.

many excellent talents.

Yes.

Now,

358
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,580
I've grown old

359
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,420
and often wake up

360
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,380
early in the morning.

361
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,460
So the first thing
of my daily routine is to come here.

362
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,460
You haven't changed at all.

363
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,500
I'm flattered.

364
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,340
Do you still work
in Qingshui No. 1 High School?

365
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,780
Yes.

366
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,060
I'm taking care of the graduating class.

367
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Oh, then

368
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,340
can I ask you about someone?

369
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,540
Who is that?

370
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,380

371
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,380
Zhou Luo...

372
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,900
is smart,

373
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,540
precocious,

374
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,180
and visionary.

375
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,260

were still messing around,

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
he had long had

379
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,940
his life planned.

380
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,660
I talked to him once.

381
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,660
He said he doesn't want
a white-collar job.

382
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,180
All he wants to do is commit
to engaging in scientific research.

383
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,260
He's really ambitious.

384
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,300
He loves physics.

385
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,620
I believe he can make it.

386
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,100
When he came back
from the university in Shanghai,

387
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,820
I was quite worried.

388
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,940
But now,

389
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
he's going to Jinghua University.

390
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,060
See?

391
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,900
I was right about him.

392
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,820
Fanglu,

393
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,420
you're still investigating
Nan Ya's case, right?

394
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,340
You were classmates before

395
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,300
and knew each other so much.

396
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,540
Back in the years,

397
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,300
you two were the best students.

398
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,460
Nan Ya had a strong personality,

399
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,580
and she was capable.

400
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,420
To be honest,

401
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,620
I even thought

402
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,820
she would be better than you.

403
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,340
Just read her essays

404
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,580
and I would know how ambitious she is.

405
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,060
Who'd have thought
she would end up like this?

406
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,500
Someone would say

407
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,460
it's her fate.

408
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,820
But I don't buy that.

409
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,020
Let me speak from the heart.

410
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,020
She is not a bad person.

411
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,820
You've got to know that.

412
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:38,270
[Request for Closure of Case]

413
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,060
Officer Lin.

414
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,940
Officer Lin,

415
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,900
the chief is asking
if the report is ready.

416
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,660
Come in.

417
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,020
Sir,

418
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,060
the closure report is ready.

419
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,460
Where is Lin Fanglu?

420
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,660
He's with the chief, Chen.

421
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,340
Liu,

422
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,180
call Xu Jian over.

423
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,300
Wang Yao,

424
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,140
go to the crime scene

425
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,100
and see if there are
Xu Jian's footsteps in Xu Yi's house.

426
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,500
What's wrong, Chen?

427
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,460
What do you mean? Get to work!

428
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,740
What's ECU's number?

429
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
ECU...

430
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
ECU... Here.

431
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,820
Hi, may I have Xu Jian on the phone?

432
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,140
I'm Chen from Qingshui police station.

433
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,660
Can I check if Xu Jian

434
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,220
is involved in the bridge case?

435
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,980
Okay...

436
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:06,620
Got it.

437
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,580
Thanks a lot.

438
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,260
Thanks.

439
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,540
Have you handed in the report?

440
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,540
Why?

441
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,020
Mark the shoe print.

442
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
And here.

443
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,500
Officer Lin,

444
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,260
Chen,

445
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,340
I've got the result.

446
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,060
It is Xu Jian's shoe print.

447
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,660
The ECU has also found out

448
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,180
the legal person of a company
undertaking the bridge's construction

449
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,620
is the fiance

450
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,100
of Xu Jian's wife's cousin.

451
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,140
The night Xu Yi died,

452
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,980
the last call he had

453
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,300
was from Xu Jian.

454
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,020
Xu Yi and Xu Jian were supposed
to be enemies.

455
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,300
Why did they do business together?

456
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,260
It's not true.

457
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,660
It's all fake.

458
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,100
I really have nothing to do with Nan Ya.

459
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,220
It's Hu Xiu

460
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
who saw her buying tickets.

461
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,780
Xu Yi

462
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,060
wanted to stop her,

463
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,620
so he asked us to put on an act

464
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,220
and let everyone believe
she cheated on him.

465
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,860
Then if she wanted a divorce,

466
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,180
she wouldn't get Wanwan.

467
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,700
We had no choice, right?

468
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,180
Look at us.

469
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,460
We've been relying on Xu Yi's family.

470
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,820
Why did you go
to Xu Yi's house that night?

471
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,140
To negotiate with him.

472
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
About what?

473
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,780
About the bridge.

474
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,780
A lot of things

475
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,220
were instructed by Xu Yi
behind the scenes.

476
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
He had asked me to find someone reliable

477
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,660
to open a company.

478
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,500
And it must be
someone not too close to us.

479
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,700
It was actually to launder the money.

480
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,740
Liu Changshui is from our company.

481
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,460
The process was

482
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,820
my company would get the money,

483
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,860
and then

484
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,260
the money would be
laundered through procurement.

485
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,220
And all the money
actually went into his pocket.

486
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,620
That's why he bought
all the poor-quality products.

487
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,460
I told him

488
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,900
it's too risky

489
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,140
and not to do it.

490
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,100
He just wouldn't listen.

491
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
He was too greedy.

492
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,860
And then?

493
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,060
The bridge collapsed.

494
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,820
But I really didn't know

495
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,260
this could lead to people's deaths.

496
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,300
Then what were you

497
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,460
going to do?

498
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,340
He wanted me to take it all on

499
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,340
and offered me a good amount of money.

500
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,060
How much was it?

501
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,700
A million.

502
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,060
But I didn't say yes.

503
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,860
How could I? It's too risky.

504
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,100
I would end up in jail
for those two people's deaths.

505
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,340
I have a family. I would never do that.

506
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,260
So were you trying to blame this
on Liu Changshui?

507
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,940
Don't think Liu Changshui was innocent.

508
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,060
Every buyer

509
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,540
would reap some profit from it.

510
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,940
He was asking for too much.

511
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,020
He insisted

512
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,220
on making his child rich immediately.

513
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,380
Of course, Xu Yi wouldn't agree,

514
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,780
and he was going to sort him.

515
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,220
So you decided

516
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,300
to negotiate with him

517
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,340
on the eve.

518
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,860
I had no choice.

519
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,940
I couldn't find him anywhere.

520
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,780
He wouldn't answer my call.

521
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,020
This scum

522
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,860
could do everything to make money.

523
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,580
He would run away quickly
if anything came up.

524
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,860
Your chat with him didn't go well,

525
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,940
so you and Nan Ya

526
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,380
planned together and killed him.

527
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,500
You can't say this.
I didn't kill anyone.

528
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,860
I really had nothing to do with Nan Ya.

529
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,140
Or why would Xu Yi ask me

530
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,660
to work on the project with him?

531
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,140
Then why didn't you use the front door?

532
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,180
You got over the wall.

533
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,900
I...

534
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,420
I...

535
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,100
When I got there,

536
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,020
I heard them quarreling in the house.

537
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,460
I wanted to figure out
what they were arguing about.

538
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,220
What were they arguing about?

539
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,780
Xu Yi said Nan Ya was cheating on him.

540
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,140
He also mentioned the act we put on

541
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,780
to frame Nan Ya.

542
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,940
I didn't catch anything else.

543
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,220
And then?

544
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,980
So I thought it wasn't a good time
to negotiate with him.

545
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,900
So I left.

546
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,700
What were you going to do?

547
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,740
I've got something on him.

548
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
What was it?

549
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,700
I stalked him once

550
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,100
and took a photo.

551
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,620
Was it this one?

552
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,580
Yes.

553
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,580
When did you take it?

554
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,220
After Xu Yi turned Liu Changshui in

555
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,620
and ran off with the money.

556
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,660
They had it all planned.

557
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,180
I saw

558
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,900
how they chatted sneakily

559
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
in Xu Yi's restaurant outside the town.

560
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,980
Did he have a restaurant there?

561
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,340
Yeah, I bought it for him.

562
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,380
The business didn't go well.

563
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,740
I asked him to sell it,
but he just wouldn't.

564
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,980
Now as I think of it,

565
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,260
it was where they colluded.

566
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,340
Sounds like he trusted you a lot.

567
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,540
It's not like that.

568
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,500
He had control over me
with his money and power.

569
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,260
Honestly, over the years,

570
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,220
I really cleaned up
a lot of mess for him.

571
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,060
He asked me to launder his money,

572
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,900
and I did it.

573
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,260
When the bridge collapsed,

574
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,620
he wanted to pass the buck to me.

575
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,700
And Nan Ya,

576
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,940
when he was having an affair with her,

577
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,980
he asked me to lie to Chen Ling...

578
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,420
Continue.

579
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,260
How did you lie?

580
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,300
Well,

581
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,620
he asked me to buy
off the ticket clerk in the theater

582
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,380
and pretended they were
watching a film that night.

583
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,420
But they were actually

584
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,900
messing around in the dorm.

585
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,940
So you're saying

586
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,580
that day,

587
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,500
they didn't go to the theater.

588
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,540
That's right.

589
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,460
Or why would I

590
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,660
buy off the clerk?

591
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,260
Here.

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,860
Have some meat.

593
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,860
Have some.

594
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,420
What's on your mind?

595
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,620
I was just thinking

596
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,980
about the day

597
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,380
Xu Yi messed around with Nan Ya...

598
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,260
Thanks.

599
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,460
...was the day Hu Lifan died.

600
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,850
[Hu Lifan, Male,
the son of Hu Xiu, Nan Ya's stepmother]

601
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,380
[Reported missing on September 30, 1994]

602
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,780
Anything to do with that?

603
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,140
He has been missing for so many years,

604
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,300
but his body hasn't been found.

605
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,020
I thought he was killed

606
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,660
by the gang leader who was shot.

607
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,980
Those were all circumstantial witnesses.

608
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,580
They were all others' sayings

609
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,220
and speculations.

610
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,620
Qiu Kuan

611
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,740
got shot.

612
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,980
The case wasn't even solved
when he died.

613
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,460
But hearing what Xu Jian said,

614
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,740
I feel

615
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,300
something was off.

616
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,300
What was that?

617
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,740
Think about it.

618
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,860
If he wanted to lie to Chen Ling,

619
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,100
why did he have

620
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,500
to buy off a ticket clerk?

621
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
What are you suspecting?

622
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,860
Hu Lifan is Nan Ya's stepbrother.

623
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,420
They never got along.

624
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,460
When he was reported missing,

625
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,580
only pieces of fragments
with blood on them were found.

626
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,300
But Hu Xiu just claimed

627
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,500
it was Nan Ya who killed him.
