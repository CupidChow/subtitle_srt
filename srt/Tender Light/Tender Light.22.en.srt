00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,780
You...

3
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,820
Why are you out?

4
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,980
Auntie,

5
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,620
I heard you're seriously ill.

6
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,340
So I came to see you.

7
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,140
I've never loved him.

8
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,020
He's just a naive young boy.

9
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,980
I've been through so much.

10
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,180
I won't pin my hopes

11
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,220
on a man anymore.

12
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,300
There's no one
taking the blame for anyone here.

13
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,900
Life isn't a novel.
It's not that romantic.

14
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,580
Even if Zhou Luo
is impulsive and immature,

15
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,900
he's still an adult, isn't he?

16
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,180
Doesn't he know

17
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,980
the consequences of killing someone?

18
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,900
Besides, he's so smart.

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,660
He has a bright future.

20
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,860
And he can find a better girl
in the future.

21
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,420
Is it worth killing a person
for a moment of infatuation?

22
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,340
Anyway, Xu Yi was holding an axe
trying to kill me,

23
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,940
I couldn't just stand there
and wait to die.

24
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,020
I don't know what the future holds.

25
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,340
If you think it is self-defense,

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,980
then I'm innocent.

27
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
If not,

28
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,220
then just sentence me.

29
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,460
Stop involving
irrelevant people and things in this.

Don't make up
some romantic love story or gossip.

If there's anyone in this world

32
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,500
who truly loved me,

33
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,700
it would be my mother.

34
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,620
She passed away long ago.

35
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,220
Don't you trust me?

36
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
I'm telling you to trust no one,

37
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,820
including me.

[Autumn, 1999]

41
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,300
Are you cold?

42
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,660
It was a bit cold
when I first got in the water.

43
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,700
Now, I feel

44
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,980
all hot.

45
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,580
Do you feel like your skin's on fire?

46
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,100
The colder the water,

47
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,660
the hotter your skin will be

48
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,180
after you get out of the water.

49
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,500
It's like every cell in your body
has been activated.

50
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,500
Even you feel more clear-headed.

51
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
So, is this

52
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,020
the reason why you came here?

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
I came here to remind myself.

54
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,100
Remind yourself of what?

55
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,860
To live.

56
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,820
Dying is easy,

57
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
but I have Wanwan.

58
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,460
I don't have that kind of freedom.

59
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,980
I can't die.

60
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,100
People who should die are them.

61
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,460
Wanwan will sleep at my place tonight.

62
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,220
I'll bring her over
early morning tomorrow.

63

No need.

64
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,300
I'll go pick her up myself
tomorrow morning.

65
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,540
You should go back now.

66
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,300
Don't come to see me again.

From the assessment of your injuries,

71
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,020
the situation is quite serious.

72
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,500
So, we've helped you
apply for legal aid.

73

This is Mr. Gao, a lawyer

74
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,620
who is very experienced in this field.

75
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,740
He'll support you throughout the process
of safeguarding your rights.

76
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,740
Thank you.

77
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,020
Mr. Gao,

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,060
I just want to get a divorce.

79
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,260
I want to know if I can

80
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,340
get custody of the child in this case.

81
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,100
It was almost a sure thing,

82
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,300
but the train station incident

83
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,580
has turned the tide against you.

84
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,780
That whole thing
was orchestrated by Xu Yi.

85
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,860
But this might be
Xu Yi's premeditated strategy.

86
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,540
He intentionally made
such a scene in a crowded place

87
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,460
to make more people witness it.

88
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,300
There were countless eyewitnesses

89
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,860
seeing him and Xu Jian's wife
catching you in the act.

90
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,420
Now, you're left with no way
to defend yourself

91
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,940
because no one would believe

92
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,980
that someone would willingly tarnish
their own reputation

93
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,420
with such disgraceful facts.

94
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,900
But I was beaten by him,

95
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,900
and everyone saw that.

96
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,220
Although that's true,

97
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,700
in the extreme situation
of catching someone in adultery,

98
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,300
it might be considered a valid reason.

99
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Now, the domestic violence issue

100
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
is clear,

101
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,820
but you've become the one at fault

102
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,180
for the marriage breakdown.

103
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,340
Plus, you don't have
a stable income now,

104
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,740
so you don't have much advantage

105
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,940

106
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,620
No,

107
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,980

Please stay calm.

109

Although we don't have much advantage,

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,540
it doesn't mean we will definitely fail.

111
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,780
You can try to speak to Xu Jian's wife

112
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,220
and persuade her to testify for you.

113
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,460
That's not possible.

114
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,740
Well, I'll think of another way then.

115
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,660

You want to get away now?

186
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,060
No way!

187
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,780
Oh, by the way,

188
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,860
I know more lawyers
in this town than you do.

189
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,220
I can introduce a good one to you.

190
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,780
Please help me look for someone.

191
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,500
Who are you?

192
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,180
I have a friend who stays here,

193
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,980
but I don't know his room number.

194
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,860
Name?

195
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,780
Xu Yi.

196
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,740
There's no such person.

197
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,500
Chen Ling.

198
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,100
She just checked out and left.

199
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,020
Did she stay here alone
or with someone else?

200
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,960
Are you really looking for someone

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,100
or is there something else
you are up to?

202
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,060
Nothing. Thanks.

203
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,540
You're home?

204
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,900
Why didn't you open the door for me?

205
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,620
Not opening the door
means you're not welcome here.

206
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,540
Why are you coming over so late?

207
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,620
I brought you something.

208
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,780
These are divorce cases similar to yours

209
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,540
that I found online.

210
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
You can take a look for reference.

211
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,380
Also,

212
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,820
I found evidence

213
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,140
that's particularly advantageous
for you.

214
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,340
Xu Yi and Chen Ling

215
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,660
were having an affair
at the Seagull Hotel in the city.

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,380
Does this have anything to do with you?

217
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,420
What you care most is Wanwan, right?

218
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,220
With this evidence, you can...

219
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,380
I've known about this for a long time.

220
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,460
This is my own business.

221
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,900
It has nothing to do with you.

222
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,420
From now on,
you're not allowed to follow me,

223
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,220
come to my shop,

224
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,420
approach Wanwan,

225
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,940
or climb over the wall to see me

226
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,420
at my house in the middle of the night.

227
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,420
You're basically telling me to go die.

228
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,780
Why is it so easy for you to die?

229
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,260
Do you understand what death is?

230
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,660
Those who truly wish to die

231
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,180
do so silently.

232
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,340
You're too naive.

233
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,420
Could you please not
have this attitude towards me?

234
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,980
Have you listened
to the tape I gave you?

235
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,340
I've burned it.

236
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,300
Now, leave.

237
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm not leaving.

238
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,020
Aren't you helping me
just to sleep with me?

239
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,300
Will you be satisfied
once you've slept with me?

240
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,060
Alright then.

241
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,860
Come on.

242
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,820
Come on.

243
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,700
Enough!

244
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,740
Make way, please.

245
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,300
Make way!

246
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,300
Lift the stretcher.

247
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,980
Hurry!

248
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,540
Move aside.

249
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,180
Why would I sign such an agreement?

250
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,180
I'm in a dire situation,

251
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,020
asking around for help
like a beggar every day.

252
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,460
You want me to sign this?

253
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,820
Get lost!

254
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,180
Mr. Liu.

255
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,460
Mr. Liu,

256
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,260
I'm really at my wit's end now.

257
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,300
Can you help me think of a solution?

258
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,940
[Shengda Construction Company]
I'll cover the deficit in the account.

259
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,980
No problem.

260
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,620
But the deceased's family members
are still at my construction site.

261
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,660
I'll pay all the funeral expenses

262
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,620
and medical bills. That's totally fine.

263
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,740
Bro, you have to help me this time.

264
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,580
I'm also a victim.

265
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,740
You knew it.

266
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:20,660
Xu Yi.

267
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm warning you.

268
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,420
Stop following me!

269
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,020
If you sign this,
I won't follow you anymore.

270
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,660
Just give up, will you?

271
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,700
Xu Yi!

272
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,380
Xu Yi.

273
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,020
Xu Yi.

274
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,380
Uncles,

275
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,340
and leaders,

276
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,300
I will propose a toast.

277
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,620
Uncle Yan is a longtime subordinate
of my father.

278
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,020
He has watched me grow up
since I was a child.

279
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,180
Mr. Liu has always treated me
like his younger brother,

280
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,940
caring for me very much.

281
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,780
Today, I have encountered some trouble,

282
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,700
but I didn't expect

283
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,460
all of you leaders and uncles

284
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,140
to still be here.

285
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,380
I'm really honored.

286
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,580
I'll down it first, cheers.

287
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,980
Don't rush it.

288
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,620
We might not

289
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,780
be able to help you with this.

290
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,300
Yeah, it's such a big issue,

291
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,500
and we can't just suppress it.

292
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,220
Xu Yi,

293
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,460
I had high hopes for you

294
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,420
when I assigned this project to you.

295
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,540
I didn't expect it
to stir up such big trouble.

296
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,540
How do I explain this to my higher-ups?

297
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,820
Mr. Liu.

298
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,100
Please don't be angry.

299
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,460
You're right.
Everything you said makes sense.

300
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,180
It's my fault
for not supervising properly.

301
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,140
I subcontracted

302
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,980
this project to that company,

303
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,100
but I didn't expect them to cut corners

304
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,700
and even alter the blueprints
without authorization.

305
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,780
I would never do
such deceptive practices.

306
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,740
You shouldn't subcontract it
to another company,

307
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,980
do you know that, Xu Yi?

308
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,580
I went to the city for a meeting
a few days ago,

309
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,540
and they've already
set up a special task force.

310
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,900
They'll be sending people
down here soon.

311
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,740
There will be people
sent by the higher-ups?

312
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,700
Exactly.

313
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Xu Yi,

314
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,380
you're really trying to ruin me
this time, aren't you?

315
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,580
Calm down,

316
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,380
Uncle Yan.

317
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,940
Please, can you help me out again?

318
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,700
I... I've already helped you a lot.

319
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,620
I've invited all these people here
to help you out.

320
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,420
Now you're dragging us all down
with you.

321
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,300
Xu Yi, when are you going to repay
the money you owe me?

322
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,060
Don't blame us
for turning our backs on you.

323
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,100
Yes, repay the money.

324
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,580
If you repay the money,
we can discuss things.

325
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm sorry, there are guests inside.
You can't go in right now.

326
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,180
We have guests inside. You can't...

327
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,900
I'm Xu Yi's wife.

328
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,060
Allow me to propose a toast
to all of you first.

329
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,620
What's going on?

330
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,020
I've got something
really important today.

331
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,460
Don't stir up trouble.

332
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,380
Since they're all your people,

333
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,140
there's no harm in telling them.

334
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,940
Xu Yi's been abusing me for a long time.

335
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,540
I've been trying to divorce him
for two years but to no avail.

336
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,260
Never mind.

337
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,460
If this continues,
I'll end up dead at his hands.

338
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,300
Nan Ya.

339
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,980
Since you're here
to solve problems today,

340
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,780
please, leaders,

341
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,580
help me resolve this matter too.

342
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,820
There are many secrets
between Xu Yi and me.

343
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,660
I'll spill the beans
to lighten the mood.

344
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,980
Xu Yi.

345
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,260
Would you like to hear the story?

346
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
I'm sorry,

347
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,620
this is a family matter.

348
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,060
Please, enjoy your meal.

349
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,980
You lowly woman,

350
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
are you trying

351
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
to bully me

352
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,860
while I'm now in trouble?

353
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,540
Let me tell you,

354
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,940
if I die,

355
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,900
you and Wanwan
won't live a happy life either.

356
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,100
I'll keep causing trouble

357
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,020
until we get divorced.

358
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,940
What am I afraid of?

359
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm already living like this.

360
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,180
Living in the hell couldn't be worse.

361
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Get out of here.

362
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,380
Get away!

363
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,020
I'm not leaving.

364
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,500
If you have the guts,
go ahead and kill me.

365
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,620
I'll be waiting right here for you,

366
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,860

367

waiting for them to come out

368
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,460
and hear our story.

369
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,900
I'm telling you,

370
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,380
you better stop her.

371
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,060
If she comes in to cause trouble again,

372
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,140
I'll make sure
this restaurant will close down.

373
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,620
These two people
are both unreliable.

374
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,140
Why haven't you left yet?

375
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,100
We're about to close.

376
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,500
Can't you even accept me
holding you umbrella?

377
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,380
I've told you before,

378
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,420
that my affairs
have nothing to do with you.

379
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,940
How can it have nothing to do with me?

380
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,700
How can you say that?

381
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,020
You're driving me crazy, you know that?

382
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,860
Sometimes you're distant,
and sometimes you're close.

383
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,700
Sometimes you say you're leaving,

384
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,820
but sometimes you're like a stranger.

385
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,100
Do you have a heart at all?

386
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,540
Tell me, what should I do?

387
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,540
What on earth should I do

388
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,420
so that you can understand
my feelings for you?

389
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,300
I've always understood.

390
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,460
I just don't accept it and I don't care.

391
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't want to see you

392
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,060
acting so sentimental.

393
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,940
Love is nothing.

a sentimental fool,

414
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,620

I'd like to play with them.

00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,980
Alright then,
you can play with them for a bit.

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,140
I'll go heat your medicine.

She was playing
with the kids at the gate.

451
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,540
I only went inside
to heat the medicine,

452
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,500
and she was gone.

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,940
Zhou, you didn't see her
coming here, right?

454
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,580
No, I didn't.

455
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,340
Have you checked

456
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,420
all the places she often goes to?

457
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,060
I just checked some places,

458
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,660
and the kids said they hadn't seen her.

459
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,460

498
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,140
- No.
- No.

499
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,500
So she hasn't been here, right?

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,540

504
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,500
have you seen my daughter Wanwan around?

505
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,180
No.

506
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,380
I've even searched in the mountains
this afternoon.

507
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,980
It's been a whole day.

508
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,240
It's getting dark now.

509
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,900
Where do you think
this child could have gone?

510
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Wanwan used to be very obedient.

511
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,380
She never used to run around.

512
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,580
Yes.

513
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,100
You are back.

514
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,700
So?

515
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Which places have you searched?

516
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,300
We looked for her along the river too.

517
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,060
But we didn't see her.

518
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,260
None of you saw her?

519
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,820
Yeah.

520
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,740
Where could such a little kid go?

521
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
I hope she hasn't encountered
any bad people.

522
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,860
Mom, can you please not say that?

523
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,180
Madam Guixiang.

524
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,340
How about we call the police then?

525
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,220
Right, let's call the police.

526
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,620
Could it be her dad who took her away?

527
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,100
Guixiang, can I borrow your phone
for a moment?

528
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,140
Of course.

529
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,900
Well...

530
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,420
We've been looking for her everywhere

531
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,820
but we forgot about her dad.

532
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,740
Just dial it directly.

533
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,660
Hello.

534
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,060
Is Wanwan with you?

535
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,780
Yes, she is.

536
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,180
Xu Yi, what are you trying to do?

537
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,060
If you keep pushing me,

538
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,940
I'll send her away,

539
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,260
and you'll never see her again.

540
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,020
Xu Yi, do you have a heart at all?

541
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,780
You know about Wanwan's condition.

542
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,940
I'm the only one who knows

543
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,500
how to take care of her, her medication,
her diet, and everything.

544
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,180
Don't involve the child

545
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,380
in our affairs, please.

546
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,220
I'm begging you,

547
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,620
just bring Wanwan back to me, okay?

548
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,500
You're divorcing me, aren't you?

549
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,940
It's only natural for the child
to be with her father.

550
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,860
Hello, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

551
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,420
All right.

552
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,980
At least, we now know
she's with her father.

553
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
He's her dad after all.

554
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,380
He won't mistreat her.

555
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,660
Guixiang, you don't understand.

556
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,700
Wanwan has always been afraid of Xu Yi
since she was little.

557
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,380
Now, with the sudden change
of living environment

558
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,420
and her medication being interrupted,
I'm worried about her health.

559
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,220
No, I'm going to see Xu Yi right now.

560
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,820
Don't go toe-to-toe with him.

561
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,580
I'm going too.

562
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,740
Zhou Luo.

563
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,300
Zhou Luo.

564
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,220
Madam Guixiang, we'll go with him.

565
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,980
You are all going together?

566
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,900
We'll all go with him.

567
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,980
Don't worry.

568
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,620
Chen Jun,

569
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,820
why don't we go to see your dad first?

570
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,020
Otherwise, if we go to Xu Yi's company

571
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,540
and he doesn't hand over Wanwan,
we won't have any other options.

572
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,140
Alright.

573
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,180
Then I'll go to see my dad first

574
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,860
and ask him to bring along more men.

575
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,380
Okay.

576
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,740
Bing, you go with Qingli.

577
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,220
Okay.

578
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,500
[Shengda Construction Company]

579
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,780
Why hasn't Chen Jun arrived yet?

580
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,860
They would reach here
before us if they were driving.

581
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,020
I can't wait any longer,
I'll go up and take a look first.

582
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,740
Zhou Luo!

583
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,020
He's here.

584
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,700
They refused to come,

585
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,980
saying they couldn't respond
to this type of emergency.

586
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,060
Why?

587
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,060
My dad says they're not divorced yet.

588
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,980
He says it can't be filed when the dad
takes the child away in this situation.

589
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,100
So, we can only
forcefully take the kid back.

590
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,060
Let's go!

591
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,620
Okay.

592
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,100
I'll cover your back.

593
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,580
Be careful.

594
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,380
Be careful.

595
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,140
They left so fast.

596
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,500
Think about it,

597
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,260
are there any other places

598
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,580
that Xu Yi might have gone to?

599
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,900
Did he take her back
to his parents' house?

600
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,460
That's impossible.

601
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,140
He's had a falling-out with his parents.

602
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,740
Did Xu Yi take Wanwan's medicine?

603
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,260
No.

604
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,740
Then he'll definitely go
to the hospital tomorrow

605
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,300
to get a prescription.

606
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,580
You should all go home.

607
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,100
Nan Ya.

608
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,500
Alright, let's split up
into two groups tomorrow.

609
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,900
You two find a secluded spot

610
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,100
to keep an eye on Xu Yi from here

611
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,500
and figure out where he lives.

612
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,060
The three of us will ambush him
at the hospital tomorrow.

613
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,300
I'll get going now.

614
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,860
Don't worry.

615
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,100
Zhou Luo.

616
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,780
Be careful.

617
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,420
There's no other way out.

618
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,540
You should go home now.
