00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,540
Officer Lin.

3
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,740
Could you tell us more
about this, please?

4
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,820
Dear friends from the press.

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,140
I've told you many times already.

6
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,900
The case is still ongoing.

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,500
I can't take in-depth reporting now.

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,420
Sorry about that.

9
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:51,820
Thank you.

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,860
Officer Lin.

11
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,740
Officer Lin.

[Tender Light]

13
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,900
I heard you are going to release Nan Ya?

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,620
She and Xu Yi killed my son.

15
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,020
Why is she not sentenced?

16
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,820
Hu Xiu!

17
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,620
What are you doing?

18
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,820
This is the police station.

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,820
Sentence her or not is up to the judge.

20
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,580
We're still investigating the case.

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,020
It's all about the evidence.

22
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,300
You think I don't know?

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,380
You're just covering up for her!

24
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,660
You two were classmates.

25
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,260
She killed my son!

26
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,220
She has to pay me money

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,340
and go to jail!

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,140
She has to give the Nan family's house
to me as compensation as well!

29
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,180
Otherwise, I'll kill myself
in front of you!

30
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,220
Hu Xiu, that's enough!

31
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,820
Your own problem hasn't been solved yet.

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,780
Watch yourself!

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,820
Liu.

34
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,940
Come on.

35
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,300
Reporters!

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,620
Don't go.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,620
That's enough. We'll let everyone know
if there's an update.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,860
Please don't get in the way of our work.

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,740
You may leave now.

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,580
Zhang, see them out.

41
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,540
Hey, but...

42
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,420
No buts.

43
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,220
We'll inform you if there's anything.

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,060
You can leave now.

45
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,580
Where's Chen?

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,180
Never mind him. Everything is
coincidently happening at once today.

47
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,100
Xu Yi's family
also came and made a scene.

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,900
They almost bumped into Hu Xiu
and Liu Changshui's family.

49
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,780
Chen sent them away.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,140
Where are Liu Changshui's
family members?

51
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,300
In the meeting room.

52
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,060
Have some water.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,860
Please wait for a while.

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,180
Officer Lin.

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,980
The bridge case and Xu Yi's case
are connected with each other.

56
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,300
They are still being investigated.

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,660
You must not talk to others

58
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,340
about anything
that might be related to the case.

59
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,820
If you have any questions or requests,

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,140
feel free to tell me.

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Allow me, then.

62
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,700
Hu Xiu is demanding for compensation.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,180
So we can also
have some compensation, right?

64
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,660
Liu Changshui couldn't die for nothing.

65
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,980
In terms of civil compensation,

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,100
we can register a case

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,620
and wait for the procuratorate

68
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,980
to include a civil lawsuit
when prosecuting.

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,860
We have to sue?

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,940
Sue whom, though?

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,100
Xu Yi's assets

72
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,500
are shared with Nan Ya.

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,700
Half of it can be used
to make compensation.

74
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,180
However,

75
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,300
due to the bridge case,

76
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,660
his assets have been frozen.

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Moreover, there are many problems
to be solved.

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,580
I'm afraid

79
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,780
it will be a long process.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,340
And ultimately,

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,540
you may not

82
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,900
get that much compensation.

83
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,380
Nan Ya killed Xu Yi, didn't she?

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,100
She can still get half of his money.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,140
It doesn't make any sense.

86
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,700
It's not such simple logic.

87
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,700
What a bothersome day.

88
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,260
The case is complicated.

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,420
You could consult a lawyer

90
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,220
and find out more information about it.

91
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,020
The wife should pay
for the husband's debt.

92
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,060
That's how it is, right?

93
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,700
More reason for her to pay
because she killed Xu Yi.

94
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,540
Then, there are Xu Yi's parents.

95
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,220
His family is wealthy.

96
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,740
They should at least...

97
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,260
The law stipulates

98
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,100
that unless Xu Yi is a minor,

99
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,940
otherwise, his parents

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,900
are not obliged to recompense
on behalf of him.

101
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,420
Well, shouldn't they be responsible

102
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,340
for raising such a son?

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,940
Have some water.

104
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,700
Don't get so worked up.

105
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,420
I understand your sentiment.

106
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,020
But Liu Changshui was one

107
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,700
of the principal people in charge
of the bridge case.

108
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,620
Now that he died,

109
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,540
are you going to recompense
on his behalf?

110
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,860
You...

111
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,980
Now, you're just intimidating us.

112
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,620
We lost a family member.

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,980
It's just my son and me now.

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,820
Why aren't you saying anything?

115
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,780
They're trying to intimidate us.

116
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,380
Say something!

117
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,740
They want us to pay.

118
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,340
How can we pay?

119
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,780
Nan Ya.

120
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,220
It's all because of Nan Ya.

121
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,780
If she hadn't killed Xu Yi,

122
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,260
then...

123
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,260
Then Xu Yi's money

124
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,300
would've definitely
been given to us, right?

125
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,540
Listen.

126
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,580
I think Nan Ya killed Xu Yi

127
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,380
for money.

128
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,340
You all should ask her for money, right?

129
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,340
Mom,

130
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,780
stop making a scene.

131
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,540
I'm making a scene?

132
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,180
Your dad left us a mess.

133
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,660
And you're not doing anything.

134
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,260
I'm so unlucky that I ended up
neither a good husband

135
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,100
nor a good son.

136
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,500
I should just go die.

137
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,220
Liu.

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,900
Officer Lin,

139
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,580
I just want to know.

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,620
Why did Xu Yi kill my dad?

141
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,580
When he was still alive,

142
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,740
he had blackmailed Xu Yi.

143
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,780
That was likely the reason

144
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,220
he was killed.

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,540
What made you say that?

146
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,380
Take a look at this photo.

147
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,620
This was the last time
your father showed up.

148
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,180
This restaurant was owned by Xu Yi.

149
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,940
It was only 2 kilometers
from where the body was hidden.

150
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,460
You followed me?

151
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,060
Did you take these photos?

152
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,660
You little scoundrel.

153
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,140
You're a loser, just like your dad!

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,060
Darn loser!

155
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,980
You want to mess with me too?

156
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,780
Liu Xun.

157
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,620
Think back carefully.

158
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,980
After the bridge collapsed,

159
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,020
did your father talk to you

160
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,620
about money matters?

161
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,500
You're back.

162
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Are you confident
about the college entrance exam?

163
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,260
Dad.

164
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,420
Don't worry.

165
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,260
I'll definitely make it this time.

166
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,580
And I'm going to get a higher grade
than Zhou Luo too.

167
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,140
Good.

168
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,580
Very ambitious.

169
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,940
Come.

170
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,980
Now,

171
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,300
I've prepared some money for you.

172
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,260
It's for you to go to university.

173
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,900
You can also pursue further study

174
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,020
if you want.

175
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,100
I can afford it.

176
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,300
All I ask is that you come back

177
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,100
to visit your mom when you're free.

178
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,820
No, he didn't.

179
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,820
If you're hiding something,

180
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,780
it won't help us

181
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,580
solve the case.

182
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,020
I'm not hiding anything.

183
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,540
Okay.

184
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,380
If you have anything else to add,

185
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,580
you can come to tell me.

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,380
I just want to know.

187
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,140
Who took this photo?

188
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,940
We're not sure just yet.

189
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,540
Dad,

190
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,220
are you keeping something from me?

191
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
Do you remember the river
we used to go to

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,580
when you were younger?

193
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,060
There's a high wall
under the arch of the bridge.

194
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,580
When you were younger,

195
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,060
you loved climbing on it.

196
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,980
In the future, if there's something,

197
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,740
go there and find under the bridge.

198
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,540
Find what?

199
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,980
I left you a letter.

200
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
You're back, Officer Lin.

201
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,740
Sir.

202
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,420
Chen.

203
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,980
Over at ECU,

204
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,740
they did a thorough check
on all the accounts of Xu Yi's company.

205
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,220
Then, they also found the source

206
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,940
of the substandard materials.

207
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
Also, the company that opened

208
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,100
in the name

209
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,980
of Xu Jian's wife's cousin's husband

210
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,260
is not as simple as it seems.

211
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,060
Liu Changshui had been receiving
regular paychecks from it.

212
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,820
And the accounts
were clearly tampered with.

213
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
It's really hard to find
where the money went.

214
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,700
So, where's the money?

215
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,420
It's not at the house

216
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,820
or with Liu Changshui.

217
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,100
It just disappeared?

218
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Yeah.

219
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,020
More than 3 million RMB disappeared
without a trace.

220
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,540
So, the ECU suspects

221
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
that the person who burned the car

222
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,260
and the one who broke
into Xu Yi's secret residence

223
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,540
should be the same one.

224
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,060
The motive was to destroy the evidence.

225
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,940
Let's say Xu Jian had taken the money.

226
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,380
In that case, is it possible

227
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,020
that Xu Jian and Xu Yi had conspired

228
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,780
to kill Liu Changshui?

229
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
Xu Yi is dead.

230
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,340
You look pretty happy, huh?

231
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,980
Why would his death

232
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,500
make me feel happy?

233
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,100
You were supposed to hate him.

234
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,900
He kept taking advantage of you

235
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,260
and looked down on you.

236
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,980
He ruined your reputation.

237
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,300
Didn't you hate him?

238
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,380
Yes, I did hate him.

239
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,300
But I didn't hate him that much.

240
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,340
We're cousins, after all.

241
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,340
Right.

242
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,940
You two cousins

243
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,420
did business together,

244
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,140
split the money together

245
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,100
and also murdered together.

246
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,060
I murdered nobody.

247
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,140
Come on, stop saying that.

248
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,100
Was it the body
that was salvaged from the river?

249
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,620
Who did he kill?

250
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,780
I swear I didn't kill anyone with them.

251
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,540
Take a look.

252
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,340
Looks familiar?

253
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,540
Do you know him?

254
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,380
I...

255
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,180
How am I supposed to know?

256
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,940
Take a look at this one.

257
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,700
Don't you think

258
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,100
the clothes worn by the people

259
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
in the photos look similar?

260
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,420
Look carefully.

261
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,540
He...

262
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,660
killed Liu Changshui?

263
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,380
You should know that better than we do.

264
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,580
I don't know.

265
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,900
I'm just a small fry,

266
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,060
a lackey.

267
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm not involved
in any of that kind of business.

268
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,820
I'm warning you.

269
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,620
You'd better not

270
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,860
try to play petty tricks.

271
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,260
Oftentimes, those who play petty tricks
are the ones to die.

272
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,380
All right.

273
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,980
Let me analyze
the current situation for you.

274
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,500
The bridge case,

275
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,180
Liu Changshui's case

276
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,180
and Xu Yi's case

277
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,660
are all related to you.

278
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,340
Three cases,

279
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,100
four deaths.

280
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,900
The amount involved is tens of millions.

281
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,780
Do you know how much

282
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,140
manpower and resources
the provincial office will assign

283
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,780
to investigate such big
and serious cases

284
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,660
like these?

285
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,420
You think the police are incompetent?

286
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,260
That such a large force would be unable
to find out problems with your accounts,

287
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,420
find your fingerprints and shoe prints,

288
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,260
or the tiniest mistakes you've made?

289
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,620
Xu Jian,

290
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,340
did you think we would've called you in

291
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,140
if we hadn't grasped the situation
and compiled evidence

292
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,580
just to drink tea and chat with you?

293
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,540
Since Xu Yi is dead,

294
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,420
you probably think
there's no evidence, right?

295
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,500
So, all you have to do
is dump everything

296
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,260
on him.

297
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,700
Think carefully.

298
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
Is there any person,

299
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,100
whether accidental, hidden, or intimate,

300
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,820
who might have known or seen something?

301
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,140
Any details

302
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,220
that you've forgotten about?

303
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,300
Finding clues

304
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,540
and making painstaking investigations.

305
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,340
Those are what we do.

306
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,900
We've handled plenty of cases.

307
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,860
Yours

308
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,900
aren't even a big deal.

309
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,780
Make a voluntary confession,

310
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,220
or let us do it for you.

311
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,140
Think carefully about it
before making your choice.

312
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,100
How about this?

313
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,300
Let's start with the easy one.

314
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,380
Tell us

315
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,740
about the bridge construction.

316
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,060
How did you, Xu Yi,

317
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,100
and Liu Changshui

318
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,140
split the money?

319
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,340
Xu Yi got 60 percent.

320
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,100
Liu Changshui and I got 20 percent each.

321
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,900
How was the work divided?

322
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,740
It was his project.

323
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,780
I got the contract.

324
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,100
My company handled the bookkeeping.

325
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,740
Then, I was in charge

326
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,620
of the construction team.

327
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,500
Liu Changshui was in charge
of procurement.

328
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,100
Up till now,

329
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,940
how much money have you taken?

330
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,340
None at all.

331
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,740
All right.

332
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,580
You

333
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,500
can sit and wait for your sentencing.

334
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,580
Wait!

335
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,500
I really didn't get any money.

336
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,740
Otherwise, why did I

337
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,980
go to his house
on New Year's Night?

338
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,980
After the money was paid,

339
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,060
he put it all in his own pocket.

340
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,340
I didn't even see it.

341
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,580
As for the pension

342
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,540
he promised me,

343
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,860
he didn't give it to me.

344
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm telling you the truth!

345
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,940
It's true!

346
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,860
Right after the incident,

347
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,060
Xu Yi called me
to the restaurant to have a talk.

348
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
No need to be afraid.

349
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,180
We'll just have to find a solution
to the problem.

350
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,060
Xu Yi is resourceful.

351
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,820
You've still got the nerve
to eat, scoundrel.

352
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,420
What kind of idiots did you hire?

353
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Setting up camp
under the bridge at night.

354
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,340
Don't you have any common sense?

355
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Now such a serious accident
has happened.

356
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,900
What do we do?

357
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,420
There were some problems

358
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,540
with the materials.

359
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,300
But if the construction team
had followed the plan,

360
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,540
it wouldn't have collapsed so quickly.

361
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,020
Did you modify the blueprint?

362
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,300
How would I do that?

363
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,820
It was the foreman.

364
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,900
When he saw the blueprint,

365
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,860
he said it'd take

366
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,940
at least two months
to complete the design.

367
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,820
Xu Jian, are you insane?

368
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,780
You found a toilet builder
to build a bridge?

369
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,820
If he were that skilled,

370
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,540
why bother working for you?

371
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,260
Well...

372
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,260
The architect you hired
to draw the blueprint

373
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,700
did a shoddy job.

374
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,140
How do you expect to construct

375
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,300
when the numbers don't even match?

376
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
If it's wrong, then get him to fix it.

377
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,380
Now, the incident has already happened.

378
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,980
What's the point in saying that?

379
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,460
If the authorities
investigate the matter,

380
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,620
they will definitely
investigate the materials.

381
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,380
I...

382
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,540
Does that mean I'm screwed?

383
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,020
Well.

384
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,780
Xu Yi.

385
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,820
Xu Yi.

386
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,460
Do something,

387
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,060
okay?

388
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,300
Spend some money to settle this matter.

389
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,300
You make it sound easy.

390
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,460
I mean, you have reliable connections.

391
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:27,900
Get someone to help us.

392
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,220
You think I haven't been trying?

393
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,460
I've gone to everyone I could think of.

394
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,780
Everyone is avoiding me

395
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,540
and refusing to see me.

396
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,900
Now, the matter has gotten out of hand.

397
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,700
Who would like to get involved?

398
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,700
All right, all right.

399
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,700
Stop arguing.

400
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,300
Sir, listen.

401
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,780
Just give me my money,

402
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,420
okay?

403
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,260
I have to hide for a while.

404
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,420
Money?

405
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,860
Money from where?

406
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,660
You think there's a money tree?

407
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,900
Now, the incident caused two dead
and three injured.

408
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,300
They're in the hospital every day,
so money is being spent quickly.

409
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,980
If I don't give them more pensions,

410
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,420
they will sue me.

411
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
You think I don't have enough

412
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,820
lawsuits as it is?

413
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,780
Listen up.

414
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,020
The money we make

415
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,380
isn't even enough to deal with this.

416
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,300
What's the point

417
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,420
of telling me this now?

418
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,780
The accident has happened.

419
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
The materials were handled by me.

420
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,660
I was the one who found the architect.

421
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
What now?

422
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,860
I don't get any money,

423
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,060
and I'll have to go to jail.

424
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Fine.

425
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,180
If the police come to me,

426
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,220
I'll tell them what I know.

427
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,700
Darn you. Go on, tell them!

428
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,380
Tell them.

429
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,580
Should I get you a loudspeaker?

430
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,260
You listen.

431
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
I have nothing to do with your company.

432
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,700
Even if you die,
it has nothing to do with me.

433
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,020
Liu has a lot
of responsibilities to bear.

434
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,660
You scoundrel.

435
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,820
All right, stop it!

436
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,460
Xu Yi!

437
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,860
Go to hell, you scoundrel.

438
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,180
Let's sit down.

439
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,940
Go away!

440
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,340
Stop arguing.

441
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,700
It won't solve the problem.

442
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
We have to think about
how to deal with the money first.

443
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,460
Okay.

444
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,620
After deducting the workers'
hospitalization and pension,

445
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,940
I'll give you 30 percent.

446
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,020
Your son is going to university, right?

447
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,580
You go to jail,

448
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,460
and I'll take care

449
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,260
of his living and studies expenses.

450
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:10,980
Liu.

451
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,580
Thirty percent.

452
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,540
That's good enough.

453
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,660
Think about it.

454
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,300
You might not even make
that amount in ten years.

455
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,180
It's fine if you don't agree.

456
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,260
Go ahead and tell others.

457
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,700
Tell whoever you want.

458
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,580
Or you could run.

459
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,900
The police will catch you
sooner or later.

460
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
Isn't it better

461
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,620
to turn yourself in

462
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,260
and leave some money
for your wife and son?

463
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,340
Just think about it carefully.

464
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,420
Well?

465
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,660
Make a smart choice.

466
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,780
Forty percent.

467
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Forty percent.

468
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,660
Think about it.

469
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,540
Forty percent, okay?

470
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay.

471
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,620
Forty percent it is.

472
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,540
All right.

473
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
That's settled, then.

474
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,460
Come on.

475
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,780
I'll fill the cup for you.

476
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,820
Let's drink to that.

477
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:56,780
Come on.

478
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Come on, Liu.

479
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,180
It's all settled, then.

480
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,620
Come on.

481
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,420
I need to think about it some more.

482
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,220
Darn you!

483
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,140
You still need to think?

484
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,180
Get over here!

485
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,620
Let him think.

486
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,900
Come here. I'll kill you right now.

487
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,420
You scoundrel!

488
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,980
Forty percent,
and you still want to think?

489
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,540
Let him think. Calm down!

490
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,620
We're discussing a deal.

491
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,980
Take it slow.

492
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,740
Let him think about it.

493
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,140
You're not a good person too!

494
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,820
You listen up.

495
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,380
It's your fault all this happened.

496
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,860
Me? What did I do?

497
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,540
Get out!

498
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,860
Stop it!

499
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,220
Get out!

500
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,020
What's wrong with you?

501
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,060
Listen up...

502
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,780
Go away!

503
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,300
Come in.

504
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,180
That scoundrel, Liu Changshui.

505
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,940
He really pushed his luck.

506
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,900
How much does he want?

507
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,220
He wants half of it.

508
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,100
Half?

509
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,300
If he wants half of it,
how much can we get then?

510
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,580
He wants half of the total price.

511
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,020
We'll still need to pay
for the compensation and consolation.

512
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,660
Is he crazy?

513
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,260
That scoundrel is dead set on it.

514
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,260
He said if he doesn't get the money,

515
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,660
he'll expose whatever he knows.

516
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,060
That ungrateful mutt.

517
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,780
I'll kill him!

518
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,780
What about this?

519
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,780
Hand over your share.

520
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
I'll make up the rest.

521
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,940
Anyway,

522
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
we can still make money
after this is over.

523
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,740
My share?

524
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,780
How am I supposed to give him money?

525
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,060
My company is also in a tight spot.

526
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,020
You can pay him out of your own pocket.

527
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
I don't have any money.

528
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,300
Xu Jian,

529
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,180
you scoundrel,

530
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,780
so now, you're showing me an attitude?

531
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,180
Think it carefully.

532
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,260
How am I involved in this?

533
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,660
I am just a subcontractor.

534
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,620
As for materials and construction work,

535
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,300
neither of those
has anything to do with me.

536
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,780
Why should I solve the problems

537
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,540
for you two?

538
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,820
Don't give me that crap.

539
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,820
If this has nothing to do with you,

540
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,260
why do you agree to let him have half?

541
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,140
Am I right?

542
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,660
Listen up, Xu Yi.

543
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,580
We are cousins.

544
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,060
If you want to get rid of me,

545
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,940
let's see who else you can trust.

546
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,100
Fine.

547
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,260
We can discuss
how to split the money later.

548
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,340
First, go and deal with Liu Changshui.

549
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,140
Later, I went to Liu Changshui's house
to have a talk.

550
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,260
He suddenly changed his mind.

551
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,660
He didn't agree to just 50 percent.

552
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,620
He wanted an additional house.

553
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,900
When Xu Yi heard that, he was irritated.

554
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,540
He wanted him dead.

555
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,620
When Liu Changshui got wind of it,

556
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,220
he took the ledger and hid.

557
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,660
On and off, he'd call and threaten him,

558
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
saying if he didn't get the money,

559
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,260
he'd go down together with him.

560
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,660
Xu Yi said it was in for a penny,
in for a pound.

561
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,380
So he accused him
of absconding with the money.

562
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,620
He could just hide the money.
It's cash anyway.

563
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,660
No one can say for sure
who it belongs to.

564
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,180
But the ledger is with Liu Changshui.

565
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,540
At last, Liu Changshui refused

566
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,820
to give back the ledger.

567
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,460
And so, you killed him
together with Xu Yi.

568
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,620
I really didn't know
he killed Liu Changshui.

569
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,700
You didn't know?

570
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,820
This photo you took

571
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,260
was the last time
Liu Changshui showed up.

572
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,020
After that day,

573
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,820
it was like he disappeared
into thin air.

574
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,100
I didn't take that photo.

575
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,780
Who did then?

576
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,980
I stole it

577
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,820
from Xu Yi's house.

578
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,060
You were the one who secretly broke

579
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,220
into his house?

580
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,980
When did you go in there?

581
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,100
What did you do?

582
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,420
I went there the day after Xu Yi died.

583
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,700
I was afraid you guys would
go there to investigate.

584
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,380
So, I tried to figure out
if there was something there.

585
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,980
But I didn't find anything.

586
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,380
I only found a few photos

587
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,780
in the safe box.

588
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,580
How did you know the passcode
to the safe box?

589
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,700
I didn't know.

590
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,180
I have a friend who used to do that.

591
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,460
He loves unlocking safe boxes.

592
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,460
What about the ledger?

593
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,860
What's up with that?

594
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,940
I was the one who left it there.

595
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,340
You were pretty thorough.

596
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,900
I thought, if there weren't a ledger,

597
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,860
you people would investigate
following the clue.

598
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,180
But if there were a ledger
in the safe box,

599
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,460
then I'd be cleared of suspicion.

600
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,980
The real ledger and the money.

601
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,460
Where are they?

602
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,420
I don't know.

603
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,740
Maybe they were in the car
that was burned.

604
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,340
So that's why you burned the car.

605
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,700
I did not burn the car.

606
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,580
Who did it, then?

607
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,180
Chen Ling did it.

608
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,620
Don't... Don't look at me like that.

609
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,700
I saw it, really.

610
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,940
[Millennium Night (December 31, 1999)]

611
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,180
Why are you here?

612
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,980
It's New Year,

613
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,020
so I came to visit.

614
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:54,700
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

615
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,660
Stop talking nonsense!

616
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,220
Why would Chen Ling burn his car?

617
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,100
I don't know.

618
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,980
Go ask her.

619
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,540
Chen,

620
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,380
sit down.

621
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,140
Let me ask you.

622
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,180
On the night of the millennium,

623
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,460
why did you climb over Xu Yi's fence?

624
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,420
To steal the ledger.

625
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,660
Why?

626
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,980
So I could ask Xu Yi for money.

627
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,740
Xu Yi said he gave all the money
to Liu Changshui.

628
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,340
But I didn't even know
where Liu Changshui was.

629
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,380
How would I find him?

630
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,980
So, did you find the ledger?

631
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,700
No.

632
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,820
I just got in

633
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,980
when the two came back.

634
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,820
They were fighting.

635
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
That's it?

636
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,180
Yes, that's it.

637
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,060
I didn't want to get found,

638
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,060
so I quietly left.

639
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,500
Halfway through,

640
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,860
I saw Xu Yi's car.

641
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,180
I thought then, since he

642
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,420
was usually very careful,

643
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,420
he might have left the stuff in the car.

644
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,940
So I wanted to look for something
to pry the door open.

645
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,860
But before I could do it,
Chen Ling showed up

646
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,460
and swiftly set the car on fire.

647
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,540
This is the police station.
Have Chen Ling answer the call.

648
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,780
Was it you who burned Xu Yi's car?

649
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

650
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,100
Come to the station immediately!

651
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,900
Whatever it is,

652
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,100
ask away.

653
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,860
I was the one who burned the car.

654
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,900
I admit it.

655
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,740
Why did you burn the car?

656
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,540
I hate him.

657
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,300
Weren't you going to marry him?

658
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,060
He didn't mean it.

659
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,660
He only agreed to brush me off.

660
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,340
Actually,

661
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,940
he had already planned to run away.

662
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,620
If you don't sign it,

663
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,820
then just wait to be sentenced.

664
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,700
That day, Xu Yi had initially agreed

665
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,980
to divorce Nan Ya.

666
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,940
But they started arguing again
at the riverside.

667
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,740
I worried things weren't going
as planned.

668
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,300
I thought it was better
for the three of us to talk it out.

669
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,020
So, I decided to go
to Xu Yi's house.

670
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,940
You want a divorce?

671
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,780
In your dreams.

672
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,820
Even if I were to be sent
to the hell,

673
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,860
I'd be taking you with me.

674
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,180
Xu Yi!

675
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Xu Yi, come out!

676
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,140
Xu Yi!

677
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,100
Open the door, Xu Yi!

678
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,620
Xu Yi!

679
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,020
What are you doing here?

680
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,980
What were you two arguing about?

681
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,580
You've heard all of it, right?

682
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,620
Didn't you say
you would divorce her this afternoon?

683
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,580
Is getting a divorce

684
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,620
that easy?

685
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,380
Why isn't it?

686
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,140
I'm really annoyed right now.

687
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,220
Can you leave for now?

688
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,100
No.

689
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,860
Let me in.

690
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Nan Ya, come down!

691
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,060
Get out of here!

692
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,020
Leave!

693
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,860
I can't believe I was so stupid.

694
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,900
From start to end,
It was all between the two of them.

695
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,580
One loved, and the other didn't.

696
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,420
One wanted to divorce,
and the other wouldn't agree.

697
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,980
Why must I be the supporting role

698
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,260
to set off their feelings?

699
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,860
Who am I to them?

700
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,700
So you didn't see

701
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,820
what happened.

702
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,700
Then, why are you so sure

703
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,300
that Nan Ya killed him?

704
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,260
Who would be the happiest one

705
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,060
for his death?

706
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,900
What about you?

707
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,700
Don't you hate him?

708
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
Yes, I hate him.

709
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,940
But I never wished him dead.

710
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,740
Then, have you ever been

711
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,420
to the house Xu Yi rented in town?

712
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,420
I knew

713
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,260
the police would find
that place eventually.

714
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,820
So I went to clear my things

715
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,180
from the house.

716
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,140
Aside from Nan Ya,

717
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,860
no one else knew about Xu Yi and me.

718
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,860
I know Nan Ya wouldn't divulge it.

719
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,860
Why?

720
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,260
She said

721
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,340
she owed me.

722
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,620
So, because she owed you,

723
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,300
you were then sure

724
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,180
that she murdered him, yeah?

725
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,060
I don't get it.

726
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,260
Ever since that day,

727
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,580
it has kept me
tossing and turning every day.

728
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,780
Why on earth did Xu Yi

729
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,100
go after Nan Ya with an axe?

730
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,340
That afternoon, when we ate together,

731
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,300
he was still fine.

732
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,580
What reason did he have to kill her?

733
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Could it be that Nan Ya
had some incriminating dirt

734
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,860
on Xu Yi?

735
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,180
Thus, he tried to kill her.

736
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,580
Xu Yi wasn't that evil.

737
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,700
He was just moody.

738
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,460
And he didn't sleep well.

739
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,620
But that was all because of Nan Ya.

740
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,020
She had him wrapped around her finger.

741
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
He already bought tickets
to leave the next day.

742
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,420
Why would he kill her, then?

743
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,140
Chen Ling.

744
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,260
One of them is dead,

745
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,340
and the other is going to jail.

746
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,140
Even so, they're getting me
in this mess.

747
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,780
What did I ever do wrong?

748
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,740
That I have to be
the town's laughing stock?

749
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,420
Let me tell you this.

750
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,860
Xu Yi is the prime suspect

751
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,380
for at least two homicides.

752
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,900
What?

753
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
Homicides?

754
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,940
You mean he killed someone?

755
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,780
No way.

756
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,220
Go to hell.

757
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,140
Zhou Luo.

758
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,460
