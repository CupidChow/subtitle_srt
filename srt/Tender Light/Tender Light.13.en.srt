So when you woke up,

6
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,980
he had already pushed Hu Lifan
into the lake,

7
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,860
is that it?

8
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,620
I presumed so.

9
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,420
You didn't ask him?

10
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,820
No.

11
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,140
Why didn't you?

12
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,540
I was afraid to be proven correct.

13
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,900
So, you were saying

14
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,780
it was Xu Yi who killed Hu Lifan.

15
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,060
And you weren't involved
from start to finish.

16
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,460
Wasn't I?

17
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,540
If it had nothing to do with me,

18
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,620
then why did Hu Lifan die?

19
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,980
Did you kill Hu Lifan or not?

20
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,820
I didn't kill him.

21
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,020
But I wanted him dead.

22
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,300
I wished he'd die 100 times over!

23
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,340
This place has long been abandoned.

24
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,940
No one wants to come here.

25

his ribs were fractured.

29
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,100
He must have been beaten
by Jiang Baoshan and the gang.

30
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,340
So Xu Yi was trying to kill Hu Lifan

31

who was physically strong and agile

32
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,820

a rag was found.

45
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,340
It was probably torn off
from the clothing.

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,700
of the hardships you had suffered before

193
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,980
and the subsequent repercussions
you'll receive.

194
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,940
You'll never be happy!

195
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,380
He purposely called Chen Ling to come

196
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,300
so that she'd find out

197
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,940
you two were together

198
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,780
that night.

199
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,660
So, why didn't you

200
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,940
go to the police the next day?

201
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,420
At the time, I didn't have any way

202
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,500
to ascertain whether or not
he killed Hu Lifan.

203
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,340
If I was able to verify what I thought,

204
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,540
it still meant
Xu Yi had killed Hu Lifan for me.

205
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,940
You're asking me to report him?

206
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,180
I couldn't do it.

207
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,180
After you got married to him,

208
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,580
you were subjected to constant abuse.

209
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,860
You could have freed yourself

210
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,260
if you had just gone to the police.

211
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,380
Every time he hit me,

212
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,900
I thought that it was what I deserved.

213
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,980
Because ever since that night,

214
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,540
we were destined to live a dark life.

215
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,420
That was the price.

216
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,620
She was pregnant before getting married.

217
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,540
You dare bring such a woman back?

218
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,580
You must have been possessed by her.

219
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,060
You could live a good and proper life.

220
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,540
But you would rather choose this wench?

221
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,740
You don't mind losing face, but I do!

222
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,500
If you dare to marry her,

223
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,260
then never come back!

224
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Just leave them there.

225
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,460
Let's go.

226
00:19:52,820 --> 00:20:03,070
[Yishan Civil Affairs Bureau]

227
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,900
Later, when I thought about it...

228
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,540
Come on.

229
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,060
I found it impossible for one person
to bear the secret of killing someone.

230
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,740
Since then,

231
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,820
Xu Yi became violent,

232
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,980
selfish, skeptical

233
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,460
and temperamental.

234
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,620
What's the matter?

235
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,780
Who did you speak with out there today?

236
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,940
Who did I talk to?

237
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,020
I just went out to buy some food.

238
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,060
Buy food?

239
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,060
Did buying food include
flirting with Lai

240
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,020
at the cigarette and alcohol stall?

241
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,580
Who was flirting?

242
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,860
That's what the people are saying.

243
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,940
Nan Ya.

244
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Tell me the truth.

245
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,900
Who else did you sleep with

246
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,900
aside from Hu Lifan?

247
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,140
What is that look supposed to mean?

248
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,620
Hu Lifan wasn't lying.

249
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,060
That night when you were with me,

250
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,820
I knew that something was wrong.

251
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,900
I've explained this countless times.

252
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,820
No.

253
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm sure
you're hiding something from me.

254
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
That night,

255
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,300
you told me clearly

256
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,100
that you didn't like me.

257
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,700
Who do you like, then?

258
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,700
I don't like anyone.

259
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,540
But you said it yourself.

260
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,980
I only said it so you'd give up.

261
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,820
Why did you want me to give up?

262
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,700
Yeah.

263
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,340
Because from beginning to end,

264
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,980
you never had

265
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
any feelings for me, right?

266
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,740
For you,

267
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,540
I lost everything.

268
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,500
For you, I was kicked out
by my family.

269
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,060
For you,

270
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,620
I... I did things I never would have.

271
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,020
I did them all!

272
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,140
What about you?

273
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,660
After so long,

274
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,500
you still don't even
have any feelings for me.

275
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,180
And you even flirt with men outside.

276
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,060
I don't want to talk to you.

277
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,340
Get over here!

278
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,940
Who said you could go?

279
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,060
It hurts...

280
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Wanwan was born prematurely
because of that kick.

281
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,140
When she was born,

282
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,580
she had congenital renal insufficiency.

283
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,540
Xu Yi didn't let me talk
to any other men.

284
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,980
If he was unsatisfied,

285
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,260
he'd give me a beating.

286
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,140
But later, he'd beg for my forgiveness.

287
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,780
He was like a different man
in those days.

288
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,060
Gentle and considerate.

289
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,580
Utterly romantic.

290
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,980
Every night, he'd whisper in my ear.

291
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,060
It was because of me

292
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,540
that his life turned out like this.

293
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,620
If I dared betray him,

294
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,700
he'd kill me and Wanwan.

295
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,660
Why didn't you report him, Nan Ya?

296
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,540
You think I didn't want to?

297
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,540
I kept thinking about it
when I was in the delivery room.

298
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,340
But what could I do?

299
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,860
Wanwan was still so young.

300
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,340
I needed a lot of money
to treat her illness.

301
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,380
Where would I find the money
if I left him?

302
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,660
Then what was it that made you
finally decide

303
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,380
to divorce Xu Yi?

304
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,300
Wanwan is bigger now.

305
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,380
I don't want our tragedy

306
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,540
to continue on her.

307
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,220
So it had nothing to do

308
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,860
with what happened at the train station?

309
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,100
Before the train station incident,
I thought I owed him.

310
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,140
After that, I felt

311
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,700
that I had cleared everything
I owed him.

312
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,460
I was determined to divorce him.

313
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,620
How much did you know
about the bridge case?

314
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,980
I don't have any solid evidence.

315
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,860
Only a few photos.

316
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,940
That night,

317
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,020
I used Hu Lifan to threaten Xu Yi
for a divorce.

318
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,420
Xu Yi then went berserk
and wanted to kill me.

319
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
I don't know

320
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,660
why he became like that.

321
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,300
Because in that remote lake,

322
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,660
there was another body.

323
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,060
Liu Changshui's.

324
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,420
Why didn't you tell the truth
in the first place?

325
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,220
Now that we've traced it back to you,

326
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,820
you change your story.

327
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,740
Because I'm afraid.

328
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm afraid that Hu Lifan's case
would implicate me.

329
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,780
Then I'll have to go to jail,

330
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,980
and Wanwan will be an orphan.

331
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,060
We've done an autopsy on the body.

332
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,380
In Liu Changshui's nails,

333
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,020
we found Xu Yi's DNA.

334
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,340
We believe Liu Changshui
was hit by a blunt object,

335
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,460
most likely a shovel,

336
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,940
on the back of the head,
causing craniocerebral injury.

337
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,540
Then he was tied to a huge rock

338
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,580
and drowned in the lake.

339
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,780
The way the body was dealt with

340
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,980
is the same in Hu Lifan's case.

341
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,300
So we can safely conclude

342
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,740
that it was Xu Yi who killed him.

343
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,300
Could you guys release
a public statement?

344
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,940
Or publish it in the newspaper.

345
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,500
Tell them

346
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,020
that my dad hadn't absconded
with the money.

347
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,380
The bridge case is still ongoing.

348
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,580
Whether he had absconded with the money

349
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
or was involved in it

350
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,500
is still being investigated.

351
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,020
So we're unable to make a statement now.

352
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,900
He had been killed by Xu Yi!

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,580
How could he abscond with the money?

354
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,180
Where's the money?

355
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,900
Is it in the lake?

356
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,020
Here's the thing.

357
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,860
When the case is wrapped up,

358
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
if

359
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,740
we found that your father was innocent,

360
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,860
we would definitely clear his name.

361
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,180
Clear his name?

362
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,980
How?

363
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,620
Publish it in the newspaper?

364
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,060
Or monetary compensation?

365
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,820
Because the suspect is now dead

366
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,980
and his assets have been frozen,

367
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,860
so...

368
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,540
What about Nan Ya?

369
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,980
Nan Ya should compensate
on behalf of Xu Yi, no?

370
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,060
Xu Yi

371
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,860
deliberately left

372
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,700
pieces of Hu Lifan's
bloodstained clothing

373
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
in the trashcan
by the door of the boiler room.

374
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,900
And the trashcan

375
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,700
gets cleaned every day.

376
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,540
With that, it helped the police confirm

377
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,700
that the missing Hu Lifan was dead.

378
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,220
As for the time of death,

379
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,060
it could only be the night before.

380
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,380
Only then,

381
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,940
could

382
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,900
his carefully planned alibi

383
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,780
be of actual use.

384
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,020
The autopsy report

385
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,340
is consistent with Nan Ya's statement.

386
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,500
Hu Lifan died due to blunt force trauma
to the head.

387
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,860
From the severity of his broken bones,

388
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,940
the perpetrator was most likely
someone much stronger.

389
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,380
So that basically rules out

390
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,740
Nan Ya as the killer.

391
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,740
But she confessed

392
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,060
that she didn't actually see
Xu Yi kill him.

393
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,580
But whether or not she was an accomplice
in hiding the body

394
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,140
or covering the matter up

395
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,540
remains

396
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,620
unknown.

397
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,100
The media attention

398
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,180
has turned this case

399
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
into a social event.

400
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,340
Earlier today,

401
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,900
the Provincial PSB's Deputy Director
had personally called.

402
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,900
He said,

403
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,500
for women like Nan Ya, who are victims
of long-term domestic abuse

404
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,380
as well as sexual harassment,

405
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,060
we should give more consideration

406
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,980
to their predicament.

407
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,500
As long as it is eligible

408
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,900
to be justified in self-defense,

409
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,220
there's no need to be overly cautious.

410
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,420
We can't assume it's difficult
to make such a decision

411
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,500
just because someone's dead.

412
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,900
And we can't push
an "excessive defense" onto her

413
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,860
to make ourselves feel better.

414
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,980
Since there is such a concept in law,

415
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,900
I don't think

416
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,380
we should make it a piece of empty talk.

417
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:07,860
Right?

418
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,660
Whether or not Nan Ya
has any responsibility

419
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,980
in covering up Hu Lifan's case,

420
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,060
in terms of the justified
self-defense claim against Xu Yi,

421
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,260
her reasons and evidence

422
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,540
are sound.

423
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,740
Thus, I've already submitted
the request.

424
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,740
As for the possibility of covering up,

425
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,060
this is what I think.

426
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,660
Now,

427
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,580
she did not witness the crime itself

428
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,820
so she was unaware.

429
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,260
Since she was unaware,

430
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,020
we should follow the principle of
presumption of innocence.

431
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,860
Am I right?

432
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,540
None of our assumptions and conjectures

433
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,700
has any legal basis.

434
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,260
My comrades.

435
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,780
Whatever it is,

436
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
Hu Lifan's case

437
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,500
is finally resolved after five years.

438
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,580
This is a good news.

439
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,940
It should be given praise.

440
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,540
Chen.

441
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Now you can finally
get over it, right?

442
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,820
I'm glad you get over it.

443
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,580
All right.

444
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,140
That's all for the meeting today.

445
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,060
Dismissed.

446
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,700
Thanks, sir.

447
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,420
Five years.

448
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,660
It wasn't easy.

449
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,940
The case is resolved.

450
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,100
Why are you still looking gloomy?

451
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,700
You're not exactly
jumping for joy either.

452
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,700
Don't you think

453
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,860
that Xu Yi and Hu Lifan's deaths

454
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,580
are pretty similar.

455
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,900
What do you mean?

456
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,740
Both of them are dead.

457
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,580
And the biggest beneficiary is Nan Ya.

458
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,020
But she managed to completely
wash her hands clean.

459
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,820
What about Zhou Luo's testimony?

460
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,060
Are you saying it was pre-planned?

461
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,740
That's what I can't figure out.

462
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,140
I'm planning to go to Shanghai.

463
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,580
To find out the real reason
why Zhou Luo dropped out.

464
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,460
I think it has to do
with the woman in the photo.

465
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,420
There's one thing.

466
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,980
I've been keeping it from you.

467
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,500
After much thought,

468
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,380
I think it's better to tell you.

469
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,020
Xu Yi's secret lover.

470
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,340
It was Chen Ling.

471
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,660
When did Ling

472
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,500
get home that day?

473
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,420
Which day?

474
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,340
The day Xu Yi died.

475
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,220
She didn't come home that night,

476
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,380
but the next morning.

477
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,100
What time in the morning?

478
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,020
Probably past 7?

479
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,020
How did she look when she got back?

480
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
I told her Xu Yi had been killed.

481
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
She was pretty shocked

482
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,860
and upset.

483
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,540
Jun!

484
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,340
Come out and eat.

485
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,380
You better eat

486
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,340
before you are late!

487
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,740
You're back.

488
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,620
You heard?

489
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,580
Heard what?

490
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,540
You didn't know Xu Yi was dead?

491
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Xu Yi is dead.

492
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,180
Nan Ya killed him.

493
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,100
Dad was told to go to his place
in the middle of the night.

494
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,940
What did you say?

495
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,140
Xu Yi is dead.

496
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,140
Ling.

497
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:16,660
Ling.

498
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,620
Take a good rest.

499
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,700
Ling.

500
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,500
Let it go.

501
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,460
From now on,

502
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,700
just let him disappear

503
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,060
from your heart completely.

504
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,060
All right?

505
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,860
Forget him.

506
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,020
Ling.

507
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,340
I know you've suffered a lot
over the years.

508
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,540
I felt bad for what happened

509
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,740
between you and Xu Yi, too.

510
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,220
He's gone now.

511
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,940
Please don't torture yourself anymore.

512
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,940
Okay?

513
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,620
That Xu Yi.

514
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,860
I really hate him!

515
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,180
Look how much our daughter had suffered
because of him.

516
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
How can she work at the hospital now?

517
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,820
My goodness.

518
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,420
Where is she?

519
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,140
She's working the night shift.

520
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,660
Tell her to resign.

521
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,140
Easy for you to say.

522
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,500
She's not married.

523
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,980
Without a job,

524
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,740
how will she survive?

525
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,020
I'm not done washing.

526
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,300
What are you doing?

527
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm going to the hospital.

528
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
No, you're not!

529
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,380
Ling's not home

530
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,100
because she's avoiding you.

531
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,780
She's really heartbroken.

532
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,660
Just give her some space, will you?

533
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,860
This is unbelievable.

534
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,180
What kind of father are you?

535
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,260
You're only thinking
about handling and investigating cases.

536
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,700
Now you even want
to get your daughter involved.

537
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,540
Are you happy now?

538
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,940
What kind of father

539
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,660
wouldn't protect his own daughter?

540
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,860
So stubborn.

541
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
Good grief.
