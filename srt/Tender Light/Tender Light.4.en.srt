194
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,900
Not only am I good at treating patients,

195
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,860
but I also read palms.

196
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,860
Let me read your palm.

197
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,420
I'm an unlucky person.

198
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,260
There are lots of sayings about this.

199
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,940
Let me pack this up for you.

200
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,580
Okay.

201
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,380
Zhou Luo,

202
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,620
why are you here?

203
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,780
Why can't I be here?

204
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,420
This is a women's clothing store.

205
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Then what are you doing here

206
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,580
in broad daylight?

207
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,980
What?

208
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,820
What are you talking about?

209
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,180
What do you mean by broad daylight?

210
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm Wanwan's attending doctor.

211
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,460
I came here to talk
about the child's illness with Nan Ya

212
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,260
and asked her to help me
hem these trousers.

213
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,300
What's wrong with that?

214
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,820
Dr. Jiang, I didn't say anything.

215
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,700
Why are you nervous?

216
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
You haven't done anything shameful,
have you?

217
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm not nervous at all.

218
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,220
Why would I be nervous?

219
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,220
Kid,

220
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,380
you'd better not think too much

221
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,220
at such a young age.

222
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,020
Dr. Jiang,

223
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,780
I'm doing this for your own good.

224
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,140
Look,

225
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,940
the window is transparent.

226
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,980
Others can see

227
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,820
what you're doing in here.

228
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,820
If you're going to have
a serious conversation,

229
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,580
don't stand so close to her.

230
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,860
Otherwise,

231
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,580
others might think you are...

232
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Anyway, it won't be good for you.

233
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,020
Okay.

234
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,420
Thank you.

235
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,020
Zhou Luo,

236
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,980
you're the zhuangyuan, right?

237
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,220
You haven't graduated from university.

238
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,140
Then why did you come back
and went to cram school?

239
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,220
Being zhuangyuan only once
isn't enough for me.

240
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,580
I just want to take the exam
and be zhuangyuan again.

241
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,820
You're quite stubborn, huh?

242
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,100
You're bragging.

243
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,380
If you fail to be admitted
to an university,

244
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,780
you'll lose your face.

245
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,220
Done.

246
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,660
Thank you.

247
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,740
Take Wanwan to the hospital

248
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,940
so I can give her new prescriptions.

249
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,500
Okay, thank you.

250
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,020
I should be the one saying thank you.

251
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,900
Zhou Luo.

252
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,180
Are you looking for me?

253
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,260
The goods you ordered are here.

254
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,540
My mom told me to deliver it to you.

255
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,540
I've been busy in the shop these days

256
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,660
and didn't have time to pick it up.

257
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,060
Thank you

258
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,780
for delivering it to me.

259
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,660
It's fine. It's not far from here.

260
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,300
No problem.

261
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,700
You must've been busy
studying recently, right?

262
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Time is precious.

263
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,020
It isn't easy to get the highest score
in the exam.

264
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,020
It is hard for the first time,

265
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,660
but it won't be that hard
for the second time.

266
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,020
You're quite arrogant.

267
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,980
You'll soon find out if I'm arrogant

268
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,020
or telling the truth.

269
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,180
What is this?

270
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,740
It's a toy I made for Wanwan.

271
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,540
It's quite interesting.

272
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
That's only half done.

273
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,940
Even so, it looks exquisite.

274
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,140
Did you sew all the clothes
in your shop?

275
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,820
Half of them.

276
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Not all.

277
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,620
Not many people in town buy them.

278
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,900
Most of the customers are outsiders.

279
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,820
They have their own factories

280
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,780
and want to make them
the ready-to-wear clothes in bulk

281
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
for sale.

282
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,420
What's wrong with your clothes?

283
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,140
Take it off.

284
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,020
Let me sew it for you.

285
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,260
Why don't you cover up with this?

286
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,380
Done.

287
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,540
Wait a moment.

288
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,540
It will only take a few minutes.

289
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,340
Hurry.

290
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:32,900
You're going to be late.

291
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,380
The teacher will punish you.

292
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
Wait outside.

293
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,700
It won't take long.

294
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,180
I'm not wearing any clothes,

295
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,300
and I'm just draped in a lady's shawl.

296
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,180
People will laugh at me.

297
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,700
Done. Put it on.

298
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,420
Thank you.

299
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,500
What are you doing?

300
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,220
Go out!

301

302
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,060
Get out!

303
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,660
Get out.

304
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
Stop pretending.

305
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,460
Jiang Zhi has touched your hand.

306
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,980
Was he here to have his clothes sewn
and talk about the illness?

307
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,580
Stop acting innocent.

308
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,740
Did I unbutton

309
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,780
the button on your back?

310
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,180
Or are you blaming me
for having eyes and seeing it?

311
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,260
If you're not licentious,

312
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,100
why would others come to you?

313
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,220
Why?

314
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,420
Am I right?

315
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,340
Don't you have anything to say?

316
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
I've read the poetry collection

317
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,740

318
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,540
from the town library.

319
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,300
In short, anyone
who reads those erotic poems

320
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,660
is

321
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,060
indecent!

322
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,940
No wonder people in town say
you are profligate.

323
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,940
From now on,

324
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,140
I won't talk to you anymore.

325
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,220
It's all your fault!

326
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,380
Why do I wear a torn shirt?

327
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,220
It's all your fault!

328
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,140
Because log64x

329
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,220

equals to 64 to the power of -2/3,

335
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,700
which equals to four
to the power of three in parentheses,

336
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,780
then to the power of -2/3.

337
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,740
It also equal to four
to the power of negative two.

338
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,340
It equals to...

339
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,820
Boring.

340
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,300

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,140
Like what?

380
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,740
For example, give me an explanation,

381
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,100
make things clear

382
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,660
or pour out your heart.

383
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,980
Zhou Luo,

384
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,140
I was your class adviser
for three years.

385
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,420
You are the student
I've had the highest hopes for.

386
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,660
I've seen you became the zhuangyuan

387
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,180
and got admitted
to a prestigious university.

388
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,100
Actually, your language grade

389
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,980
is not the highest,

390
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,940
but I've always been proud of you.

391
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
I still remember when you were filling
out your university application

392
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,380
we had a in-depth conversation

393
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,700
about your future

394
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,860
and academic plans.

395
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
But why this time?

396
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,900
Why did this happen?

397
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,940
You can't use sick leave as an excuse

398
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,020
to give me runaround.

399
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,980
It isn't a big deal.

400
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,940
I'll just take the exam again.

401
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,740
Looks like you still don't want
to talk about it.

402
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,740
University life is not
as I imagined it to be.

403
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,980
No matter

404
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,460
where we go,
we'll always be part of society.

405
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,100
There are lots of things

406
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,700
that we don't understand.

407
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,220
And you just quit

408
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,500
because it wasn't
what you imagined it to be?

409
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,060
I was kicked out by the university.

410
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,060
Why?

411
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
I beat a teacher up,

412
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,580
but I don't regret it.

413
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,140
If you're going to Huashan Cram School,

414
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,700
it means you've figured it out.

415
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,340
Don't talk

416
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,660
about the past anymore.

417
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,980
I won't ask more questions.

418
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,580
Just remember

419
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,670
to make full advantage
of your intelligence.

420
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,540
This one

421
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,580
isn't exactly first rate.

422
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,700
I know you have questions.

423
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,620
You think it's dirty

424
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,340
and vulgar,

425
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,540
right?

426
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,660
That was my first thought.

427
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,340
Looks like

428
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,380
physics cannot satisfy your needs.

429
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,340
The end of one's imagination is poetry.

430
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,300
Everything can be written in poetry.

431
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,780
Like the natural instincts of man
and little nothings of life.

432
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,900
Humans are full of passion.

433
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,700
Medicine, law, science, and business

434
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,900
can be pursued as lifelong careers.

435
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,420
As for poetry,

436
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,860
art,

437
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
beauty,

438
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,380
romance and love,

439
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,820
these are

440
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,940
reasons to stay alive.

441
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,620
Of course,

442
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,580
these words didn't come from me.

443
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,500
Let me introduce you to a movie.

444
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,620
Watch it.

445
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,220
[Dead Poets Society]

446
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:23,220

00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,860
[Women are more distressed
than young ladies]

448
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,630

[Unable to escape
from the coal-like night]

452
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,460
[In the midst of solid ice
and scorching heat]

453
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,360

[Nothingness and emptiness]

463
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,160
[And hunger]

464
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,860
[I know that you exist]

465
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:01,230
[Because you've pictured me]

466
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,260
[I am tall]

[I am clean]

00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,830
[Because you're seeing me

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,130
[You see me with your clear eyes]

471
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,430
[Your thoughts make me wise]

[You're innocent and gentle]

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,600

[But the one dwelling inside]

478
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:07,560
[Will be another person]

479
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:16,520
[Gloomy, obtuse, and grumpy]

480
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,220
Inhale.

481
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,860
Hold it.

482
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,660
Exhale.

483
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,460
Good.

484
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,100
Zhou Luo

485
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,060
didn't say anything
strange recently, did he?

486
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,100
It sounds like
he's holding a grudge against me.

487
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,180
Is Wanwan getting better?

488
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,300
I told you previously

489
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,860
that her illness can only be controlled.

490
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,380
It is irreversible.

491
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,380
Wait until she grows up.

492
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,140
She can get a suitable replacement.

493
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,700
Her father is rich anyway.

494
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,780
I heard from the director

495
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,100
that we recently got a new batch
of highly effective medications.

496
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,540
They work really well,

497
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,060
but we need special approval
from the director.

498
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,660
Do you want me to get you some?

499
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,580
Sure.

500
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,300
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

501
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,220
I'll deliver it to you tonight.

502
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,620
I'll come here to take it tomorrow.

503
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,860
I want to try your cooking.

504
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,940
But I'm more skilled

505
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,180
at using scissors,
thread and needles.

506
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,340
I'll sew clothes for you.

507
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,260
Is it that difficult
to get you to cook for me?

508
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,500
It's hard to get
that special medication.

509
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,820
Dr. Jiang,

510
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,260
over these years, besides favors,

511
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,460
I don't owe you anything else.

512
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,900
You've received

513
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,020
quite a bit of money and gifts.

514
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,300
If you have any other thoughts,

515
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,460
just forget about it.

516
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,860
Otherwise,
your reputation will be ruined.

517
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,460
Let's go and get your medication.

518
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,940
You're overthinking.

519
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,940
Mom, look. Butterfly!

520
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,100
Be careful, Wanwan.

521
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,860
Watch your step.

522
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,780
Wanwan.

523
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,300
Do you like this butterfly?

524
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,540
Yes.

525
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,980
Where did you catch it?

526
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,940
In the mountains.

527
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,820
Here, take it.

528
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,660
I'll catch more for you later.

529
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,660
Take this too.

530
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,700
Wanwan.

531
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,060
Remember I've told you

532
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,660
that you can't
take other people's things.

533
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,700
Let's go.

534
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,220
Umm...

535
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,820
I'm sorry.

536
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,900
I was wrong to say
those things the other day.

537
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,420
And I didn't mean that.

538
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,260
I deliberately took it out on you
because I was angry.

539
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,780
I studied the poems

540
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,820
you mentioned earlier.

541
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,740
I truly am ignorant
when it comes to literature,

542
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,780
so I take back everything
I said earlier.

543
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,420
After handing in the answer sheet
for an exam,

544
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,900
and you realize
you've got the answer wrong,

545
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,300
can you take it back and correct it?

546
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,460
Swords wound the body,
and words wound the heart.

547
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,500
You can't take back

548
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,780
what you've said.

549
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,860
You think you're like
those people in town,

550
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,140
casually expressing

551
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
your opinion.

552
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,820
You don't mean it.

553
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,420
After all, everyone has the right
to speak their mind.

554
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,260
Doing good or evil
is a matter of personal freedom.

555
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,700
Likewise, not forgiving you

556
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,180
is my freedom.

557
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,900
Why?

558
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,540
Are you surprised?

559
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,620
Do you think I'm the kind of person

560
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,820
who doesn't even care

561
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,700
even though I'm hurt badly by others?

562
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,900
No matter how others insult me,
as long as they apologize to me,

563
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,940
I will forgive them
like nothing ever happened?

564
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,340
When I smile at you,

565
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
you say I'm frivolous.

566
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,780
When I'm kind to you,

567
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,860
you say I'm wanton.

568
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:51,980
When I'm sincere to you,

569
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,380
you say I am embarrassing myself.

570
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,740
Now that you've found
I'm not that easygoing,

571
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,100
you think I'm mean

572
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,580
and unreasonable, right?

573
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,060
No.

574
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,820
All of that was said by people in town,

575
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,580
not by me.

576
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,300
People in town
are calling me a loose woman,

577
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,300
so even kids like you

578
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,580
can insult me.

579
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,620
I thought

580
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,700
you were different from them.
