[Tender Light]

13
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,200
Dad, Fanglu is here.

14
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,760
Okay, come in.

15
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll leave you to it.

16
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,800
I heard you don't want
to transfer to a subordinate unit.

17
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,480
I didn't explicitly refuse it.

18
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
I just...

19
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,800
wanted to change the workplace.

20
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,440
Work in that town for two years,

21
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,840
and you'll get a promotion.
That's what your superior meant.

22
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
You don't have a choice.

23
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,640
Besides,

24
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,200
what's wrong

25
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
with that Qingshui Town?

26
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
You are from that town,

27
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,160
aren't you?

28
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
It's a small place

29
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
with people too close to one another,

30
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,760
which makes it hard
to carry out the work.

31
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,200
It's the same

32
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,840
in every town.

33
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,040
Do you have any other reasons?

34
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
No.

35
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,840
Do you still have family

36
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
in Qingshui Town?

37
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,360
No.

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,640
You got admitted
to a prestigious university

39
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,080
after graduating from there years ago.

40
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
That was remarkable.

41
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,320
Then you went to graduate school.

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,040
You've done

43
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160
a great job.

44
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,520
At this point,

45
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,040
just walk your path
in a down-to-earth way.

46
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
At that time, Wenting will
also be graduating with a PhD.

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,520
In my opinion,

48
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
[Qingshui Police Station]
you will make a good family

49
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
and have a bright future.

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,040
Thanks.

51
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,400
See you.

52
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Sir, look.

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,640
Here's the overall layout
of the crime scene.

54
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
Here on the stairs,

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,160
there are signs of a struggle.

56
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
The pillar by the stairs

57
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
has axe marks on it.

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
The victim eventually fell here.

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
Beside him,

60
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,680
there's evidence
of someone slipping here.

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
Go to the scene now and meet Chen.

62
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,280
You two have to collect

63
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
all the material evidence today.

64
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,480
Yes, sir. I'll go now.

65
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,160
Great.

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
Sorry, who are you looking for?

67
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm here for Officer Xu.

68

someone's here for you.

70

Who is that?

71

Greetings, Sir.

72
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,440
You must be
that talented police officer.

73
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Welcome.

74
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,880
Very glad to meet you.
You're really extraordinary

75
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
What a young gentleman.

Let me help you with your luggage.

77
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
If only you could let us know
you were coming,

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
I could have got someone to pick you up.

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,240
The station isn't far away.

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,400
It's convenient
to take a tricycle to get here.

81
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,480
Here.

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,760
Let me introduce you.

83

our new deputy chief.

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,240
Greetings, Officer Lin.

86
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,800
You're seeing a legend here.

87
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
He was the first student

88
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,960
who graduated
from Qingshui No. 1 High School

89
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,400
and got admitted
to a prestigious university.

90
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,240
He's an expert
in criminal investigation.

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,800
If only you had come a day earlier.

92
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,040
We were talking

93
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,640
about holding a welcome party for you.

94
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
That kind of thing

95
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,400
isn't really for me.

96
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,040
I just want to get to work
as soon as possible.

97
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,760
Sure. I'll put you to work now.

98
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
We hardly had any homicide cases here,

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,280
but there is one now.

100
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,840
Homicide case?

101
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,920
When was it?

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,880
It happened on Millennium Night.

103
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,480
The victim, Xu Yi,

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
was a local entrepreneur
here in Qingshui Town.

105
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Officer Lin,

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
the suspect has turned herself in.

107
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,360
The victim was her husband.

108
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,000
[Nan Ya is suspected of killing Xu Yi]
It happened at about 1 AM.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
The murder weapon was a knife.

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,000
Two stabs in total.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
One from the front,

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
and the other from the back.

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,160
The victim had died when we arrived.

114
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,320
What's your name?

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,560
Nan Ya.

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,120
Your age?

117
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,240
Thirty year old

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,760
Please describe the circumstances
of the incident.

119
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
Xu Yi had been abusing me.

120
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,840
Everyone here knows.

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,200
All I wanted was a divorce,

122
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,080
but he threatened me
with our daughter every time.

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,800
Wanwan is ill

124
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,600
and couldn't take that.

125
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,000
I had tried everything.

126
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,200
He just wouldn't agree to divorce me.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
You want to divorce me?

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,840
You wish.

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,040
Even if I'll end up in hell,

130
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm taking you with me.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,080
Then it was the bridge case.

132
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
I got to know some truth behind it.

133
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,680
They secretly changed the design

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
and cut corners.

135
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,680
As a result, the half-built bridge
suddenly collapsed,

136
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,640
and two workers even died
in that accident.

137
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,640
I told him I had evidence

138
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
and asked for a divorce.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,040
Are you threatening me?

140
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,040
I said stop!

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,840
Want to escape, huh?

142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,840
No way.

143
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,120
No way!

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Everything you've got is from me.

145
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,400
I've given you the best.

146
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
But you want me dead, right?

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,720
I'll let you die first.

148
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
Go to hell!

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,680
Bad woman.

150
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,120
Don't get any closer to me, Xu Yi.

151
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
Let's see who'll die today,

152
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,520
you or me!

153
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,080
Xu Yi!

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,360
You said after you killed Xu Yi,

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,280
you heard footsteps that night.

156
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,480
Do you know who that was?

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,880
No.

158
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,520
When I turned around,

159
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,880
he had run away.

160
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,120
We've found the witness.

161
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,680
It is Zhou Luo, Guixiang's son.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,200
He came to us at 6 AM.

163
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
The case happened between 1 AM and 2 AM.

164
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,320
Why did he not come until 6 AM?

165
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,800
Seeing that horrible thing,

166
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,640
he was probably terrified

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,520
at the moment.

168
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Tell me about

169
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,240
this Zhou Luo.

170
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,560
He's repeating his Grade 12
at Huashan Cram School.

171
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
How come he was there?

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Seems he was sending the kid,

173
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Wanwan, Nan Ya's daughter, home.

174
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,840
They live close to each other,

175
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,200
so Guixiang sometimes

176
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,480
look after the kid.

177
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,560
Who was on call?

178
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,280
Shi Leshan.

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Tell Officer Lin one more time

180
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
what Zhuo Luo did that day.

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
He called us first,

182
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,040
and his parents came with him.

183
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
What he said about the scene was

184
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
basically the same as what Nan Ya said.

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,760
How did he look

186
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
when he was talking?

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Relatively calm.

188
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
He asked for water first

189
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
and drank it all.

190
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
He made it pretty clear.

191
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
Then why did he run?

192
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,240
He said he was frightened

193
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,440
and ran without a second thought.

194
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,040
Did he go back again?

195
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,720
No.

196
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,560
Soy sauce and vinegar!

197
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,680
Soy sauce and vinegar!

198
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,120
Soy sauce and vinegar!

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,920
Soy sauce and vinegar!

200
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
Luo.

201
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Where are you going?

202
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
School.

203
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,120
You've learned all that.

204
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
Why not stay at home today?

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,080
Well, let's see...

206
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,240
[Huashan Cram School,
Xingchen Vocational School]

207
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
You can

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,880
take the day off.

209
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,840
Go back home and take a rest.

210
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,280
Actually,

211
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm fine.

212
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm worried about you.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,040
I don't want you affected

214
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,920
by seeing all that.

215
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,360
[Be determined to move forward.]
Zhou Luo?

216
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,840
[To succeed, work hard first.]
How come he saw that?

217
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
[Practice more.]
Well...

218
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,680
[Don't leave any regret.]
Who knows?

219
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,440
Qingli.

220
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,040
Nan Ya killed someone.

221
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,720
It's true.
The news is all over the town.

222
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
Who was killed by her?

223
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
Xu Yi, of course.
Who else could it be?

224
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,920
Chen Jun's dad went to check the scene.

225
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,880
The man died on the spot with two stabs.

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Zhuo Luo is really screwed,

227
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,040
seeing all that.

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,800
Did he see it?

229
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
When was that?

230
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
The day before yesterday.

231
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
On Millennium Night.

232
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,440
Where's my stuff?

233
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,480
What stuff?

234
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,400
You know it.

235
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,560
If It were me who took it,

236
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
do you think
I would give it back to you?

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
Xu Yi is the car owner.

238
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,840
The car burst into flames
on Millennium Night too.

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
We speculate it was about midnight.

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,120
The oil tank was then set on fire,

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,440
which caused the explosion.

242
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,000
All the people in town

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
were by the river
watching the fireworks,

244
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
which lasted for almost 30 minutes.

245
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,640
The sound of the fireworks overlapped

246
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
with the explosion,

247
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
so few people

248
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
noticed it.

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
What caused the fire?

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
The New Year was coming,

251
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,880
and kids were playing with firecrackers

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,840
here and there.

253
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
The oil was probably leaking
out of the car,

254
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,320
so it got set on fire.

255
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,760
What a coincidence.

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,240
The owner happened to be
Xu Yi, the victim.

257
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,400
You suspect it was deliberate?

258
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,160
But based on our speculation,

259
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,520
the fire happened
earlier than the killing.

260
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
And that was when Nan Ya was fighting

261
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,520
with Xu Yi.

262
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
So you are saying

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
someone else did it deliberately.

264
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,000
What's going on?

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,960
What happened?

266
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,560
Don't you know
Xu Yi died the night before?

267
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Xu Yi died?

268
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,600
How come?

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,960
The police are all here.

270
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,200
I heard it was quite terrifying.

271
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,400
It looked horrible.

272
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,520
Officer Lin,

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,880
this is Wang Yao.

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,640
That's Chen, Chen Guoying.

275
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,280
They're our experienced colleagues.

276
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,080
Yao. Chen.

277
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,440
This is Officer Lin,
our new deputy leader.

278
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,640
Greetings, Officer Lin.

279
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,000
Careful, mind your step.

280
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,960
Chen.

281
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,800
Is there anything different

282
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,120
from what the suspect said?

283
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,720
Nothing as of now.

284
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
Is the forensics done?

285
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,000
We got the call.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,040
The stab in the chest
punctured his heart arteries,

287
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
which mainly led to his death.

288
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,040
The time of death was
between midnight to 2 AM.

289
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,080
A detailed autopsy report

290
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,200
will take a bit more time.

291
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
Xu Yi!

292
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,840
Xu Yi!

293
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,560
Where are the photos?

294
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,120
You won't find any.

295
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,200
You want me dead, huh?

296
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,280
I'll give them to you
if you sign the divorce papers.

297
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,680
What if I don't?

298
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,880
I'll call the police tomorrow.

299
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
You'll be in jail and I'll be free.

300
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,640
Are you threatening me?

301
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
What do you think?

302
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
What do you mean?

303
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
Do you think

304
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,240
it was

305
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,920
self-defense?

306
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,480
How's that possible?

307
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,120
A big and strong man

308
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,640
couldn't hurt a woman with an axe,

309
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,480
but got stabbed

310
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
by that woman.

311
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,880
Do you believe it?

312
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,880
Then what do you mean?

313
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,600
Do you think she drugged the victim?

314
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
Or

315
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
the victim was really drunk

316
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,280
and couldn't hurt her.

317
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
Well,

318
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,880
once the autopsy report is available,

319
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,240
we'll know about that.

320
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,720
What about the motive?

321
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,280
This woman

322
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,800
has a bad reputation.

323
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,480
The victim

324
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,680
was not abusing her for no reason.

325
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,240
Is there anything wrong with her?

326
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,280
Yeah, a lot.

327
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
She hooked up with guys,

328
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,480
and she got beaten because of that.

329
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
They came to us quite a lot

330
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,600
with all those fights.

331
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,600
You seem to have
negative comments on the suspect.

332
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,520
I'm not well educated.

333
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
I won't

334
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,480
be nitpicking on words.

335
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,280
But everyone in Qingshui Town knows

336
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,280
what this woman is like.

337
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,680
Shouldn't I consider that?

338
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,520
The victim endangered her life,

339
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
and she defended herself with a knife.

340
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,480
A witness saw all of that.

341
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,800
How would you explain this?

342
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,440
That witness is just a kid.

343
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,320
He could remember it wrong

344
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,840
and was just totally freaked out.

345
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,080
Who knows what happened

346
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,040
that night?

347
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,080
How many years
have you been a police officer?

348
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,440
Seven years.

349
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,480
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful woman like her?

350
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,480
Look at her face, her boobs

351
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,960
and her fair skin.

352
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,720
What do you think
those men go to her store for?

353
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,000
I saw it.

354
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,440
After the fireworks,

355
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,120
they were fighting on the dike.

356
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,480
Xu Yi slapped Nan Ya's face.

357
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,720
Nan Ya must be in pain.

358
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,120
My turn!

359
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,720
One character!

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,120
She deserves it.

361
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,680
Xu Yi was nice

362
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,040
to everyone.

363
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,040
He was a generous guy.

364
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,600
But he only beat her.

365
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,520
You know why?

366
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,960
Xu Yi treated her really well.

367
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
Even though she gave birth to a sick kid,

368
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,720
Xu Yi still

369
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
raised that child.

370
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,120
Xu Yi couldn't control her.

371
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,320
He beat her all day

372
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,480
and tried to please her afterward.

373
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,120
Think about what happened
at the train station.

374
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,360
He could even put up with it.

375
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,680
He just didn't want a divorce.

376
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
See? Now he paid his life.

377
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,760
[The train station incident]

So Zhou Luo has been in his room?

565
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,920
Yes.

566
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,400
How is he these days?

567
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,200
Seeing all that,

568
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
he is surely scared.

569
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,240
He's a teenager, after all.

570
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,760
You really saw it?

571
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
Perjury is illegal.

572
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,600
Xu Yi's car got burned.

573
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Do you know that?

574
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah.

575
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,640
Then what if

576
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,520
the things in his car...?

577
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,760
Do not talk about that thing.

578
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,040
As long as we don't say it,

579
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
no one will know.

580
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,000
Can I talk to you guys for a minute?

581
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,400
Sure.

582
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,800
My name is Lin Fanglu.

583
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,720
I've just been transferred
to Yishan Police.

584
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,360
I also graduated from
Qingshui No. 1 High School.

585
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,240
If you don't mind,

586
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,920
just take me as your senior student.

587
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,960
I heard you are a very good student

588
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,200
and got a special admission
to Jinghua University.

589
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,520
I'll still have to take the exam.

590
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,600
I can't get in
if I don't do well in the exam.

591
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
All right. I'm here with some questions.

592
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,360
At the countdown on that night,

593
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,240
were you all by the river?

594
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,520
Yeah, we were.

595
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,960
[Zhou Luo, All by the river]
Did you see Nan Ya and Xu Yi?

596
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,960
Everyone in town was there.

597
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,160
Yes.

598
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,640
What about you, Zhou Luo?

599
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,560
Nan Ya had been in your store

600
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,320
that night, right?

601
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,040
Yes.

602
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,760
Did she look any different?

603
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,040
Not really.

604
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,720
Did Xu Yi quarrel with her?

605
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,040
When Xu Yi came,

606
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,880
I was playing billiards
with them upstairs.

607
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,640
That's to say,

608
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,200
none of you saw
Xu Yi arguing with Nan Ya.

609
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,960
Guixiang told me

610
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,000
you had a stomachache
before the countdown,

611
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,360
so you got back home.

612
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,400
Yes.

613
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,960
When was that exactly?

614
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,080
The fireworks were at midnight...

615
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,720
About half an hour before that.

616
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,800
So, it was 11:30 PM.

617
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
[11:30?]

618
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,960
When you went back to the river,

619
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
did the fireworks finish?

620
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,440
Yes.

621
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
I was asleep

622
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,120
and got woken up by fireworks.

623
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,920
Do you remember what time that was?

624
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,440
Around 12:40 PM.

625
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,480
[12:40]
Did you go

626
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,960
anywhere else in between?

627
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,400
No, I was at home.

628
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,400
Am I right to think

629
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,080
you arrived at Nan Ya's place

630
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
around 1 AM?

631
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes.

632
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,880
Let's see

633
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,520
who'll die today, you or me?

634
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,560
Why didn't you call the police

635
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,320
as soon as you saw it?

636
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,520
I panicked.

637
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
I realized Wanwan was also in the house.

638
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,680
I didn't want her to see it.

639
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,080
I shouldn't have run.

640
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,840
So you were not sure if Xu Yi had died.

641
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,480
No.

642
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,040
Then why didn't you go find someone

643
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,160
to stop their fight?

644
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,800
I just thought

645
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,000
Xu Yi didn't look like

646
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
he could fight anymore.

647
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,160
Did you not think about
going back and checking again?

648
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,320
I did.

649
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
Then why didn't you?

650
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,640
Were you trying to leave enough time
for Nan Ya to turn herself in?

651
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
I wasn't sure

652
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,040
if she was going to do that.

653
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,920
Really?

654
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Okay, I see.

655
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,160
If there's anything with Wanwan,

656
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,200
just call me at the police station.

657
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,040
Here's our number.

658
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,720
I'll keep it safe.

659
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,720
Thank you.

660
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,000
See you, Officer Lin.

661
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,240
[Ad: room on 2nd floor for rent]
Are you renting out your room upstairs?

662
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
It has been for storage

663
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,560
and hasn't been cleaned until now.

664
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Just trying

665
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,080
to make use of it.

666
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,480
Can I see it?

667
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,560
Of course.

668
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,080
It's upstairs.

669
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,160
This way.

670
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Hey,

671
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,280
that night,

672
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,680
did you tell Zhou Luo?

673
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,840
Tell him what?

674
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Your feelings!

675
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,720
Nope.

676
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,280
Then where did you go?

677
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,760
You didn't come back the whole night.

678
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,680
We didn't go anywhere.

679
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,680
I just felt it wasn't the right time,

680
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,240
so I didn't say anything.

681
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,520
Well, that's okay.

682
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,640
It wasn't a lucky day.

683
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,080
After all,

684
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,200
Zhou Luo ran into something like that.

685
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,760
I will not tell him
about my feelings in the future.

686
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,840
Why?

687
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,840
Then, he will be someone's boyfriend!

688
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,160
What's wrong?

689
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,840
I forgot something at Zhou Luo's place.

690
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,880
What is it?

691
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Just a book.

692
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,840
Then get it tomorrow.

693
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,760
You go first. I'll get it now.

694
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,440
You were not at home that night.

695
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,560
I waited outside your house
for a long time

696
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,400
and didn't leave
until the fireworks ended.

697
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Why did you lie to the officer?

698
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,360
[Millennium Night (31 December, 1999)]

699
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,160

705
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,080
There's a video store downstairs.

706
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,640
There will be music
playing here during the day.

707
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,840
It could be noisy.

708
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
It's okay.
I won't be here during the day.

709
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,040
I'll be at the police station.

710
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,120
I'd live close to Wanwan.

711
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,280
If there's an emergency,

712
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,160
I can help.

713
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
I see.

714
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,560
When I finish my work tonight,
I will move in.

715
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,560
This evening?

716
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,040
Yes.

717
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,480
See you.

718
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
I'll show you something.

719
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,240

Take a seat.

723
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,480
I was here that night.

00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,040
China is the 12th country in the world

You know

the 180th meridian, right?

728
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,640
The line that is called the one

729
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,480
to divide today and yesterday,

730
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,280
which is the International Date Line.

731
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,280
The closest country to this line

732
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,480
is Kiribati.

733
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,880
It's the first country
that started the year 2000.

734
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,080
[Kiribati]
I was here that night

735
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,640
[Australia]

736
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,120
[North Korea, South Korea, Japan]
to let people know

In this chat room,

741
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
someone would pop up
every few minutes and say,

"Happy New Year."

743
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,080
So to me,

744
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,640

than the fireworks.

00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,080
Let me tell you another secret.

750
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,880
I actually got into the internet bar

751
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,080
by picking the lock.

752
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,760
The owner is timid.

753
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,230
He doesn't want others to know

754
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,520
he's accessing
to foreign links secretly,

755
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,400
or he'll get into trouble.

756
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
That's why I didn't tell the officer.

757
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,600
Well,

758
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,080
I guess I was overthinking.

759
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,400
Sorry for that.

760
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,600
Nan Ya is a poor lady.

761
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
I saw what was going on that night.

762
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,840
I just told the police the truth.

763
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,520
As for Nan Ya and Xu Yi,

764
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,200
whoever was more to blame,

765
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,600
I don't think it's up to us to judge.

766
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,200
It's up to the law.

767
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,000
You're right.

768
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,040
Why are you so attentive?

769
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,400
You know nothing.

770
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
He graduated from the University
of Political Science and Law,

771
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,560
and his father-in-law is a big shot.

772
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,400
Why does he come here then?

773
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,200
Probably just

774
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,080
gaining more experience
and making his resume look better.

775
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,040
Why do we have to care?

776
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,480
He'll be gone

777
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,560
if that's the case.

778
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,400
He has nothing to do with you.

779
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,520
It can't go wrong to get along with him.

780
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,600
Officer Lin,

781
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
the desk is ready for you.

782
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,640
This one.

783
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,480
It's already late.

784
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,120
Are you not leaving?

785
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,400
The interrogation is ongoing.

786
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,760
Who's being interrogated?

787
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,720
Nan Ya.

788
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,360
Chen doesn't think it was self-defense

789
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,240
and was up for another round.

790
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,840
Nonsense!

791
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,840
What's the bridge collapse
to do with Xu Yi?

792
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,560
Ridiculous.

793
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,600
Then tell me,

794
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,680
why was Xu Yi trying to kill you?

795
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,000
Chen, can you come out?

796
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,080
I need to talk to you.

797
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,760
Can you not interrupt

798
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,680
my interrogation?

799
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,520
Stop it immediately.

800
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,220
Why?

801
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,880
A grueling trial isn't fair
to the suspect.

802
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,080
"Self-defense" sounds fair
to the victim, huh?

803
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,680
You're taking it too personally.

804
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,880
Don't talk nonsense.

805
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,240
Don't ruin my reputation.

806
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,920
A woman got beaten badly like that.

807
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,960
If she was really in danger

808
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,080
and killed him by accident,

809
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,000
such a strict grueling trial

810
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,280
would be inhumane.

811
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,040
Enough.

812
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,560
Wang,

813
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,200
it's over.

814
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,080
Take her back.

815
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,360
Don't think you're better than us,

816
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,440
because you're transferred
from the province.

817
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,280
Xu died,

818
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
and his family is out there watching us.

819
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,080
There's never been a self-defense case

820
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,520
over the years.

821
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,600
I don't want to hear people say

822
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,200
I can't solve crimes.

823
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,200
Come on.

824
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,920
Come in.

825
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
My mom asked me to give these to you.

826
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,080
She made these before the New Year.

827
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,360
They've been out for drying.

828
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,720
We haven't got
an electric blanket for you.

829
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,160
Use the hot water bottle instead.

830
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,360
Thank you.

831
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Are you free?

832
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,480
Can you help me move these?

833
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,040
Okay.

834
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,880
The desk is to be put here.

835
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,680
We've had Xu Yi's autopsy report.

836
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,400
Turn it around.

837
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,080
He died of a ruptured heart artery.

838
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,040
The stab in the back wasn't lethal.

839
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,880
The one in the chest was.

840
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,840
The bed is to be moved there.

841
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,680
Seeing that bloody scene

842
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,440
could traumatize you.

843
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,080
You may have stress responses,

844
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,840
like nightmares

845
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
and insomnia.

846
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,360
Some symptoms

847
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,520
don't show up immediately,

848
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,560
but years later,

849
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,280
they can cause mental issues.

850
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,600
I know some experts

851
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,080
in the provincial capital.

852
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,080
If you need,

853
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,560
I can introduce them to you.

854
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,280
No need.
Now that it's done, I'll leave.

855
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,360
I read the case file.

856
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,760
It says Xu Yi had beat you.

857
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,680
Do you hate him?

858
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,280
Do you think I lied to you?

859
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,200
Did you?

860
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,880
Will you believe it if I say no?
