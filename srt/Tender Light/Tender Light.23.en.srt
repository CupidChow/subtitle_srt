[Episode 23]

2
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,140
Come on and catch me, Mommy.

3
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,340
Young spring welcomes everyone.

4
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,860
Nightingale,

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,900
I can hear you sing.

6
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,620
Come on, Mommy.

7
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,740
Your melody is so beautiful yet so sad.

8
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,020
Your soft whimper resonates continually.

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,580
Your song is filled with passion.

10
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,060
Spring has arrived.

11
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,580
Flowers bloom on the trees.

12
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,660
Catch me, Mommy.

13
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,820
Come on.

14
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,700
In the clear blue sky,

15
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,780
rose-colored clouds float.

16
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,740
The amorous sunshine is

17
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,660
gently chasing butterflies.

18
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,500
[Tender Light]

19
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,420
Well... Allow me.

20
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,260
I bought you baozi and congee.

21
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,860
Have some before you go.

22
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,100
No, thanks. I'm going to see Wanwan
at the hospital.

23
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,220
It's going to be a long wait.

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,500
Won't you have a baozi...

25
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,220
I don't need

26
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,380
your childish and perfunctory concern.

27
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,940
I need to see Wanwan now

28
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,500
or I'll lose my mind!

29
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,140
Well, Nan Ya?

30
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,940
How did it go?

31
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,900
Did you find Wanwan?

32
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,020
The doctor said

33
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,860
it was already past time for therapy.

34
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Perhaps he brought Wanwan
to another hospital?

35
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,700
You may go back now.

36
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm going to the law firm.

37
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,700
[Divorce Complaint]
Here's the paperwork.

38
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,300
You can only

39
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,420
sue him now,

40
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,100
but it'll take a while

41
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,340
before the court hears your case.

42
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
Xu Yi

43
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,820
must have consulted
a very experienced lawyer,

44
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,940
judging by his behavior.

45
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,620
What do you mean?

46
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,060
He'll most likely hide your daughter

47
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,860
for a very long time.

48
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,100
There's an unwritten rule

49
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,620
that whoever spends more time
with the child

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,580
will get the custody.

51
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,220
When you were living in the house
co-owned by you and Xu Yi,

52
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,140
you did not forbid Xu Yi
from seeing her.

53
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,860
So technically,

54
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,260
you did not raise her alone.

55
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,700
But things are different now.

56
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,780
Ms. Nan Ya!

57
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,540
Zhou Luo, there she is.

58
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,820
Thanks.

59
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,260
Hello? Chen Ling.

60
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,340
Please hear me out, Chen Ling.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,580
Please, Chen Ling.

62
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,740
Please...

63
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,380
Please tell Xu Yi

64
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,500
to take Wanwan to see the doctor today.

65
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,300
Tell him I won't fight

66
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,300
with him anymore,

67
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,900
as long as he brings her
to the hospital.

68
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,780
I have to go to work.
I don't have time to listen to you.

69
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,700
Chen Ling...

70
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,660
Mommy, I want Mommy...

71
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,300
Wanwan.

72
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Wanwan... Chen Ling, let me
speak with Wanwan.

73
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,140
Chen Ling!

74
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,460
Poor Nan Ya.

75
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,380
I feel so bad for her.

76
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,780
[Divorce, how is custody determined]
I mustn't end up like that.

77
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,740
I must get into university.

78
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,380
I heard she had good grades

79
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,820
when she was
in Qingshui No. 1 High School.

80
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,580
How come she didn't get into university?

81
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,460
My sister told me,

82
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,060
after her dad passed away,

83
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,060
her stepmom forbade her from studying

84
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,100
and forced her to work at a factory.

85
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,700
But we're just students.

86
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,420
What can we do?

87
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,500
Yeah, what can we do?

88
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,420
This is none of our business anyway.

89
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,140
My mom said,

90
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,340
no matter

91
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,180
how much they fought and argued,

92
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,620
they're still husband and wife.

93
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,860
Their daughter's custody
is their business.

94
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,260
There is no right or wrong.

95
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,220
It's not up to us outsiders

96
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,900
to judge.

97
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Is that what you think?

98
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,540
Yeah.

99
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,500
Suppose if Chen Jun and you got married,

100
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,580
he abused you every day,

101
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,220
but you couldn't divorce him

102
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,420
because he threatened you
with your child,

103
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,340
what would you do?

104
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,340
How dare he!

105
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,220
Do you have a death wish?

106
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,900
Let me go.

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,820
You're still doing this at this time?

108
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,980
If you ask me,

109
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,620
we should tie him up,
take him to somewhere secluded,

110
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060
and beat him up.

111
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,540
Ask him to hand over the kid.

112
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,140
And you want to be a policeman?

113
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,460
Kidnapping is illegal, you know?

114
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,060
Chen Ling.

115
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,180
This is our problem.

116
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,860
Let's not involve the child, okay?

117
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,220
Don't make a scene at the hospital.

118
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,020
I beg you, please tell me
where Wanwan is.

119
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,100
Haven't you caused me enough trouble?

120
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,020
Chen Ling, tell me where Wanwan is.

121
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,220
Please, Chen Ling.

122
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,900
Can't you see I'm working?

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,820
Wait outside.

124
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,900
Xu Yi,

125
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,060
where's Wanwan?

126
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,340
Where's Wanwan?

127
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,220
Where's Wanwan?

128
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,620
Xu Yi...

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,420
Where are you hiding her, Xu Yi?

130
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,300
I told you.

131
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,140
It's no good

132
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,660
fighting me.

133
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
Where's Wanwan?

134
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,980
Where's Wanwan?

135
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,420
So, are they

136
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,700
on good terms again?

137
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,500
Let's not follow Xu Yi.

138
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,500
Nan Yi is so stupid.

139
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,900
I think

140
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,660
they'll never be separated
from each other.

141
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,740
Let's go.

142
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,220
Come on, let's go.

143
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,620
I heard Nan Ya

144
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
yielded to Xu Yi

145
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,340
and Wanwan also came back.

146
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,780
Yeah.

147
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,220
At least she got her child back.

148
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
You'll never understand
how a mother feels.

149
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,860
Being unable to see the child

150
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,180
is like dying.

151
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,260
So what if she has
to suffer a little for her daughter?

152
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,740
That's why I was saying

153
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,220
that Nan Ya couldn't divorce Xu Yi

154
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
that easily.

155
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,180
Businessmen

156
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,700
are cunning.

157
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,980
Besides, her daughter is seriously ill.

158
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,700
She needs money.

159
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,620
Escaping from him

160
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,620
won't be that easy.

161
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,300
Unless

162
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,500
Xu Yi is dead.

163
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

164
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,060
That way, life would be easier.

165
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,740
I'm done.

166
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,980
But you hardly had my new dish.

167
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
That was quick.

168
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,140
You may eat more, then.

169
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,740
Well?

170
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,180
Have you thought it through?

171
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,060
Yes.

172
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,540
Then tell us.

173
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,780
What happened that night?

174
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,020
I saw Xu Yi going after Nan Ya
with an axe.

175
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,980
Nan Ya accidentally killed Xu Yi.

176
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,740
Still won't confess, Zhou Luo?

177
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,420
We're trying to help you here.

178
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,580
We're giving you a chance to confess.

179
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,340
You have to plead guilty

180
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,420
before you can get a lighter sentence,

181
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,500
do you understand?

182
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,460
Confess?

183
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
To what crime?

184
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,580
You know what you did!

185
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,980
Let's look at some photos,

186
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,180
shall we?

187
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,860
This is a photo of Xu Yi
meeting Liu Changshui.

188
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,940
Did you take this?

189
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,700
No.

190
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,540
Liar!

191
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,500
Who took the photo, then?

192
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,500
The camera shop owner identified you.

193
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,660
Zhang Qingli and the others
also admitted it.

194
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,060
Why won't you confess?

195
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,740
It's because you're guilty!

196
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,940
The camera shop owner? Which one?

197
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,500
Did he identify me himself?

198
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,100
When? Do you have the receipt?

199
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,980
Surely you used a fake name
to conceal your identity.

200
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,580
What fake name did I use?

201
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,060
Zhou Luo,

202
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,780
you can use a fake name,

203
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,060
but you can't change how you look.

204
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,980
If you insist that's the truth,

205
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,780
there's nothing I can say.

206
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,540
But I didn't take those photos.

207
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,140
Besides, what could I gain

208
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,620
from photographing them?

209
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
Because if Xu Yi ends up in jail,

210
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,260
you can be together with Nan Ya.

211
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,140
There's nothing wrong
with pitying Nan Ya,

212
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,180
but you've chosen
the wrong path. Got it?

213
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,500
What you said seems to make sense.

214
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,460
But not everything in this world

215
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,900
can be proven to be true

216
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,740
simply based

217
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,220
on logic alone.

218
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,540
Don't play word games with me!

219
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Zhou Luo

220
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
did not personally
get the photos printed.

221
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,540
He knows we don't have direct evidence.

222
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,460
It won't be easy to deal with him.

223
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,820
Without direct evidence,
if we keep interrogating him,

224
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,580
it will give him a chance
to understand the situation.

225
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,780
But if we don't interrogate him,

226
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,340
we cannot find a breakthrough.

227
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,380
Zhou Luo.

228
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,820
Has Nan Ya

229
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,140
told you about what happened
between her and Hu Lifan?

230
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:57,940
No.

231
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,940
Well, do you know

232
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,740
Hu Lifan had raped Nan Ya before?

233
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,020
Well,

234
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,540
Xu Yi was not a bad person

235
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,740
in the beginning.

236
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,620
He murdered Hu Lifan

237
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,260
for Nan Ya, didn't he?

238
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,780
He had no grudge against him.

239
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,260
Right?

240
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,060
In order to get away with it,

241
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,620
he dumped the body into the lake
on the outskirts.

242
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,660
When you followed

243
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,780
Xu Yi and Liu Changshui

244
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
to the restaurant,

245
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,940
do you remember there was a way up
to the mountain next to it?

246
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,140
It was him!

247
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,580
Chen is really good at interrogating.

248
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,940
I think Zhou Luo

249
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,740
may have threatened Xu Yi.

250
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,580
Do you remember?

251
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,660
What does this have to do with me?

252
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,340
It indeed has nothing to do with you.

253
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,100
Well,

254
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,500
I just have some advice for you.

255
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,700
Don't get yourself

256
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,460
mixed up in complicated love affairs.

257
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,580
Look what Xu Yi had done.

258
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,780
Can you say he didn't love Nan Ya?

259
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,780
I'm not the same as him.

260
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,980
With my decades of experience
in handling cases,

261
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,260
once you try to cover up a crime,

262
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,060
there's no turning back.

263
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,220
Take Xu Yi for example.

264
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,900
He used to be quite mild-mannered.

265
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,180
He was from a rich family, too.

266
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,620
Now look where it led him.

267
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,020
Two people died,

268
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,140
and then there was the bridge case.

269
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,780
Zhou Luo,

270
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,620
think about your mother.

271
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,380
She's worried sick about you.

272
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,660
How much more can she take?

273
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,260
Right? Already twice.

274
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,660
You almost went to university twice.

275
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,100
Sure,

276
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,660
it's impossible to go to university now,

277
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,820
but at least try to get yourself
out of jail earlier.

278
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,820
Then, you can see her again.

279
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,820
Take your time, sort it out.

280
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I understand how you feel,

281
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,100
all right?

282
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,020
Think it through,

283
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,300
okay?

284
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,340
There's no hurry.

285
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,860
We can wait.

286
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,140
Think about it.

287
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,900
I saw Xu Yi going after Nan Ya
with an axe.

288
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
Nan Ya accidentally killed Xu Yi.

289
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,300
Take him away.

290
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,980
Wanwan,

291
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,340
look.

292
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,940
Do you like the new toy I bought you?

293
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,540
Here, take it.

294
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,500
Let me hold her.

295
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,780
Wanwan.

296
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,220
Found your daughter, Nan Ya?

297
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,540
Yes.

298
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,220
Just a little blunder.

299
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,900
She was with me all along.

300
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,100
I took her to the zoo.

301
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,580
Nan Ya,

302
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,260
is Wanwan all right?

303
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
No worries, Guixiang.
She was with me all long.

304
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,300
It was a misunderstanding.

305
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,420
As long as Wanwan is fine.

306
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,340
She's fine.

307
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,660
Everything's all right now?

308
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,220
Yeah.

309
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,580
Isn't this fun?

310
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,420
Do you think

311
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,700
Zhou Luo

312
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,020
and Nan Ya...

313
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,940
He's been absent for two days.

314
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,180
Besides, he's been cold

315
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,500
and quiet.

316
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,420
Cut it out.

317
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,220
You girls don't understand men.

318
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,580
Zhou Luo must be depressed.

319
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,020
If I try to help someone

320
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,580
but end up looking like a fool,

321
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,700
I'd surely be devastated.

322
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,260
What makes you so sure?

323
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,500
Because we're bros.

324
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,900
Do you know what I'm saying?

325
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,300
Like how you'd tell Qingli everything.

326
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,820
I'm not messing around
with you girls here.

327
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,580
You girls are always womanishly fussy
and suspicious.

328
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,300
Geez.

329
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,700
What's on Zhou Luo's mind?

330
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,740
I have no clue.

331
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,820
I'd just ask him if I were you.

332
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,060
But I'm afraid our friendship
will be ruined.

333
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,100
Then so be it.

334
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,340
Don't be afraid.

335
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,460
Bingbing.

336
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,820
Have you ever

337
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,340
liked someone?

338
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,100
You like him so much that you're happy

339
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,500
just being friends?

340
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,340
What's the matter?

341
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Are you okay?

342
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,940
I'm fine.

343
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,420
There, there. Don't cry.

344
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,780
Okay.

345
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,660
[Yishan Second People's Hospital]

346
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,220
Here's your prescription.

347
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Thank you, Dr. Jiang.

348
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,020
Don't mention it.
Be careful with your diet.

349
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,100
You registered in your own name?

350
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,060
I couldn't register in Wanwan's name.

351
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,780
She has too much medical debt.

352
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,020
Can you give her a check-up?

353
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,020
I'll get the medicine elsewhere.

354
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,700
Sorry,

355
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,500
it's against the rules.

356
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,980
I'm only allowed to treat patients
registering in their own names.

357
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,500
I understand, but can you please
make an exception?

358
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,740
We've encountered some trouble.

359
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,660
Xu Yi ran out of all our money.

360
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,940
Hence, Wanwan's medical bills
couldn't be paid for such a long time.

361
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,220
My daughter's health is at stake here.

362
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,580
I'm trying my best to raise money.

363
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,500
I really can't help you.

364
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,660
Rules are rules.

365
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,500
I can only treat patients
registering in their own names.

366
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,940
Okay. Next patient.

367
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,260
Yes, you. Come in.

368
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
Please make an exception.

369
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,820
I really can't.

370
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,460
I'm having random pains.

371
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,180
Fret not.

372
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,940
Mr. Wang.

373
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,500
Nan Ya, there you are.

374
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,260
You're just in time.

375
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,780
Look.

376
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,700
I have a new shipment from Guangdong.

377
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,260
They're all top brands
from Hong Kong, China.

378
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,980
Look.

379
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,300
Check out the workmanship and quality.

380
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,860
What do you think?

381
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,340
They're pretty good.

382
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,780
But I won't take them this time.

383
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,580
Really?

384
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,460
Are you kidding?

385
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
The other customers would kill
for these.

386
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
I'm only offering them to you
because you've been

387
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,540
a regular customer.

388
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,540
Actually, I'm here to ask you,

389
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,660
do you have a job offer here?

390
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,180
Looking for a job?

391
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,580
Strapped for cash?

392
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,580
I do have a job offer.

393
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,820
Several days ago,

394
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,460
Director Pu from the Children's Palace

395
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,220
placed an order for a batch of costumes
for the children's performance.

396
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,700
If I hire you,

397
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,980
I could save on design costs.

398
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,020
The question is, can you handle it
by yourself?

399
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,900
How many pieces do you need?

400
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,100
Five sets, 100 pieces.

401
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,580
Due first week next month.

402
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,940
Five pieces a day...

403
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,180
I'll need 20 days or so.

404
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,260
Are you sure?

405
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,140
Don't drop the ball, okay?

406
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
No problem. You can count on me.

407
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,860
You're really hard up,

408
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,180
aren't you?

409
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,300
These are the measurements.

410
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,340
Take it and do your work.

411
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,180
Thank you, sir.

412
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,260
Be obedient
at Madam Guixiang's place, okay?

413
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,180
Take this and pay the medical bills.

414
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,940
I can't accept this, Guixiang.

415
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,180
Take it.

416
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,500
Well, you've done more than enough

417
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,580
by babysitting Wanwan.

418
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,540
Just take it as I lend it to you.

419
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,260
Wanwan needs treatment.

420
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,740
I wouldn't lend you money otherwise.

421
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:25,860
I...

422
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll pay you back a bit next month.

423
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,180
Take your time.

424
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,340
Just pay me back before Zhou Luo
goes to university.

425
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,220
All right?

426
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,100
I had some savings

427
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,860
but Xu Yi got into trouble
and took them all.

428
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,780
Sorry.

429
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,300
Don't say that.

430
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Everyone has their own struggle.

431
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,660
What are you spinning around for?

432
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,780
Say,

433
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I have some work to do tonight.

434
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,180
Would you like to be my little helper?

435
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,980
Sure.

436
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,460
Can you count?

437
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,620
Sure.

438
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,660
How clever!

439
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,180
If so,

440
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,420
can you help me count bubblegums,

441
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,700
chocolates, and toys?

442
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,260
Sure.

443
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,420
Good girl.

444
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
Say goodbye to Mommy.

445
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,660
Goodbye.

446
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,980
Listen to Madam Guixiang, okay?

447
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,500
Okay.

448
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,060
What a good girl.

449
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,420
Guixiang, I have to go now.

450
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,180
No worries.

451
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,820
Come on.

452
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,940
Let's get to work, shall we?

453
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,660
Sure.

454
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,740
I'm so happy having you accompany me.

455
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,500
Good.

456
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,380
No problem.

457
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,100
100 pieces?

458
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,660
Yes.

459
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,300
All right.

460
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,180
Here's 3,000 yuan.
You can have a count.

461
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,460
No need. Thanks.

462
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,340
You're welcome.

463
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,100
Bye.

464
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,380
Enough!

465
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,420
Honey, I'm home.

466
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,820
I know you're still mad about
what happened at the train station.

467
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,460
But that was because you were trying

468
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,060
to run away with Wanwan.

469
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,460
I'm even willing

470
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,740
to humiliate myself.

471
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,260
Why?

472
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,260
Because I love you.

473
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
You are so shameless.

474
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
Am I wrong?

475
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,900
I hid Wanwan

476
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
because I wanted you to be anxious.

477
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,020
The bridge case

478
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,500
is making me scorched, so please.

479
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,740
If it weren't for Wanwan,

480
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,420
you'd be in prison right now.

481
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,260
If you have any humanity as a father,

482
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
you should let us go.

483
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,260
Don't bring that up.

484
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,780
It was me

485
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,500
who saved you from that jerk.

486
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,980
It was me

487
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,540
who married you
despite my family's disapproval.

488
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,340
Whatever you've eaten and used

489
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,700
is of the highest quality.

490
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,580
Have I done anything wrong?

491
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,100
Yes, I hit you.

492
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,900
So what?

493
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,500
Did I break your limbs?

494
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,820
Did I cripple you?

495
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,020
Did you know

496
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,340
how I've come through all these years?

497
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,020
Ever since that night,

498
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,980
I could never sleep properly.

499
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,460
I've dreamed many times

500
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,900
that I woke up by that lake.

501
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,300
Do you know what it feels like?

502
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,940
You must have forgotten.

503
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,660
Think about it.

504
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,780
Seeing the lake

505
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,020
will remind you

506
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,740
of why we're together, right?

507
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,420
It's a beautiful night.

508
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,340
Why don't we

509
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,660
go to the lake?

510
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,020
We might even

511
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,980
find something good in the lake.
Let's go.

512
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,540
Let go of me, Xu Yi!

513
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,420
Let's go.

514
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,500
Nan Ya.

515
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,060
Look how I am now.

516
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,740
Don't you think you should

517
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,060
share a bit of my pain?

518
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,660
Aren't you convinced

519
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,980
that how much I love you?

520
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,500
I can't stand it.

521
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,260
I can't stand you talking to other men

522
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,260
and laughing with them.

523
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,740
They don't deserve to see your smile.

524
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,700
You should ignore them.

525
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,460
Share all your laughter

526
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,300
and your happiness

527
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,500
with me only.

528
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,540
I just want you to belong to me only,

529
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,260
okay?

530
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,700
I'm sorry that I hit you.

531
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,420
I promise I'll never hit you again.

532
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,500
Let's be together

533
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,500
happily ever after,

534
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,420
just you and me.

535
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,820
Xu Yi,

536
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
I'm sick of seeing you like this.

537
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,220
Aren't you tired of pretending?

538
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,260
I knew all about you

539
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,300
and Chen Ling.

540
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,580
We're just...

541
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,700
Don't tell me
that you don't love Chen Ling at all.

542
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,260
It'll only make me despise you more.

543
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,020
Xu Yi,

544
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,500
I don't want to be entangled anymore.

545
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,020
I've brought Wanwan back to you.

546
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,980
Don't ever think
about getting a divorce.

547
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,260
Stop.

548
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,660
If you dare go upstairs, why run away?

549
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,260
I don't know what to say.

550
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,460
I know what you're going to say.

551
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,180
You do?

552
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,860
I appreciate you helping me
to find Wanwan.

553
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,420
But please

554
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,940
stay out of my business after this.

555
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,620
How can you say that
with such an understatement?

556
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,140
If you go back to Xu Yi,

557
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,060
your problems will never end.

558
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,420
Is that what you want?

559
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,420
To suffer, endure,

560
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,460
and surrender?

561
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,020
Who are you to question me?

562
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,100
As a...

563
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,460
a friend who's concerned about you.

564
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,780
We are never friends.

565
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,940
If you say so.

566
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,300
Are you disappointed in me?

567
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,700
It's okay.

568
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,740
Just leave.

569
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,820
I don't have the right
to be disappointed in you.

570
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,860
I just can't stand

571
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,260
to see you suffer

572
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,140
while I'm living my life
easily and happily.

573
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,620
On the long road of your life,

574
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,060
you will realize

575
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,380
it's meaningless to act a hero.

576
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,060
You cannot afford someone else' life,

577
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,980
especially someone
with whom you don't share a future.

578
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,620
The tragedy of men comes from arrogance.

579
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,500
You say I have a long life ahead of me.

580
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,260
But how can I face myself?

581
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,140
Leaving someone I love

582
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
in the lurch,

583
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,780
choosing

584
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,420
the easy path

585
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,940
and being a coward,

586
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
does such a person deserve to be alive?

587
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,900
That's how most people live.

588
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,940
But it's not how I want to live.

589
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,740
If there's nothing I can do,

590
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,940
or if I am not brave enough

591
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,180
to protect the girl I love,

592
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,220
I'd rather die.

593
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,260
Zhou Luo,
do you have any misunderstanding?

594
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,900
These are all your adolescent fantasies.

595
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,340
I'm not interested in you.

596
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,940
And I have no feelings for you.

597
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,220
I don't want to play house with you.

598
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,900
Do you understand?

599
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,140
There's nothing you can do to help me.

600
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,260
You should worry about yourself.

601
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,980
You got expelled,

602
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,340
and now you're in cram school.

603
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,660
Think about your future.

604
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,860
Don't pester me again.

605
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,660
Trying to save me?

606
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,860
Who do you think you are?

607
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,980
Leave now.

608
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,820
Leave!

609
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,660
The truth is, you do fancy me.

610
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,820
Don't you?

611
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,940
It's not that you don't care about me,

612
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,260
or you're not interested in me.

613
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,660
You're just afraid

614
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,340
of implicating me.

615
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,660
You're afraid

616
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,180
I'd get criticized
and blamed because of you.

617
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,420
You're afraid of ruining my future.

618
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,260
You're afraid I cannot stand
the pressure of life

619
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,380
and suffer

620
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,780
due to our age gap.

621
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,180
I know

622
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,420
you only said those things

623
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,900
because you care about me.

624
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,860
If you didn't like me,

625
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,260
you wouldn't feel afraid

626
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,980
and try to push me away.

627
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,580
If you didn't like me,

628
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,340
you'd simply decline my help

629
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,300
politely,

630
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,180
instead of trying to irritate me

631
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,940
and make me feel ashamed,
upset, and embarrassed.

632
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,460
You've tried so hard to keep me away

633
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,380
that I think

634
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,260
you're not just afraid
of getting into trouble.

635
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Why me?

636
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,420
We are just strangers chatting
with each other a few times.

637
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,780
Because you're the first one

638
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,180
to make me feel ashamed.

639
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,100
Can this be a reason
for falling in love with someone?

640
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,700
I had never felt ashamed before,

641
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,260
even when I was expelled.

642
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,140
I thought I did nothing wrong.

643
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,980
Until that day

644
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,420
at the shop...

645
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,180
When I first saw you,
I was only infatuated.

646
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,140
But when I saw you swimming
under the moonlight in the winter,

647
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,620
I knew

648
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,300
it was more than an infatuation.

649
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,980
When you told me you were leaving,

650
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,860
I was so sad that it felt like death.

651
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,180
But I could do nothing.

652
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,220
Because I had nothing,

653
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,460
and I could do nothing.

654
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,260
Later on, you decided to stay.

655
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,860
I promised myself I would
protect you with my life.

656
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,500
Otherwise,

657
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,140
I'd never be able to live with myself.

658
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,780
I want you to be happy.

659
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,420
Or at least be free.

660
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,500
If you don't want to be with me,

661
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,660
that's fine.

662
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,940
But please don't go back to him.

663
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,260
Compromise won't lead to happiness.
