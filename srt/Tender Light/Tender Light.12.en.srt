00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,100
[Episode 12]

2
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,700
Back off!

3
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,380
Medical examiner,

4
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,420
over here.

5
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,700
How is it?

6
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,300
We've found nothing.

7
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,100
Underwater visibility is too low.

8
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,700
If the corpse were in the water,

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,140
it would rise to the surface.

10
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,500
It wouldn't sink
in the water constantly.

11
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,740
Actually, we thought
the same thing before.

12
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,860
Maybe there's something heavy

13
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,620
dragging the body down.

14
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
It wouldn't be possible
to find the corpse

15
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,620
if it sank into the mud.

16
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,900
Let's give it a second try, okay?

17
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,340
Sure.

18
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,060
Okay. Thank you so much.

19
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,620
Just give up.

20
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
This is infuriating.

21
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,060
Maybe...

22
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,980
Maybe his body wasn't hidden here.

23
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,940
Perhaps

24
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,940
they weren't the ones who killed him.

25
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,660
I still need to thank you for this.

26
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,860
At least,

27
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,980
one of my troubles is resolved.

28
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,580
And now, it's mine.

29
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,260
There's nothing regretful about this.

30
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,660
All of us already did our best.

31
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,540
It's unprecedented

32
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,980
that our chief permitted this.

33
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,180
I've never seen this

34
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,020
in my life before.

35
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,780
Not being able to find the corpse

36
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,740
might be an answer itself.

37
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,420
Time to go.

38
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,380
Liu.

39
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,300
Guys, let's go!

40
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,540
Found it!

41
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,500
Chen! Officer Lin! Found it!

42
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,780
Found it!

43
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,820
Slowly.

44
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,020
Raise it over here.

45
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,220
It doesn't seem like a person
who's been dead for five years.

46
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,180
I found an ID card.

47
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,340
[Liu Changshui]

48
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,180
Liu Changshui?

49
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,380
We hit the mark by a fluke.

50
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,020
Liu Changshui?

51
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,860
Why is his body here?

52
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,780
Let the medical examiner inspect it.

53
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,420
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,260
Let's go.

55
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,380
Guys, let's go!

56
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
There's another one over here!

57
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:33,720
[Tender Light]

58
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,060
After examination,

59
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,820
these two bodies

60
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,660
are confirmed to be
Liu Changshui and Hu Lifan.

61
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,140
Liu Changshui's time of death

62
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,500
was about one month ago
according to our preliminary judgment.

63
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,460
It's likely
that he was killed not long after

64
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,380
he absconded with the money

65
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,820
As for Hu Lifan's corpse,

66
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,220
it's hard to determine
the exact time of death.

67
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,860
As his body was immersed in water
for a long period,

68
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,260
the microorganisms and the water

69
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,740
would've changed many elements.

70
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,900
According to my judgment,

71
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,140
I would say it's been over five years.

72
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,620
Well, how did Liu Changshui's body
end up like this,

73
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,780
since it was only in the water
for over a month?

74
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,500
How do you explain
Hu Lifan's condition, then?

75
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,100
These wax-like preserved bodies

76
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,300
is purely coincidental.

77
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,420
Even if you dump both of these bodies

78
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
into the water
at the same time and place,

79
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,140
the result might be totally different.

80
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,260
Judging from the skull's condition,

81
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,500
both of them were assaulted
by heavy objects.

82
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,740
However,
Liu Changshui died of asphyxiation.

83
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,820
We found plankton

84
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,900
within his nasal and oral cavities.

85
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,180
Due to that, we deduce

86
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,220
that Liu Changshui died of asphyxiation
after he was knocked out

87
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,820
and tied to a huge rock
as he sank toward the bottom.

88
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,060
Hu Lifan's skull was shattered.

89
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,700
He might have died
of a craniocerebral injury.

90
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,420
However, he could have died
from other causes.

91
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,500
We cannot come up with
a final conclusion

92
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,060
as his organs and tissues had dissolved.

93
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,100
The modus operands

94
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,540
were almost identical in both cases.

95
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,460
So, it's very likely that
it was the same person who killed them.

96
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,420
Judging from the witnesses' statements
and motives of crime,

97
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,940
Xu Yi would be the prime suspect.

98
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,820
But we haven't obtained
any direct evidence as of yet.

99
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
However, we can do a DNA test.

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,820
But our town is too remote.

101
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,180
We can't do it here.
We have to do it in the province.

102
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,460
That's not an issue.

103
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,740
I'll deal with it.

104
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,580
It's likely that Liu Changshui

105
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,620
was struck to the ground
with a heavy object without precaution.

106
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,180
There was no sign of a struggle.

107
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,300
As for Hu Lifan,

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,380
there's no way to compare his situation.

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,980
If so, the breakthrough point
for this case

110
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,300
can only be...

111
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,860
Nan Ya.

112
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,340
That's right.

113
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,500
When I was 17,

114
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,700
Hu Lifan raped me.

115
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,940
Nan Ya, where are you going?

116
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,500
Nan Ya.

117
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,140
Where are you going?

118
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,860
I'm going to school.

119
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,420
Wait, you should eat first.

120
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,220
Right? Let's eat first. Come on.

121
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,460
Let me go!

122
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,860
Eat some food first.

123
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,700
Let's eat.

124
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,940
You make me feel sick.

125
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,220
I heard
that the tea factory is hiring workers.

126
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,340
I'll help you to apply for it later.

127
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,460
You won't need to go to school by then.

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,700
I'm not going to work in a factory!

129
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,940
I'm going to go to university!

130
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,580
University? Your father
didn't leave any money for you.

131
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,860
He only left you
with a butt load of debt.

132
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Who'll support you?

133
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
You're lying!

134
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,980
You can search the house
if you don't believe me.

135
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,220
The money will be yours if you find any.

136
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,620
The land in front of our house
and this house

137
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,820
all belong to the Nan family!

138
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,740
Why do you think

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,100
I would marry your alcoholic father
in the first place?

140
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,060
He was a useless fool.

141
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,940
It's all because

142
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
he said he would let me have this house.

143
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,220
I'll tell you this again.

144
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,340
Your father gave this house to me.

145
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,980
Don't even think about it.

146
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,740
You want to go to school?
In your dreams.

147
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,180
Hu Lifan.

148
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,700
What kind of era
do you think you're living in?

149
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,740
If you want to marry me,

150
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,860
you better be careful
when you fall asleep.

151
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,180
Because you'll never know

152
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,580
when I'm going to kill you.

153
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,620
Don't think of going anywhere today.

154
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,820
Let go of me!

155
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,460
What are you doing?

156
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,060
Let her go!

157
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,060
Do you believe that I'll find my father

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,620
and tell him to arrest you?

159
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,940
You little lass.

160
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,580
I know you were trying to act tough

161
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,820
in front of Hu Xiu.

162
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,980
Who wouldn't be sad
when their father died?

163
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,580
You can cry if you wish to.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,100
Actually,

165
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,820
I don't feel like crying at all.

166
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
At least,

167
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,860
I don't want to cry for him.

168
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,820
He's not a worthy father at all.

169
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,340
I will never shed a single tear for him.

170
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,060
Why is it so hard to live?

171
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,700
It won't be that hard

172
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,100
if you just think positively.

173
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,980
It's useless.

174
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I can't win against them.

175
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,980
I won't be able to go to university.

176
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,540
Time to eat.

177
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,060
Ling, Nan Ya, come and eat.

178
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,660
Don't cry.

179
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,620
Come on. Let's go and eat.

180
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,460
Don't cry.

181
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,580
Come on.

182
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
Nan Ya, come on.

183
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,620
Come, sit here.

184
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,460
In the future,

185

233
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,980
It'll take me at most five years.

with my undergraduate studies by then.

After that,

00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,300
I can even proceed
with my graduate studies.

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,020
Okay.

372
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,700
It's that person.

373
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:46,860
Okay.

374
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,180
Thank you.

375
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,380
Wait.

376
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,220
Mr. Zhang,

377
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,980
Happy National Day.

378
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,300
Didn't you go back?

379
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,260
No.

380

Mom wants you
to go home for dinner tonight.

381
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,060
It's gonna be something good for you.

382

She's arranging a blind date for you.
It's the factory's director.

383
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,260
I'm not going.

384
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,740
It's the factory's director.
You think he's not good enough?

385
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
He's less than 50 years old.

386
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,500
His family is wealthy too.

387
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,100
You'll lead a great life
if you get married to him.

388

If you dare to touch her again,

403
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,460
I'll make sure you get fired now!

404
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,140
Is your family
the owner of this factory?

405
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,540
Vice Director Zhou is my father's friend.

406
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,900
He even had dinner
at my house last week.

407
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,420
Do you want me to head to his office

408
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,660
and tell him
that you're harassing a female worker?

409
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,460
Go with me!

410
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,140
Let's go!

411

She's my younger stepsister.

412

Get away!

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm fine.

415
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,980
Do you truly know Vice Director Zhou?

416
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,420
I mean, it's not that difficult
if I want to make his acquaintance.

417
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,620
You were so cool

418
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,820
when you said that.

419
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,700
By the way,

420
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,220
do you need me
to make sure he gets fired?

421
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,820
No need for that.

422
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:48,980
You're right.

423
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,700
If you try to corner

424
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
a person like him,

425
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,420
maybe he'll do something
out of desperation.

426
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,140
That's true.

427
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,500
He had a criminal record before.

428
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
He'll still bully you

429

430
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,100
Why don't you live at my house?

431
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,780
At least, my father
can deal with him if he comes.

432
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,780
We can talk about that later.

celebrate the holiday yourselves.

Eat more, okay?

441
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,060
It's the holiday. Why not join us?

442

Goodbye.

443
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,660
If so, let's have lunch ourselves.

444
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,300

Where's Chen Ling?

449

She returned to work.

Didn't you two go to have lunch?

451
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,420
I just sent her there.

452
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,500
After that, I came to see you.

453
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,260
Well, Xu Yi,

454
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,500
I need to clarify something with you.

455
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Nan Ya, I have two movie tickets.

456
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,340
Xu Yi, listen to me first.

457
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,820
I don't care
for what reason you're doing this.

458
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Nothing's gonna happen between us.

459
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,860
Do you know why Hu Lifan
could blackmail me

460
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,620
time and time again?

461
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,180
It's because you kept pestering me

462
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,740
and sending me gifts.

463
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,700
He blackmailed me by saying
that he would tell Chen Ling about it.

464
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,340
I had no idea about that.

465
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,220

tells Chen Ling about it,

She and her family
have all treated me well.

When I was at my lowest moments,

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,620
Chen Ling was the one
who brought me home,

472

provided me with warm food,

to get hurt.

476

So, Nan Ya, are you refusing me
because you don't like me?

477
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,140
Or is it because you're worried
that you might hurt Chen Ling?

478
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,300
I don't like you at all.

479

Do you think all women
should revolve around you

It's fine if you're worried
that you might hurt Chen Ling.

00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,900
You deserve it.

555
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,660
You busybody!

556
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,660
How dare you stick your nose
into my business?

557
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,180
Hu Lifan, stop it!

558
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,380
Do you still dare to stick your nose
into my business?

559
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,260
Nan Ya is mine.

560
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
What did you say?

561
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Get over here!

562
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,140
Xu Yi.

563
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,900
Listen up.

564
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,260
I slept with her

565
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,020
when she was 17!

566
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,900
Back then,

567
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,380
your skin was very smooth.

568
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,540
Her skin was smooth and fine.

569
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,340
Plenty of people had slept with her!

570
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,940
She's a hussy!

571
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,860
You, the young master of the Xu family,

572
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,700
are actually tricked by a hussy like her?

573
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,540
Shut up!

574
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,540
Nan Ya.

575
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,820
Let's go.

576
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,580
I'll kill you!

577
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,660
I'll kill you!

578
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm going to kill you!

579
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,140
Xu Yi, run!

580
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,860
How dare you hit me?

581
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,980
