Nan Ya's case is a special case.

to a national key university.

is guilty?

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,780
Of course, she is.

34

I mean, she got one killed, after all.

So, will she receive
a reduced prison sentence?

that she was defending herself.

187
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,300
My dad was no match for him.

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,580
so he went into hiding.

189
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,580
Look at the date on the photo.

190
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,580
The date is correct, right?

191
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Of course. It's set automatically.

192
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,580
How did you know it was your dad's car?

193
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,780
Surely, I know my dad's
car plate number.

194
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,540
Liu,

195
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,220
what was the date that Xu Yi

196
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,460
made the report on Liu Changshui
absconding with the money?

197
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,460
November 30th.

198
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,220
The photo was taken on December 9.

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,140
Could it be that Liu Changshui
never left town?

200
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,220
Looks like it's a city.

201
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,420
Take this photo to run a check.

202
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,700
Find out which residential area it is.

203
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,380
Got it.

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,260
Officer Lin.

205
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,580
With what I have just told you,

206
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,220
can you count my dad
as turning himself in?

207
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,420
Officer Lin,

208
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,820
we've found the place shown
in Liu Xun's photo.

209
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,900
There weren't any traces
of Liu Changshui.

210
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,820
But Xu Yi had rented a room here.

211
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,740
Rented?

212
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,180
Yes. If it were bought, there would be
records in the Housing Authority.

213
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,220
He probably didn't want anyone to know.

214
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,700
Officer Lin.

215
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,260
Officer Lin.

216
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,700
How's it going?

217
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,420
These are all the company's ledgers.

218
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,340
They were well hidden.

219
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,100
So there must be
something wrong with them.

220
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,780
Anything unusual about the room?

221
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,060
In terms of the way it looks now,

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,620
someone must have cleaned it.

223
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,180
Liu,

224
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,700
come here.

225
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
Bring the ECU up to date.

226
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,580
Do a countywide investigation.

227
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Then, release the information
about Xu Yi's ledgers.

228
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,060
Let's see if that would
push Liu Changshui to turn himself in.

229
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Yes, sir.

230
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,460
Chen, Officer Lin, come have a look.

231
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
A woman's hair strand.

232
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,500
Chen.

233
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,220
This was found under the bed.

234
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,380
A woman's earring.

235
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,020
Are you the landlord?

236
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Yes.

237
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,180
Did a woman live here before?

238
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,500
I never saw any woman.

239
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,700
Not when I came to collect the rent.

240
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,580
Besides,

241
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,020
since I've rented it out,
it's none of my business who lives here.

242
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,820
Take a look.

243
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,020
This woman.

244
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,100
Have you seen her before?

245
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,940
No.

246
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Never.

247
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,500
[Purchase and requisition receipts]
By the ledgers found in the safe,

248
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,900
Xu Yi had been the mastermind
behind the bridge case.

249
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,060
[Materials ledger]
Through buying fake materials

250
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,460
and modifying construction processes
and costs,

251
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,060
he made a profit. Then,

252
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,140
[Materials ledger, Shengda Construction]
he carefully moved the money elsewhere

253
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,860
bit by bit
through numerous shell companies.

254
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,460
And ultimately, it's hidden somewhere

255
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,100
in the form of cash.

256
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
One more thing.

257
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,540
Judging from the hair
found in the gutter

258
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,980
and items left behind in the room,

259
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,300
Xu Yi was living with a woman there.

260
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,660
But after comparison,

261
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,780
it wasn't Nan Ya.

262
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,260
As for the woman,

263
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,140
she was kept a total secret.

264
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,420
Neither the landlord
nor the neighbors ever saw her.

265
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,300
On the bedroom door,

266
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,540
there were signs of it
being forced open.

267
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
But the culprit was very careful.

268
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,220
She did not leave any fingerprints

269
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,900
in the room.

270
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,340
Officer Lin,

271
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,460
let me make a wild guess.

272
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,900
Could it be that woman, after all?

273
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,740
I think it's someone else.

274
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,860
Xu Yi's bridge case

275
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,740
involved tens of millions of yuan
and had caused two deaths.

276
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,420
And he had long separated from Nan Ya.

277
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,460
And now, we've found
he had a secret lover.

278
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,300
Yes.

279
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,780
This is consistent
with Nan Ya's confession, then.

280
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,500
They secretly made changes to the plan
and cut corners.

281
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,620
That caused the half-built bridge
to collapse suddenly.

282
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,980
I told him I had proof.

283
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
And I used it as leverage
to get a divorce.

284
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,020
Xu Yi was afraid she'd report it,

285
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,140
so he tried to silence her.

286
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,300
That caused Nan Ya
to stab him in the panic

287
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,820
in self-defense.

288
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,060
The basic evidence, testimonies,
and the witness taken for Nan Ya's case

289
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,900
do not contradict her own description.

290
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,700
Xu Yi's motive for killing Nan Ya
has been established.

291
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,460
Thus, Nan Ya's killing in self-defense

292
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
should also be justified.

293
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,700
Any other doubts
regarding Xu Yi's autopsy

294
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,540
or the site investigation?

295
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,660
In the autopsy report,

296
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,980
aside from a slight alcohol overdose,

297
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,580
there were no other suspicious traces.

298
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,460
As for the stab wound on Xu Yi's chest,

299
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,900
the M. E. said it was a compound injury.

300
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,500
Regarding the crime scene,

301
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,860
because Xu Yi had abused Nan Ya
for a long time,

302
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,460
there was blood everywhere.

303
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,780
There is no doubt about it
for the time being.

304
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,220
Okay. Officer Lin,
prepare a report for me.

305
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,580
Let's do it properly. I'll submit
a request to the higher-ups.

306
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,580
That's all for today.
You may go, guys.

307
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,260
Chief,

308
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,380
in the past, such incidents

309
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,180
were treated as an excessive defense.

310
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,740
Well, Wang Yao. Sit down.

311
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,620
Times have changed.

312
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,700
We need to adapt how we think too.

313
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,020
The legal definition of criminal acts

314
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,180
will only become clearer
and more comprehensive.

315
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,860
Nan Ya was a victim of long-term abuse.

316
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,900
Plus, there was an eyewitness.

317
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,780
The media also seems to be
unanimously on her side.

318
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,860
The Provincial PSB also pays a lot
of attention to this case.

319
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,220
Then there's the Women's Federation,
requesting that we should

320
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,460
ensure that women's rights
are fully respected and protected.

321
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,700
Hence, the emotions
of the victim's family

322
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,980
must not influence us

323
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,660
to make sound judgments.

324
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,700
If it complies with the conditions,

325
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,380
then it should be processed as such.

326
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,060
I'll leave it to you then, Lin.

327
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,140
Get the report ready
as soon as possible,

328
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,140
and I'll promptly submit it, okay?

329
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,780
Yes, sir.

330
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,300

Regarding this case,

334
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,380
you seem to have

335
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,420
the utmost confidence.

336
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
No doubts at all?

337
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,180
In our first Criminal Law lesson,

338
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,180
the lecturer told us

339
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,420
about the presumption of innocence.

340
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,780
So you do have doubts.

343
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,540
Okay.

344
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,500
Have you eaten?

345
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,100
I'm waiting for you to eat together.

346
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,900
Why are you so late?

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,900
We're about to close the case.

348
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,540
What's the conclusion?

349
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,860
Justified self-defense.

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,860
Honestly, that makes me feel better.

351
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,980
For those women

who are victims of long-term abuse,

353
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,500
this is a good outcome.

I'm worried that my opinion on this case

358
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,780
involved too many personal feelings.

359
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,660
You sympathize with her?

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,500
affect you.

369
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,580
Swallow the frustration.

370
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
Once you get the admission,

371
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,820
you will live a different life.

372
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,500
I'll get the photos for my son first.

373
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,700
Talk to you later.

374
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,500
Boss.

375
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
Guixiang.

376
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,980
I'm here for Zhou Luo's photos.

377
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,140
Sure, just a minute.

378
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,180
They are ready, right?

379
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Yes, it is.

380
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,140
The photos are really nice.

381
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,940
Really?

382
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,380
Here you go.

383
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,620
Thanks.

384
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,260
No worries.

385
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,420
My son must be handsome.

386
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,380
Why are the photos like this?

387
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,860
What is it?

388
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,860
I'll do it again, Guixiang.
It won't take long.

389
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,860
I'm so sorry.

390
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,600
[Hey, can I ask you about someone?]
[Who?]

391
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,450
[Zhou Luo. He's also in Physics Dept.]
[The class of 1996? He was expelled.]

392
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,820
[Impossible.
He's a really good student.]

393
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,820
[Yeah, he ranked first in his class.]

394
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,700
[So how come?]

395
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,950
[A sex scandal.]

396
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,220
All right, that is all

397
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,020
about subjunctives today.

398
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,300
I want you all
to review carefully at home. Dismissed.

399
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,120
[That's interesting. What happened?]

400
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,270
[Nobody knows the details.
The school kept it hush.]

401
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,120
[He left quietly. I bet his family
are some big guns.]

402
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,400
[To the public, it was said
he dropped out due to illness.]

403
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,820
[However.]

404
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,820
[A 40-something-year-old female teacher
left at the same time.]

405
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,820
Liu Xun, what's that you're sticking?

406
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,660
What are you trying to do?

407
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Surprise, surprise.

408
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,420
So you're into middle-aged women.

409
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,660
You have a special taste.

410
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,540
So Zhang Qingli was wasting time

411
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,940
on you, since she wasn't your type.

412
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,980
Listen up.

413
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,140
No matter what kind of woman I like,

414
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,060
I can still get into Jinghua

415
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,660
while you can only stay in the dark
and get jealous.

416
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,900
Zhou Luo!

417
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:10,500
Zhou Luo!

418
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,620
So I'll make sure

419
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,940
you can't get into Jinghua
even with good scores.

420
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,460
He's not worth it.

421
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,260
Just you wait, Liu Xun!

422
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,660
Just let me beat up that crazy mutt!

423
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,860
Let's see how much longer
you guys can gloat.

424
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,980
Who's that woman in the photo?

425
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,980
Nobody.

426
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,220
An insignificant person.

427
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,780
Nobody? Then,
why did he stick it on the board?

428
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
Just forget about it.

429
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,100
Are you hiding something from me?

430
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,540
Is Mr. Chen cooking tonight?

431
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,700
I don't know.

432
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,900
My dad has been quite moody lately.

433
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,020
I think they're about
to conclude Nan Ya's case.

434
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,260
Is that so?

435
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,820
Did he mention the outcome?

436
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
No.

437
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,900
He won't say.

438
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,700
I really wish we could have

439
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,220
boiled pork slices for dinner tonight.

440
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
I really miss Mr. Chen's cooking.

441
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,700
You dare to make requests

442
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,500
while you won't answer any questions.

443
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
I'll go ask my dad to cook for you.

444
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,060
Here you go, Zhou Luo.
The pork slices you requested.

445
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,780
Let me have a taste too.

446
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,180
Delicious.

447
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,580
You know what, Zhou Luo?

448
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,820
The most delicious food in Qingshui Town

449
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,940
is found nowhere else

450
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,220
but in our house.

451
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,140
Right, Dad?

452
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,620
You only know about good food.

453
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,540
When will you ever be like Zhou Luo

454
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,500
and get into a university in Beijing?

455
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,300
That would certainly
make your dad and me super happy.

456
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
Can we not talk about that, Mom?

457
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,220
Besides...

458
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,300
Zhou Luo.

459
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,580
That night,

460
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,740
when you went to Nan Ya's house,

461
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,700
did you see what happened clearly?

462
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,380
Was Xu Yi really trying to kill Nan Ya?

463
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,420
Bro, what a surprise.

464
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,340
What's for dinner? I could smell
the deliciousness at the door.

465
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,100
Officer Lin, come and sit down.

466
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,420
Sit, sit.

467
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,660
Place it here. Sit beside me.

468
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,420
- Yes.
- Okay.

469
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,420
Get him a glass.

470
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,420
Okay.

471
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,060
Zhou Luo,

472
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,620
how come you're here?

473
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,060
Mr. Chen is a great cook.
I came for the good food.

474
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,300
Yes, it is good.

475
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,340
Here, dig in.

476
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:40,980
Thanks, Mrs. Chen.

477
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,260
I saw it clearly, Mr. Chen.

478
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,420
That day, Xu Yi was holding an axe.

479
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,380
He was chasing Nan Ya.

480
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,380
He slipped

481
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,500
and fell onto her.

482
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,940
When he got up, a knife
was stuck in his chest.

483
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,380
He started screaming then.

484
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,180
A while later, he fell on the ground

485
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,020
and never got up again.

486
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,380
Where were you when you saw

487
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,460
all those?

488
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
I was in the yard with a wooden stick.

489
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,180
I was going to charge in,

490
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,420
but my legs felt glued to the ground
when I saw what had happened.

491
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Did you shout?

492
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,660
Xu Yi had looked
awfully scary at the time.

493
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,700
Bro, try the pork slices my dad made.

494
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
They are really good.

495
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,380
Chen,

496
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,860
the boiled pork slices you made

497
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,100
are truly awesome. They are delicious.

498
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,140
Have more.

499
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,940
Bro, what's the verdict on Nan Ya?

500
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,140
That's why I'm here.

501
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,740
I've finished the report.

502
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,900
Give it a read after we're done eating.

503
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,060
You're a college graduate.

504
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,580
Just write it following
the higher-ups' instructions.

505
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,940
I don't have any other opinion about it.

506
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,540
Right now, I'm just worried

507
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,060
that the Xu Family
won't simply let this go.

508
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,740
If they're not satisfied,

509
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,700
they can file a complaint.

510
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,860
So you're really going to set her free?

511
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,540
She certainly is not an ordinary person.

512
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,420
She could even go scot free for murder.

513
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,860
Then I'll kill someone too
if I'm not in a good mood one day!

514
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,220
Chen Ling, stop talking nonsense!

515
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,420
- Ling.
- Ling.

516
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,740
Mom.

517
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,860
You sit down.

518
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,940
Go inside, Chen. It's cold.

519
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,100
What major are you planning to do?

520
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,620
Computer.

521
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,060
How come?

522
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,700
No particular reason.

523
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,420
Because the prospects are good.

524
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,500
You studied physics.

525
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,820
Your mom said you wanted
to get a PhD in Physics.

526
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
I got tired of studying it
and wanted to learn something else.

527
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,580
Then, are you planning to come back?

528
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,700
Nan Ya's case will be closed soon.

529
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,700
I think I can tell you

530
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,380
that because of your testimony,

531
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,700
she's likely to be sentenced
as justified self-defense.
