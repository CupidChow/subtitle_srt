Nan Ya?

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
I didn't see her.

10
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,460
I wasn't there
during the countdown to midnight.

11
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,940
And we're not close.

12
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,140
So I didn't pay attention
to what she was doing that night.

13
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
I went to see Zhou Luo.

14
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,620
But I didn't find him.

15
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,420
I guess we missed each other
on the road.

16
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,060
Why would I pay attention to her?

17
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,580
We know what kind of woman Nan Ya is.

18
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,980
She's got a bad reputation here.

19
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,380
Why would I get involved with her?

20
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,020
Nan Ya?

21
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't know her very well,

22
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,060
so I can't make any judgments.

23
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,300
But I do think

24
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,220
she's very pretty.

25
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,020
Really, really pretty.

26
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,660
Since we couldn't live a happy life,
we got divorced.

27
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,620
Nowadays,

28
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,140
divorce is not a big deal.

29
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,780
It's all about money.

30
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,500
Xu Yi isn't a good person.

31
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,340
But honestly,

32
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,260
when he was with me,

33
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,740
he never abused me.

34
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,500

Chen Ling and I
work at the same hospital.

37
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,500
It was the chief's idea

38
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,740
for us to go on a blind date.

39
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,980
However,

40
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,700
I care about my reputation.

41
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,620

47
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,500

He could make tons of money
by running the video store.

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,020
He was kicked out of the university.

53
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,260
If there's nothing wrong
with his character,

54
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,140
why would a smart student like him
be kicked out?

55
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,220

if he hadn't slipped,

63
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,980
Nan Ya would probably be dead.

64
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,020

96
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,780
His mom must be so worried about him.

104
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,340
He slept with a girl

116

It's because Zhou Luo was using drugs
and soliciting prostitutes.

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,020
Back then, it was a sham
that he got the highest grade.

118
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,740
He cheated.

119
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,940
So the school kicked him out.

120
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,940
I can't believe he did that.

121
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,380
That's immoral.

122
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,860
Anyway,

123
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,980
he won't be able to go to university.

You have to go to university.

Taking care of the store is just
wasting your talent on a petty job

Then what isn't petty?

142
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,540

I've been wanting to tell you,

151

but I'm worried you might think

152
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,220
it's humiliating.

I'll take care of his student status.

160
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,420
The school

161
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
only told him to quit.

162
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,820
So it's still possible for him
to continue studying.

163
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
My son

164
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,540
is talented.

165
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,580
If he retakes the exam,

166
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,020
he will be admitted
to a national key university again.

167
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,620
But the problem is

168
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,940
that it'd confirm
that it wasn't because of his illness.

169
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,940
Well then, what do you think

170

Without a bright future,

173
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,380

My dad sent me here.

208
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,660
He said I'd have to repeat the grade
until I pass the exam.

209

He had to go to school.

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,300

The way you're breezing through

257
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,140

His reputation is already ruined

271

and yet he doesn't keep it low.

272
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,340

316

Being a businesswoman means

317
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,260
I'll have more freedom
than what I have now.

318
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,220
But doing business means
you're still going to leave.

320
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,260
You guys are lucky to be free.

321
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,820
My dad said,

322
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,740
I'll have to keep repeating the grade
until I'm admitted to a top university.

323
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,620
Well, your dad is weird.

324
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,580
You'd already been admitted
to one university,

325
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,700
but he refused to let you go.

326
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,020
Otherwise,

327
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,260
you'd now be dating someone
in university.

328
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,540
Why didn't he let you go?

329
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,460
My dad said
it wasn't a first-tier university.

330
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,060
It was not worth it.

331
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,420
So he wanted me to repeat the grade.

332
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,740
What does he take me for?

333
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,900
It's only because he runs a cram school,

334
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,220
he sees my unsatisfactory grade

335
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,020
as humiliating.

336
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm just like a prisoner.

337
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,060
But, the more he pushes me,

338
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,420
the less I learn.

339
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,340

00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,140
why the three of us hang out together.

341
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,100
Because none of us likes studying.

Yeah.

347
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,420
Why did you come back?

348
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,460
Bingbing.

349
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,340
Why?

350
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,300
I'm just asking.

351
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,180
We're all friends now.

352
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,500
Actually, I didn't quit
because of illness.

353
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,340
I was kicked out.

354
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,580
Kicked out?

355
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,220
Why?

356
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,940
Why did...

357
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,900
he get kicked out?

358
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,060
Even if you were kicked out, so what?

359
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,180
If you don't stay here,

360
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,260
there's a place for you to stay.

361
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,940
Just go to a better school.

What do you want, Zhou Luo?

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,220
I'll have an ice pop.

421
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
Okay.

422
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,380
Qingli.

423
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,180
Ma'am.

424
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,860
Look.

425
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,420
A puppy.

426
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,900

to devour it.

427
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:45,780
Come here.

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,580
Come.

[Open]

430
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,300
Let's go.

431
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,380
Let me see.

432
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,220
Where's mine?

433
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,860
Does it hurt?

434
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,980
What are you doing?

435
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,740
Gosh.

436
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,700
Let's go, Zhou Luo.

437
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,820
He's so annoying.

438
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,900
Chen Jun.

439
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,940
Whose shop is that?

440
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,220
It's Nan Ya's.

441
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
How could you not know?

442
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,460
Let's go.

443
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,820
So cute.

444
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,340
Come on.

445
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,420
Qingli.

446
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,140
You're back.

447
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Go and wash up.

448
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,900
Where have you been?

449
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,500
Well...

450
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,300
I had a few questions I couldn't solve.

451
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,140
So I went to ask Zhou Luo.

452
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,940
He taught you how to solve them?

453
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,180
That's good.

454
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,940
In the future,

455
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,660
you should communicate
with students like Zhou Luo.

456
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,380
Man struggles upwards, you know?

457
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,180
Don't waste your time
with people like Chen Jun.

458
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,340
What's he good for?

459
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,540
That's enough.

460
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,660
Go wash up. Go.

461
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,020
I'm not wasting my time.

462
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,020
Don't always be nagging at her.

463
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,380
Zhou Luo

464
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,940
is able to bear such a big thing

465
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,220
at his age.

466
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,820
He's really something.

467
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,380
All right.

468
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,900
You're always saying Zhou Luo is awesome

469
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,900
and capable.

470
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,940
You might as well take him as your son.

471
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,140
I have a duty to send him
into a prestigious university,

472
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,940
the top university in Beijing.

473
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,220
If Zhou Luo once again
gets a good grade on the exam,

474
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,180
then Huashan Cram School
will be known far and wide.

475
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,660
Then, I'd ask the government
for a piece of land

476
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,140
to build our own campus.

477
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,900
Nice try.

478
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,700
Who's going to invest in you?

479
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,980
Well, Xu Yi is interested in it.

480
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,980
Xu Yi?

481
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,220
Really?

482
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Nan Ya came to see me today.

483
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,580
She said,

484
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,820
when I restock in the future,

485
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,500
get her some needles,
threads and fabrics.

486
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,220
Don't get too close to her.

487
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,780
We wouldn't want to get into trouble.

488
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,380
I just feel bad for Wanwan.

489
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,140
She's still a kid,

490
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,820
yet she's very ill.

491
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,140
So poor.

492
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,380
What kind of trouble
will buying goods cause?

493
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,620
You don't know.

494
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,460
The word in town is

495
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,820
that she's making clothes

496
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,740
for women who are involved
in that kind of business.

497
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,980
Did they see it themselves?

498
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,700
Why would she know those women?

499
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,020
That's true.

500
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,140
If you ask me,

501
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,580
she and her daughter
are quite polite.

502
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,260
It's no trouble at all helping them

503
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,300
buy some goods.

504
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,740
For a woman

505
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,820
to have such a bad reputation,

506
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,500
I reckon someone is deliberately
smearing her name.

507
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,340
I think so too.

508
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,220
Nan Ya

509
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
is so shameless.

510
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,940
She would

511
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,460
hook up with any men.

512
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,300
Her clothing store

513
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
can barely sell any clothes.

514
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,740
I wouldn't wear such clothes
even if they were free.

515
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,940
Indeed.

516
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,580
I mean,

517
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,100
those clothes are for women
who seduce men.

518
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,260
You're right about that.

519
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,980
Do you know Xu Yi's friend?

520
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,660
His wife went to Nan Ya's shop
to get custom-made clothes.

521
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,300
While the wife

522
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,020
was getting changed...

523
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,620
I'll take this.

524
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
She grabbed the man's hand.

525
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,700
She even seduced her husband's friend?

526
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,060
Unbelievable, right?

527
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,620
She's just like Pan Jinlian.
[*A notorious woman in a Chinese novel]

528
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,500
That's right.

529
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,860
I won't be surprised

530
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,820
if she poisoned Xu Yi one day.

531
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,700
Exactly.

532
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,380
How shameless.

533
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,780
Yeah.

534
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,660
That Nan Ya...

535
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,460
She's so shameless.

536
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,700
She really has no shame.

537
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,620
Nan Ya.

538
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,140
Where did you go?

539
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,380
I went to the market
to buy some vegetables.

540
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,140
Did the fruit stall's owner, Liu,
give you freebies again?

541
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,460
Alas, we're not that fortunate.

542
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,660
He complained a lot

543
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,340
just because I asked for free coriander.

544
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,900
Liu won't allow himself
to suffer losses.

545
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,340
He wouldn't give stuff for free.

546
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,300
Do you think she heard us?

547
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,020
Even if she did, so what?

548
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,780
Just look at her being coquettish.

549
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,900
Who is she doing that for?

550
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,260
Yeah.

551
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,260
Sir.

552
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,780
Sir, is mine done?

553
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,820
Sir!

554
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Oh my god!

555
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,260
What's going on?

556
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,580
This tape you're playing.

557
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,580
Is there more in the store?

558
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,620
That's the only one.

559
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,420
And it's very old.

560
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,620
Next time when you restock,

561
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,460
could you help me get another one?

562
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,940
Do you like the song?

563
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,500
Do I not look like the type
who would like this song?

564
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,300
No,

565
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,900
it's just...

566
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,420
Not many people in this town
like rock music.

567
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,380
It sounds good
when I hear you playing it.

568
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,740
Well, I really like this band.

569
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,860
The music they write,

570
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,740
the style and the lyrics are all...

571
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,580
special...

572
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,260
Is there anyone who can fix this?

573
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,460
Well...

574
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,020
Let me try.

575
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,820
Does it often get stuck?

576
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,780
Not really.

577
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,740
Just a few times.

578
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,220
When it starts sounding weird,

579
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,460
I quickly take it out.

580
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,940
Or else it's going to get all tangled.

581
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,940
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,900
It's nothing serious.

583
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,500
But I can't fix it right away.

584
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,020
Why don't you leave it here for now?

585
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,780
You can get it back later.

586
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,940
Okay.

587
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,460
Thanks.

588
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,820

594

595
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,460
Thank you, Guixiang.

Bye, Wanwan.

Goodbye.

601
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,700
You think I won't kill you?

602
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:41,940
You dare run?

603
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,540
You wench!

604
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,100
Speak up.

Were you fooling around with him?

607
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,460
Did you sleep together?

608

How dare you?

609
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,740
How dare you cheat on me?

Wench!

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,020
I'll satisfy you.

612
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,460
I'll give you what you want.

613

Let...

614
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,220

617
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
Yes.

618
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,460
Dismissed.

619
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,660
Did your dad answer
a police call last night?

620
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,300
About Xu Yi and Nan Ya?

621
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Yeah.

622
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,860
As an officer,

623
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,060
he's been resolving marital conflicts
in Qingshui Town all day.

624
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,140
Why did he need to solve it?

625
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,780
Because they made a big scene.

626
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,620
How did he solve it?

627
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,060
They probably managed to calm them down.

628
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,300
Do you know what she said
at the police station?

629
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,940
She accused Xu Yi of rape

630
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,180
and wanted him in jail.

631
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,380
Are you serious?

632
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,140
Maybe it's a joke
between husband and wife.

633
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,820
I've got to hand it to Nan Ya.

634
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,780
A martial conflict led
to a visit to the police station,

635
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,740
and she adamantly called
for her husband's arrest.

636
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,260
A woman can't possibly overpower a man.

637
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,700
Was she supposed to just take it
and be beaten to death?

638
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,060
I'll say this.

639
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,980
It's wrong for a man to hit a woman.

640
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,220
I agree with this.

641
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
But,

642
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,060
if the woman

643
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,380
had cheated on the man,

644
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,300
I don't think

645
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,060
any man would be able to bear it.

646
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,460
I guess Xu Yi was already
sent over the edge.

647

Does your sister know

648
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,460
you're taking Xu Yi's side?

649

Your guess was right.

664
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,260
It was arson.

666
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,580
so much hatred for Xu Yi?

667
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,180
I heard

668

you moved into Zhou Luo's house.

669
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,300
They happened to have a vacant room.

to look after Wanwan.

672
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,820
Are you suspecting Zhou Luo?

No.

Nothing wrong with his character.

If you're talking about
the most promising resident in Qingshui,

679
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,780
Zhou Luo has to be the one

680
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,180
in his generation.

681
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,580
He was top of the class every year.

682

At the college entrance exam,

683
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,860
he got the highest grade
in Yishan County that year.

684
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,860
The student with the highest grade?

685
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,700
Why did he repeat a year, then?

686
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,300
He was asked to quit.

687
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,740
On the surface,

688
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,980
he quit because of illness.

689
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,580
But in fact,

690
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,740
he was kicked out.

691
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,580
Just that the school gave him a way out.

692
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,020
What was the reason?

693
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,460
I don't know the reason.

Nobody knows why.

695

a lot of bad words about it.

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,500

nor explain anything.

00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,100
What do you think?

752
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,140
"Deception is an exact science".

753
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,620
This one looks good.

754
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,380
Sleep early.

755
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,380
You dare escape?

756
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,740
No way!

757
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,740
Believe it or not,
I'll drown you right here!

758
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,340
You want to escape?

759
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,260
I was only gone for two days
and you couldn't stand it?

760
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,780
Did you sleep with him?

761
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,300
Couldn't stand being lonely, huh?

762
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,060
Get over here.

763
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,140
I'll satisfy you.

764
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,300
I'll give you what you want.

765
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,660
Speak up.

766
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,340
Were you two fooling around?

767
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,580
Were you fooling around with him?

768
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,340
You can sleep with others,
but you don't want to sleep with me.

769
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,180
I did not!

770
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,340
Let me go!

771
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,140
Let me go!
