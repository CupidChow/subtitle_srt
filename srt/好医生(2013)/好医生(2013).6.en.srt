06:59:59,000 --> 06:59:58,823
<i>Good Doctor</i>

2
00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:03,216
<i>Episode 6</i>

3
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,873
Doctor Park!

4
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:13,525
Hey!

5
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,650
Hey!

6
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,636
You're a good girl, right?

7
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:07,454
You said your name was Eun Ok, right?

8
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:11,868
Eun Ok, we'll make it so that you won't be in pain anymore so. . .

9
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,559
Oh my!

10
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,394
Doctor!

11
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,453
What's going on?

12
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,244
Her condition is kind of unique.

13
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,924
Even so, you can't even handle one child?

14
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:33,763
No. . . she's really strong.

15
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:37,349
She bites and she smells.

16
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:38,327
Doesn't she understand?

17
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:42,679
Yes, we can't communicate with her.

18
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,079
Grab her.

19
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,784
Pardon?

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,816
Hong Gil Nam,

21
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,160
Lorazepam 1ml ampule.<br>[Psychotropic drug considered a sedative, a strong anti-anxiety drug; highly addictive]

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,350
Yes.

23
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,832
It's too strong. It would be too much for the child.

24
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:23,608
We need to calm her down in order to examine her.

25
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:25,253
I will try to calm her down.

26
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:26,946
Do you want to get more injured?

27
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,929
It's alright. I will try one more time.

28
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,954
That's enough.

29
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:33,731
Here it is.

30
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:46,096
Doctor Park, what are you doing?

31
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:42,224
Countdown...

32
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:43,830
Wait...

33
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,962
Let's wait.

34
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:48,918
Start.

35
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,383
1. . .

36
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,041
2. . .

37
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,314
3! Grab her! Hey!

38
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:13,892
Hold her correctly!

39
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:16,442
Le..Lea..Leave her alone

40
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,538
Just let her be. Just. . . let her be.

41
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:14,161
Did the pediatric hospital do a basic assessment?

42
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:18,654
They couldn't communicate so they couldn't do a thorough examination.

43
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:23,706
When they found rubefaction [<i>redness</i>] around the naval area<br> they contacted us first.

44
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:41,992
Are you possibly the guardian?

45
00:05:41,992 --> 00:05:43,947
Yes, for the time being, I am.

46
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:44,786
For the time being?

47
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:48,888
Oh yes. The guardian is section chief Oh Han Sook from the child protection agency.

48
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:52,816
He got a report of child abuse and went out to rescue but...

49
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:57,772
I will listen to the details later.

50
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,255
Okay.

51
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:01,327
Do the blood test then do the abdominal sonography.

52
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,890
Do the abdominal CT if it's necessary.

53
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,632
Doctor Cha, hurry and administer an antibiotic.

54
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,620
Yes, I will proceed quickly and report back.

55
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:35,907
It's a relief it didn't get torn.

56
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,582
It seems like a dog bit you.

57
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:43,615
Earlier why did you crawl and approach to Eun Ok?

58
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:46,566
Animal communication.

59
00:06:46,566 --> 00:06:49,031
You really do know your profession.

60
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:51,568
Then you tried to get down on the eye level with animal,

61
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:53,416
that's why you crawled?

62
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:57,566
To be more precise, it was to match the frequency.

63
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:58,887
The frequency?

64
00:06:58,887 --> 00:06:59,785
Yes.

65
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,117
By aligning the human heart and the animal heart<br>in a direct line,

66
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,640
we have to combine the magnetic field surrounding<br>the animal heart

67
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,948
and the magnetic field surrounding human heart.

68
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,214
That's how we enable a good communication.

69
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:12,955
That's the first principal of animal lessons.

70
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:16,536
The heart has the most electrical currents in our body.

71
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,203
It's approximately 100 times the current that flows through the brain.

72
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:20,755
That's why if you concentrate on the heart...

73
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,542
That's enough.

74
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:28,482
I know what you mean but don't do that in front of the Professor or the others.

75
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:32,885
And you. . .

76
00:07:33,826 --> 00:07:36,208
For a man's arm, what is this?

77
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,366
About as big as a toothpick...

78
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,817
You should do some exercise.

79
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,363
Since yesterday, why are you always having hiccups?

80
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,572
Are you not feeling well?

81
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,341
It's not like that. It's. . . not like that.

82
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,594
How can they just unilaterally stop the sponsorship?

83
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,020
And for no reason.

84
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,461
Why wouldn't there be a reason?

85
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:15,921
Isn't Seongwon foundation's mismanagement public knowledge?

86
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:19,775
Though our foundation isn't what it used to be in the past,<br>we don't have poor management.

87
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,685
You just don't get it.

88
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:25,805
Go out and listen to the rumors.

89
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,793
You're talking as if it's someone else's business.

90
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:32,953
General Manager Yoo, how could you say that.

91
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,474
Was I talking about someone else's business?

92
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,414
You've always been like that.

93
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:38,365
Please calm down.

94
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:42,699
The time for wasteful bickering is past.

95
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:48,310
This may impact more supporting organizations other than Omyeong Group.

96
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,151
I think we should shore up any potentially problematic issues at the hospital first.

97
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:58,827
For instance, I mean any trivial medical treatment disputes<br> or guardians' protests.

98
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:04,064
Doesn't this situation make the hospital finances become more grave?

99
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,484
In addition, Woomyeong Group is

100
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:10,110
the company that provided the most support for our hospital.

101
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:19,536
I see the implication of this on the foundation but<br> the hospital must take certain measures internally.

102
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,829
Specifically, what internal measures did you have in mind?

103
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,516
For one, combining the hard-to-run departments

104
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:27,222
or splitting them up.

105
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:30,838
Currently, the only department showing loss on profit<br>is the pediatric surgical unit.

106
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:36,168
Instead of keeping the department to struggle along as is,<br> it may best to send it to the Ulsan branch.

107
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:39,192
Because there isn't any pediatric surgical unit currently,

108
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:42,205
so many patients will flood in.

109
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,967
I didn't realize we had that sort of option. I'm sure<br>that is also something the regional branch would wish as well.

110
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,676
We will decide upon it later.

111
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,384
One thing more important than that is to eliminating<br> excess manpower.

112
00:09:56,384 --> 00:10:00,883
I'm talking about the manpower that falls short in<br>meeting our hospital's standard.

113
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:04,184
We are not in the situation to discuss that.

114
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,648
But the patients' guardians are submitting their complaints about doctors

115
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,336
to the foundation.

116
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,952
I already told you clearly that we are not in the situation to discuss that.

117
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:45,439
Rescue Group also

118
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:48,145
notified us that they'll quit sponsoring.

119
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:58,858
First, in the pediatrics and psychiatric departments, precise diagnosis about

120
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,213
basic physical and emotional development is needed.

121
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:05,516
And the tests indicate that Eun Ok has malformed urachus (undegenerated tube btwn bladder and navel causes infection)

122
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:07,408
Secondly, infection has caused complications.

123
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,665
there's a small pustule below the belly button.

124
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:12,767
There will be no impediment to life, right?

125
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,244
Malformed urachus itself is not life-threatening.

126
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:19,165
Because we just need to remove the open duct through surgery.<i> [to stop the draining of urine to the navel area]</i>

127
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:22,654
Fortunately, the pustule is not big, so, after administering antibiotics,

128
00:11:22,654 --> 00:11:25,022
if it progresses well, we'll perform a surgery right away.

129
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,086
Also, where is the guardian?

130
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:32,140
Ah, yes. There are no parents <br>and the aunt is the guardian.

131
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,472
She's being investigated by the police.

132
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:38,752
Please give us some explanation <br>as to why Eun Ok is that way.

133
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:43,118
That aunt... She owns a dog farm.

134
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,322
It seems she was raising the child in the kennels.

135
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:49,690
When I went there after receiving the report,<br>she was with the dogs there.

136
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:53,731
Even for me, it was my first time<br> seeing that kind of child abuse.

137
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:55,804
How... that young child...?

138
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:57,461
For the present,

139
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:01,430
stabilizing the child physically and mentally is most important.

140
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,416
What do they say in the psychiatric department?

141
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:53,639
They say it's a typical reactive attachment disorder.

142
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,687
It's similar to autism,

143
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,613
and the object of the attachment

144
00:12:57,613 --> 00:13:00,494
seems to be the dogs she was with at home, they say.

145
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,306
There's an isolation room in our ward, isn't there?

146
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,866
Yes, there is.

147
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,997
Who says you can come in<br> without even knocking?!

148
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,243
I'm... I'm sorry.

149
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,922
What's the matter?

150
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:19,267
I... Eun Ok's attending physician,

151
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,095
I'd like to do it.

152
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:24,268
I would like to treat her, stuck to her 24 hours a day.

153
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,385
You! You should tell me that first.

154
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,329
What are we supposed to do if you <br>behave abruptly like this to the professor?

155
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:37,254
We mustn't keep giving her Lorazepam <br>to reduce her pain and to sedate her.

156
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:39,403
If she falls into a deep sleep,<br> she'll become even more anxious.

157
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,161
It's more distressing.

158
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,747
Because animals' sleeping patterns <br>are different from people's...

159
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:46,277
Park Si On

160
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,909
This is not the Department of Psychiatry <br>but the Department of Pediatric Surgery.

161
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,242
Yes, I know.

162
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:56,416
But, because Eun Ok cannot speak, she<br> needs someone who can communicate with her.

163
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,561
You're saying that you can do that, right?

164
00:13:58,561 --> 00:13:59,745
Yes.

165
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:03,119
When I was young, I talked with Rabbit too.

166
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,871
Sympathizing with animals is not difficult for me.

167
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:08,450
Animal's wavelength maintains theta waves,

168
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,694
so if humans focus and match the waves...

169
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:12,870
Cha Yoon Seo.

170
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,062
Assign Hong Gil Nam as Eun Ok's attending physician.

171
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,322
I... Professor.

172
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,437
I can do well too. <br>I can definitely (take good care) of Eun Ok...

173
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:22,382
Get out.

174
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,322
Get out!

175
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,331
Well, I also think that Eun Ok

176
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,828
was a little friendly to Dr. Park...

177
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:38,581
You get out too.

178
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:41,454
Can't you hear me tell you to get out?

179
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:57,828
You really don't listen, for s**t!

180
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:01,448
I told you not to bring that up <br>in front of the professor, didn't I?

181
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:06,398
And you! Will you continue <br>to treat Eun Ok like a dog?!

182
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,454
The disorder that Eun Ok currently experiences is...

183
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:13,071
Reactive attachment disorder. Siberian Wolf Girl. Bird Sound Boy. Vanya Yudin...

184
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,244
You know it well already!

185
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,001
Then, you should treat as you learned from the book!

186
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:22,894
An illness of the heart can't be treated by the book.

187
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,998
My illness also didn't get treated by the book.

188
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:30,779
The Director was always with me.

189
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,073
He became a friend to me.

190
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,767
Eun Ok can't speak, can she?

191
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,895
We can't know what she herself <br>wants or wants to say.

192
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,231
Still, it's possible to know.

193
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:44,606
What it is that Eun Ok hopes for.

194
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:53,354
Yes, Head Nurse.

195
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,485
Yae Eun did?

196
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:58,432
Tell us once more.

197
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,348
What hurts where how?

198
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,943
So...

199
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:04,566
Here, it - ang cheung ang cheung

200
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,932
and wung wung - hurts like that.

201
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:10,539
-Ang cheung ang cheung, wung wung?<br>-Ever since a few days ago,

202
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,598
she keeps being like this.

203
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:15,168
Based on the results, there's nothing wrong.

204
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:18,038
Then, is there a different problem?

205
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:19,987
She's not vomiting.

206
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:24,228
And she's passing gas easily and<br> doing her number two (bowel movements) well.

207
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,015
She's eating well too.

208
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,357
There's nothing that could be a problem.

209
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:30,941
Perhaps,

210
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,713
after being ang cheung ang cheung wung wung,

211
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:37,360
at night, doesn't it go woong woong ang geul angeul?

212
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,015
Yes, you're right! You're right!

213
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,744
At night, woong woong ang geul ang geul,

214
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:44,987
goo-roo-roong goo-roo-roong, it hurts like that.

215
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:48,659
If it goes goo-roo-roong goo-roo-roong, <br>at night, you don't fall asleep easily either, right?

216
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:51,475
Yes, you're right!

217
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:54,207
What on earth are you two talking about?

218
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,670
Based on the process of recovery of wounds in the operated area,

219
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,405
as new blood vessels are created and collagen accumulates,

220
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,981
it's all because the wound has healed.

221
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:05,817
That's why it's itchy and tickles inside.

222
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,151
Particularly, at night, her senses become acute.

223
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:11,444
So she's experiencing what feels like pain.

224
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:17,000
Is what this doctor's saying right?

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,166
Yes, there's that possibility.

226
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,445
However, there's no severe pain.

227
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:25,285
So I'll keep an eye on her condition and continue to observe her.

228
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,392
Hur...

229
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,283
Doctor!

230
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:44,545
Thank you for understanding what I was saying.

231
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:48,729
Last time too, thank you.

232
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,574
If you have a girlfriend, share it with her.

233
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:07,275
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Pediatron Team @ Viki</i>

234
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,908

235

<i>Thank you so much.</i>

236
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:19,365
<i>For growing up so well like this.</i>

237
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,598
Check Woo Young's urination and feed him milk in 20-cc portions.

238
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:27,352
You stick with him and check them for about a week.

239
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:28,832
Yes, I understand.

240
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:32,155
Eat well!

241
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,064
What is this?

242
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:40,233
Ah, this, she brought it from the staff cafeteria.

243
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,856
For the doctors and us to eat.

244
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:52,640
Why have I seen nothing of Hong Gil Nam, that kid? <br>He's not even coming into the operating room.

245
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,752
Gil Nam's taken on being the attending physician for the girl like a dog, so he's a little...

246
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,604
out of his mind.

247
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,058
Ah, that kid who came in

248
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:01,435
having suffered abuse? Was it the malformation of urachus?

249
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,322
Yes.

250
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:06,020
But we can't communicate with her or restrict her.

251
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,523
I'm really worried that an accident will occur.

252
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,266
Until the surgery, that's why they should have<br> left her at the Psychiatry Department.

253
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,650
Why are they keeping her in our hospital ward?

254
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,474
Ah, you are here.

255
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:17,439
Ah, yes.

256
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:23,726
Park Si On's complaint case, <br>that's been decided as not having happened.

257
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:25,351
What?!

258
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,250
Why is that?

259
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,865
You know that we've had, one after another, businesses stopping sponsorship, don't you?

260
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:34,278
If internal hospital matters become known to the outside,

261
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:36,504
the situation will become worse, so that's why.

262
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:39,539
Even if that's so, do you know hard I worked to create that opportunity?

263
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,953
The complaint case

264
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,942
was something that Executive Director Lee told you, Chief, to attempt. Wasn't it?

265
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,735
It's fine to play foul without my knowledge.

266
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:53,459
But you should have succeeded tidily.

267
00:19:54,104 --> 00:19:56,324
Even if we were to fold,

268
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:57,959
the guardians will not stay still.

269
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,976
That, I already tidied it up.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,704
I already took care of that.

271
00:20:01,704 --> 00:20:06,363
Fortunately, I dealt well with the guardians.

272
00:20:06,363 --> 00:20:12,750
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Pediatron Team @Viki.</i>

273
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:18,105
Branch?

274
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:21,282
It's what was brought up during the meeting.

275
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:26,259
According to Chief Kim, there is a great demand for patients,

276
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,634
but it's nothing like that based on the research.

277
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:34,385
In other words, a series of moves to eliminate Pediatric Surgery naturally at the branches?

278
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:38,097
What on earth is the relationship between<br> stopping sponsorship and Pediatric Surgery?

279
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:40,750
Are you really asking because you don't know?

280
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,510
If there's a problem with finances,

281
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:46,873
they'll withdraw support starting with the pediatric surgery deptartment which is has a deficit.

282
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,941
Then, it would disappear like that.

283
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:53,252
Pediatric orthopedic surgery department, Pediatric thoracic surgery department, Pediatric psychiatric department.

284
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,396
Every year, it's always been reduced and disappeared in that order.

285
00:20:56,396 --> 00:20:58,679
If you look at the micro-level, it may look like a Pediatric Surgery problem,

286
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,918
but you also know well that it's not that.

287
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:05,723
The board members of the foundation are using Park Si On to bring the Director down.

288
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:11,113
What's worse is that you've become Deputy Chief Kim's target.

289
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:13,967
Who is the actual influence of our hospital.

290
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:20,891
The Director, Park Si On, you

291
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:25,425
and the Pediatric Surgery Department, all have become the target.

292
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:29,078
Let them do whatever they want.

293
00:21:29,078 --> 00:21:30,662
I'll just go on my own path.

294
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:34,127
If you had quit working at the pediatric surgery department when I told you to do so,

295
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,291
you wouldn't have gotten involved in this kind of situation.

296
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:42,139
Please listen to me today even if you are displeased. <br> I can't leave you alone like this.

297
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,500
No matter what, I will make you the best, with my own hands.

298
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm not a person who is made by someone else. <br> I will do it on my own.

299
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:54,712
You can't be content with being a skilled surgeon.<br>You have to look at a bigger picture and-

300
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,158
Chae Gyeong.

301
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,786
For just once,

302
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,784
can't you feel proud of what I do?

303
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:05,726
I live with that.

304
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:11,089
Not ego, but pride.

305
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:26,059
Omo, poor thing. What's up with her face?

306
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,536
Ah, this odor. How could a child smell like this?

307
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:32,073
I lost my olfactory sense due to this odor.

308
00:22:32,073 --> 00:22:34,312
Before she goes, we should wash her.

309
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,385
Nurse Kim and Nurse Lee.

310
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:37,742
Yes? Are we doing it?

311
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,572
Am I doing it then?

312
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:42,669
If she suddenly comes in contact with water, she will wake up and get scared.

313
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:46,744
Doctor Park, don't distract us. Just stay still.

314
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,516
Chief Nurse,

315
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:51,435
we would do it if we could, but

316
00:22:51,435 --> 00:22:54,252
I think it will be too much for us.

317
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:58,876
It would be good if I could do it,<br> but because she's a full-grown girl...

318
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:03,012
Forget it everyone. You are all weak...

319
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:14,782
Senior! Senior! <br> Senior!!! Ah!

320
00:23:14,782 --> 00:23:20,045
SENIOR!<br>S-E-N-I-O-R!

321
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,459
Chief Nurse!

322
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,601
<i>Communication is not possible and control is also totally impossible.</i>

323
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:38,999
<i>I'm worried that there may be an accident .</i>

324
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,593
That's right.

325
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:44,809
I will finish it right this time.

326
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:52,019
Chae Gyeong. You know that Chairman's having a very hard time right now, don't you?

327
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,425
It's none of my business.

328
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:56,366
Why is it none of your business?

329
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:59,853
Even if you are displeased with her, being there for her at difficult times,

330
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:02,473
that's what family is.

331
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:08,515
Do you know whom I've come to<br> dislike even more than the Chairman?

332
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:11,386
Right. Director.

333
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:14,669
No, it's you, Ahjussi.

334
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,641
Maybe not anyone else,

335
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:23,419
I thought you would disapprove of my father's remarriage.

336
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:27,901
Because you were the one who understood me the most.

337
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:33,604
Their happiness was as important as my understanding of you at the time.

338
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:38,249
Because of their happiness,

339
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,397
my pain was ignored.

340
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,477
Chae Gyeong.

341
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:44,488
The Chairman, who was like my real aunt,

342
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,709
Director, who was like my real uncle,

343
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:53,199
at that time, <br> I felt like I had everything if you two were with me.

344
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,613
Because you two meant more than a family to me,

345
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,842
and you were the only "prop".

346
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:03,401
There is no change to the fact that we are your family.

347
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:10,314
With an excuse of being family, Ms. Lee Yeo Won gained the entire Seongwon foundation for herself.

348
00:25:10,314 --> 00:25:13,370
For the stability of the foundation, there was no choice.

349
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,606
I will get it back.

350
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:19,827
Both the foundation and my self-respect.

351
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:25,618
There she is.

352
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,883
Hey, you kids.

353
00:25:29,882 --> 00:25:32,375
You shouldn't steal a glance at the girl.

354
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:36,884
The girl in there might feel bad. Understand?

355
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:39,051
Yes.

356
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,413
Let's go.

357
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:58,766
Eun Ok, let's get into your bed. Okay?

358
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:03,342
Yeah, Eun Ok. It's very cushiony and nice.

359
00:26:04,294 --> 00:26:08,316
She must be out of her mind due to the drugs.

360
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:20,535
D- Doctor Park, what are you doing right now...?

361
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,729
Tie up Eun Ok's hands and feet, <br>and put a safeguard inside her mouth.

362
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:46,211
Why, how come do we completely tie the child up?

363
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:48,851
Eun Ok is about to have a surgery soon.

364
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:52,991
If she has a seizure and gets hurt, the area where the surgery is going to be conducted might get worse.

365
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:54,910
And the risk of self-inflicted injury is high, too.

366
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,728
Then, we need to consult with the psychiatry department first.

367
00:26:57,728 --> 00:27:00,858
The order is from Psychiatric Professor Song, not from me.

368
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:03,215
Quickly tie her up.

369
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:05,097
If she can't move, she will feel more pain.

370
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:06,176
It will be more painful.

371
00:27:06,176 --> 00:27:07,722
Who told you to stay here?

372
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:10,397
We have to pet her. We have to sleep with her in our arms.

373
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:13,822
Stop the nonsense and get out!

374
00:27:23,912 --> 00:27:24,895
Yes.

375
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:30,064
<i>Professor Kim. Change the attending physician of Lee Eun Ok to Doctor Park Si On.</i>

376
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:31,934
What?

377
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:40,152
Why, I hear she has pseudo-autism or something like that.

378
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:44,494
Since Park Si On has experienced a similar disability, <br>he would be helpful for her treatment.

379
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,395
It's already decided to be Hong Gil Nam.

380
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:51,327
What's the matter when it's the Chief switching the position?

381
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:53,346
What's your intention for doing it exactly?

382
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:55,177
What do you mean by "intention"?

383
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:56,588
Of course it's for a patient's treatment.

384
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:59,132
Is it that you want Park Si On to create a bigger problem?

385
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:01,968
What on earth... It's ridiculous.

386
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:02,865
Don't jump to conclusions.

387
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:05,846
I'm not jumping to conclusions but I don't feel your sincerity.

388
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:09,295
So are you saying that you are going to ignore a Chief's order?

389
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:11,420
Do you want to go to the Legal Committee again?

390
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,766
If I need to, I should.

391
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,960
Don't you know the hospital's current state?

392
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,314
The future of Pediatric Surgery is all dark clouds. <br>Nothing's apparent for a long time.

393
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:23,170
But, by continuing to cause problems, <br> will you make yourself be brought up in a complaint?

394
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,964
Professor Kim, your behaving this way<br> is of no good for the Director.

395
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:38,862
What should we do?

396
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:41,027
Assign Park Si On to the task.

397
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:45,175
You also wanted it.

398
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:48,337
I'm not comfortable if you say it like that.

399
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:51,532
So what am I supposed to do?

400
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:06,549
Are you happy that you became Eun Ok's attending physician?

401
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,405
Yes.

402
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:11,870
Come here.

403
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:20,009
You have to be really careful and do it well.

404
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,013
You can't do it wrong. Never.

405
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:27,216
This might be your last chance.

406
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,797
Okay.

407
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:33,076
Like holding on to the rope doing a tug of war,

408
00:29:33,076 --> 00:29:36,356
on an elementary school field day.

409
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,522
You have to pay all your attention to do it. Understand?

410
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,884
I have faith in you.

411
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,882
I really do believe in you.

412
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,830
By the way, <br>why do you keep hiccuping whenever you see me?

413
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,820
Do you feel like throwing up when you see me?

414
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,125
N-

415
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,501
No, I don't.

416
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:11,965
Ah, right.

417
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,169
What is this?

418
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:24,321
Well... It's just...

419
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,689
It's...

420
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:31,260
Please enjoy it.

421
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,815
Good, good. Yes.

422
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,556
Yes, good, good!

423
00:30:55,443 --> 00:31:00,619
<i>Subtitles brought you The Pediatron Team @ Viki </i>

424
00:31:01,713 --> 00:31:04,812
Don't be like this and have just one bite!

425
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:07,165
Here, here.

426
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,815
You can't be like this, you have to eat this to become healthy.

427
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:15,495
She won't eat it. Because it's not somethings she's been eating, she will continue to not eat it.

428
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:18,887
What should we do? Should we tell the professor? Should we give her liquids?

429
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:22,647
She has to eat. She can no longer starve.

430
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:26,544
Doctor Park! Where are you...

431
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,247
Ahjumuni.

432
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:50,544
What is this?! This is really dog food.

433
00:31:50,544 --> 00:31:54,616
She will eat it well. She'll like it most if we give it to her like this.

434
00:31:56,035 --> 00:31:58,415
Please untie her hands.

435
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:02,337
She says to give her food quickly.

436
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:07,028
Ah, really, why are you testing me every time, Doctor Park? <i> ("Why are you tempting me?")</i>

437
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,863
That bastard!

438
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,786
Just let him be.

439
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,738
Director.

440
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:38,169
Do you remember the lecture I gave a long time ago?

441
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,129
"Pediatric patients' treatment and communication"

442
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:41,419
Of course!

443
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:44,950
It's one of the top 3 lectures at Seongwon Medical School.

444
00:32:45,873 --> 00:32:49,631
Do you know form where I got the inspiration for that lecture?

445
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,725
When Si On was young...

446
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:57,078
I thought of it while I was watching Si On's brother and his rabbit.

447
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,014
Really?

448
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:02,567
You're talking about the rabbit that Doctor Park always talks about, right?

449
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,920
That's right.

450
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,603
Although the relationship between the two was of an animal and a human.

451
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,130
They communicated in their own language.

452
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:13,830
The pounding of the heart,

453
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,595
warmth and even small movements...

454
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,504
That was the language just between the two of them.

455
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,718
After having seen that,

456
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:25,660
I thought that I should communicate with the children that way as well.

457
00:33:26,678 --> 00:33:29,474
Of course, children talk, but...

458
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,239
They say expressions that are hard for us to understand.

459
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,666
At those times,

460
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:35,611
you need to listen with your heart.

461
00:33:35,611 --> 00:33:38,601
Like what Si On did with the rabbit.

462
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:40,704
Yes.

463
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:45,428
I want to listen to your lecture again.

464
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:48,314
I have a recorded CD, take it.

465
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:51,371
Stay seated! I'll look for it.

466
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:56,675
It's in the right desk drawer on the very bottom.

467
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,508
My goodness.

468
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:04,584
Could this be Doctor Park?

469
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,114
Yes, it was when he was seven years old.

470
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:10,986
Wow, he was so cute! Look at that bowl shaped hair!

471
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,777
Yes?

472
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:41,775
Gauge.

473
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:50,880
Can't you do it so we have a clear view?

474
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,301
Suction.

475
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:59,020
Tell them to bring in the intraop sono. (<i>* Use of a portable ultrasound device during surgery)</i>

476
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,814
It hasn't been arranged yet.

477
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,683
I told you clearly before the operation.

478
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:06,863
I'm sorry.

479
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:11,393
I told them in advance, but there must've been a mistake in the radiology department.

480
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,731
Dr. Han, push.

481
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:14,370
Yes.

482
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:17,805
Hong Gil Nam.

483
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:20,339
Then just bring the ultrasound machine which is used in the operating room.

484
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:24,942
Hey, you!

485
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,903
Is the operating room your bedroom?

486
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:32,630
If you're going to work like this, quit it and go home!

487
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,217
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:50,385
If you continually feel displeased,

489
00:35:50,385 --> 00:35:53,122
I will discharge Park Si On.

490
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:56,437
Things repeating like this.

491
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:57,833
I don't like it either.

492
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,450
You know the gist of the situation.

493
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,826
From the very beginning, Park Si On wasn't picked based upon his capability.

494
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:05,474
Park Si On.

495
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:09,440
To the board members of the foundation, he's no more than a tool to bring the Director down.

496
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,751
I'm not interested in the foundation's point of view.

497
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:14,864
We are only focused on healing people.

498
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,462
If something happens to Park Si On,

499
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:21,591
everything that the director has built up comes crumbling down.

500
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,632
Then in the end, is the director the only one important?

501
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:30,851
Have you ever had a humane conversation with Park Si On?

502
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:33,839
Si On

503
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,188
...even tries to communicate with animals.

504
00:36:36,188 --> 00:36:38,336
But you, professor...

505
00:36:38,336 --> 00:36:41,420
...you don't try to even communicate with humans.

506
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,177
That kind of communication, you just do it.

507
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,370
I don't feel the need to do it.

508
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,458
Watching how you behave towards Park Si On,

509
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,900
you really look like another person.

510
00:36:56,784 --> 00:36:59,115
Why are you always like this to only Si On?

511
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,847
Always being harsh and cold.

512
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,928
<i>I'm sorry I made you feel bad before.</i>

513
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:20,702
<i>I'll make dinner so after you get off work, come immediately to my house, alright?</i>

514
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,170
<i>You're really sad, right?</i>

515
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:36,462
<i>That you are lonely and sick all alone.</i>

516
00:38:37,544 --> 00:38:39,153
<i>Yes.</i>

517
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:41,636
<i>Just wait a little.</i>

518
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:45,150
<i>I'll make you not hurt.</i>

519
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,949
<i>Thank you.</i>

520
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:49,463
<i>Who do you...</i>

521
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:52,707
<i>...want to see the most right now?</i>

522
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,729
<i>Mom.</i>

523
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,029
<i>Mom</i>

524
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,960
<i>I see.</i>

525
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,927
<i>Alright.</i>

526
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:03,563
<i>Eun Ok,</i>

527
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,823
<i>Go to sleep now.</i>

528
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,574
You're pretty.

529
00:39:20,469 --> 00:39:22,495
I love you.

530
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,400
<i>Do Han Oppa</i>

531
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,300
<i>I have an emergency operation that will probably end tomorrow at dawn.</i>

532
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,915
<i>Eat first.</i>

533
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,300
<i>Professor Kim Do Han</i>

534
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,196
Do I look like a person who won't shed a drop of blood or tear?

535
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:58,113
Looking at your expression, that must be it.

536
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:05,177
No, you're not.

537
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,782
That you're a warm and sympathetic person,

538
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:10,890
I know that better than anyone.

539
00:42:10,923 --> 00:42:16,259
It's just that you're only ruthless to Park Si On.

540
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:20,258
I...

541
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:24,362
I had a younger brother.

542
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,829
And because of my brother,

543
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:32,673
I decided to be a doctor.

544
00:42:32,673 --> 00:42:34,860
Soo Han.

545
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,745
Kim Soo Han.

546
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,083
Intellectual disability, level 3.

547
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:45,594
Luckily, my parents

548
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:48,835
took care of him well since he was young,

549
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:51,641
so his state improved a lot.

550
00:42:52,256 --> 00:42:53,901
With some help from those around him,

551
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:57,159
he was able to lead a normal life.

552
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:02,190
I thought he was cured enough.

553
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:05,650
To the point where he can stand alone.

554
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

555
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:12,297
<i>- Do Han, happy birthday.<br>- Thank you.</i>

556
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:15,487
<i>- Happy birthday. <br>- Cheers!</i>

557
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,400
<i>The Wonders of a Human Body</i>

558
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,427
<i>It's a present for you.</i>

559
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:26,026
<i>You're really going to become a doctor, huh?</i>

560
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:29,231
<i>Wow. Thanks, brother.</i>

561
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:32,804
<i>By reading this, I think I'll become a doctor faster.</i>

562
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:35,106
<i>If you really become a doctor,</i>

563
00:43:35,106 --> 00:43:36,772
<i>you must cure me first.</i>

564
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:38,507
<i>Of course.</i>

565
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,567
<i>You should stop dropping him off at school anymore.</i>

566
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,635
<i>Let Soo Han go by himself.</i>

567
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,409
<i>I know it'll make you uneasy,</i>

568
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:58,131
<i>but you have to help him build a sense of independence.</i>

569
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:02,303
<i>That's how he'll start interacting with people and adapt to how the society works.</i>

570
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:04,457
<i>The fear of the world and the people</i>

571
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,517
<i>can definitely be overcome.</i>

572
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:11,051
<i>So trust me, and let's do that for Soo Han.</i>

573
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:16,327
Because of me.

574
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,790
Because of me, my brother became that way.

575
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,153
If only I hadn't been stubborn.

576
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,400
It's not like that, Professor.

577
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,727
I would have done the same if I were in your position.

578
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:36,208
For my brother.

579
00:45:39,062 --> 00:45:42,269
Not letting him do anything

580
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:45,755
was the best I could have done for Soo Han.

581
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:49,407
My decision that wasn't fully thought out

582
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:52,559
made my brother like that.

583
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:59,887
When I saw Park Si On, he reminded me of my younger brother.

584
00:45:59,887 --> 00:46:03,969
That's why I wanted to return him to his rightful place.

585
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,431
Because that's the best I can do.

586
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,630
Even though your younger brother is no longer here,

587
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:28,359
but you are saving many children.

588
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:33,978
I know that doesn't give you complete consolation.

589
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:39,028
But you comfort many people.

590
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:44,909
Also that's the reason why I have the deepest respect for you.

591
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:01,234
What brings you here at this hour?

592
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:03,778
Let me borrow your bed for one night.

593
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:09,197
It's small and uncomfortable. You should go home to sleep.

594
00:47:48,695 --> 00:47:51,449
She says she's hungry. You should feed her.

595
00:47:51,449 --> 00:47:54,067
She's not barking because she's hungry.

596
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:57,320
It was to wake me up.

597
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,858
I guess it's you who is hungry.

598
00:48:01,858 --> 00:48:04,406
Follow me.

599
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:12,486
Good morning, General Manager.

600
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:15,021
Where's the Professor?

601
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:17,501
He's at NICU for a moment.

602
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,350
I tried to find a time when he doesn't make a round.

603
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,613
But I guess we missed each other.

604
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,166
Aren't you tired?

605
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:29,007
I heard that you guys had an emergency operation until dawn.

606
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,865
We didn't have an operation at dawn.

607
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:34,049
We haven't had a peaceful night like this in a while.

608
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,900
I see.

609
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:43,252
Please!

610
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:47,129
Let's eat the normal rice like a normal person.

611
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:49,820
Instead of forcing it into the shape of onigiri.

612
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,079
It tastes better if it's shaped like this.

613
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:56,148
Fine. You eat however you want.

614
00:48:56,148 --> 00:48:59,648
Shape it into a triangle or a pyramid.

615
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:05,723
Would you like some?

616
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:09,234
No thanks. You eat all you want.

617
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,609
If you're done eating, let's go.

618
00:49:26,638 --> 00:49:33,048
<i>Subtitles brought to you by The Pediatron Team @Viki</i>

619
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:57,142
Ajummoni, what's the matter? Are you sick?

620
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,224
Are you alright?

621
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:15,670
Madam, please come to your senses.

622
00:50:16,731 --> 00:50:17,887
We must move her quickly.

623
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:20,053
We must move her quickly.

624
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:35,908
Oh, you're here?

625
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,099
<br>

626
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,799
I'm sorry about last night.

627
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:45,819
I'm used to your emergencies.

628
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:48,031
You finished it properly?

629
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:50,383
Yeah, it finished properly.

630
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,103
Did you eat?

631
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:56,201
Should we have lunch together?

632
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,451
No, I have an appointment today.

633
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:00,966
Then, let's eat dinner together.

634
00:51:00,987 --> 00:51:03,142
Today, it's for real.

635
00:51:03,154 --> 00:51:06,014
Stop trying to compensate for what you did.

636
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,649
What I don't like more than you treating me indifferently,

637
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,140
is putting a burden on with compensation.

638
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:32,132
It's a relief.

639
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:36,047
I believe the acute stomach cramps symptom came<br>as the enteritis started.

640
00:51:36,047 --> 00:51:37,840
Since there are no other problems,

641
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,467
just stay hospitalized for one or two days to stay safe.

642
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,648
I have a lot of work to do.

643
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:47,632
But you still have to stay, otherwise it'll be too uncomfortable.

644
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:49,966
Oh, right.

645
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:52,886
Doctor Park, say hello.

646
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:55,807
She's the one that made the potato ball soup for you.

647
00:51:58,456 --> 00:52:00,343
Thank you.

648
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:02,309
Did it fit your taste buds?

649
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:06,295
Yes, I ate it very, very well.

650
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:10,447
It tastes just like the one I used to eat in my hometown.

651
00:52:12,434 --> 00:52:14,775
That's a relief.

652
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:18,558
Who made it for you in your hometown?

653
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,994
That...

654
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:26,715
I don't really know.

655
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:34,555
Doctor Park,

656
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,469
you need to hurry and go to Eun Ok.

657
00:52:36,469 --> 00:52:38,375
Ah, yes.

658
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,769
Please take care of yourself.

659
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,534
Thank you.

660
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:56,463
We need to admit you into our hospital,

661
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:59,140
do you have any family that can come here?

662
00:53:01,132 --> 00:53:03,103
Oh, I...

663
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:05,890
I'm alone.

664
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,932
Oh, is that so?

665
00:53:09,336 --> 00:53:12,310
There needs to be an admission though.

666
00:53:12,743 --> 00:53:14,518
Alright.

667
00:53:14,547 --> 00:53:16,038
Just lay down and rest.

668
00:53:16,038 --> 00:53:18,078
I'll complete the admission for you.

669
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:20,430
You can just give me your ID.

670
00:53:44,143 --> 00:53:45,533
Do you want to come in?

671
00:53:45,533 --> 00:53:46,440
Yes!

672
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,165
Aren't you scared?

673
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:51,014
We are scared,

674
00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:54,314
but we want to try being next to her.

675
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:56,822
Come in.

676
00:53:58,437 --> 00:54:00,076
You have to come in slowly.

677
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:02,037
Slowly.

678
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,792
Am I allowed to touch her?

679
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,044
Yeah.

680
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:25,045
Slowly.

681
00:54:33,597 --> 00:54:35,926
She likes children more.

682
00:54:35,926 --> 00:54:39,695
She likes them more because they are nice and friendly.

683
00:54:49,992 --> 00:54:52,236
She seems like an unni to me,

684
00:54:52,236 --> 00:54:54,533
but she's really cute.

685
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:50,607
Um, this.

686
00:55:54,457 --> 00:55:56,456
<br>

687
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:25,355
You're leaving the country already?

688
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:27,815
Well, I have some business to attend to.

689
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:29,922
Ah, I see.

690
00:56:29,922 --> 00:56:33,198
The gift you gave me yesterday will become useful.

691
00:56:33,198 --> 00:56:36,257
It may be difficult for the pediatric surgery department right now,

692
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:40,980
but as it'll put macroeconomic pressure on<br>the foundation, it'll become helpful.

693
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,297
Yes, I understand.

694
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:45,090
But,

695
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:49,681
I didn't think you had any ties with Gomyeong Group and SQ Group chairmen, so

696
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,962
<i>I'm curious as to how you persuaded them.</i>

697
00:56:52,962 --> 00:56:56,098
You'll find out when the time comes. Let's hang up.

698
00:56:58,773 --> 00:57:01,368
Ah, I'm sorry. I had an urgent call.

699
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:04,362
What were talking about?

700
00:57:04,577 --> 00:57:07,365
Oh, there's someone who is bothering you?

701
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:09,186
It's the person executive managing director Yi brought on board.

702
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:11,582
Our hospital's Assistant Director, Kang Hyeon Tae.

703
00:57:11,582 --> 00:57:13,851
Kang Hyeon Tae.

704
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:18,201
It's my first time hearing about him.

705
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,776
Is he someone that can cause problems?

706
00:57:20,776 --> 00:57:23,933
He's quite a departure from the people <br>on executive managing director Yi's side.

707
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:26,254
He has a quick grasp on situations,

708
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:29,829
and over everything else, I think he has something else planned.

709
00:57:31,132 --> 00:57:33,726
I'll find out about it separately.

710
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:36,569
If he's to become an obstacle, we should make provisions.

711
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:44,151
Thank you for taking care of Woomyeong Group and SQ Group. You've worked hard.

712
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:46,577
No, it was nothing.

713
00:57:46,577 --> 00:57:50,980
Chairman from both groups were best of friends with my father.

714
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:55,779
I almost became that households' daughter-in-law, too.

715
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:58,720
That's why they believed my words easily,

716
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,889
all the problems regarding our foundation.

717
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:05,403
You're going up against your mother,

718
00:58:05,419 --> 00:58:07,038
will it be okay?

719
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:08,759
She's not my mother,

720
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:11,316
She's Chairman Lee Yeo Won.

721
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:18,243
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

722
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:20,940
Unni, unni, stretch your hands,

723
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,859
and tickle, tickle, tickle!

724
00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:26,416
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

725
00:58:29,698 --> 00:58:30,976
Yes?

726
00:58:30,976 --> 00:58:34,103
Go to the ER right now and suture abdominal laceration patient.

727
00:58:34,103 --> 00:58:36,464
Ah, I understand.

728
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,505
<i>First, just make a commotion.</i>

729
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:15,204
<i>I'll do the rest.</i>

730
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:46,009
Everything is done.

731
00:59:48,278 --> 00:59:50,433
Thank you for enduring this,

732
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,741
now it will be alright.

733
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:18,644
Why is this open? AH!

734
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,507
<i>Mommy!</i>

735
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:32,690
Are you okay?

736
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,165
Hey, calm down.

737
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:36,777
Hey, hey, hey!

738
01:00:36,777 --> 01:00:38,263
Hey!

739
01:00:57,707 --> 01:01:00,458
This is a follow up ultrasound picture on Eun Ok from 2 hours ago.

740
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,844
The size of the abscess got larger.

741
01:01:02,844 --> 01:01:05,692
It seems like the antibiotics didn't do any good.

742
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:08,100
Then should we use different antibiotics?

743
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,538
No,

744
01:01:09,538 --> 01:01:12,857
Seeing as the abscess enlarged, we can't just watch anymore.

745
01:01:12,899 --> 01:01:14,802
If we do it wrong, it could burst.

746
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:17,714
Cha Yoon Seo,

747
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:19,280
Of course.

748
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,867
Yes?

749
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:23,241
Yes?!

750
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:29,954
Just a second! Wait!

751
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:34,497
What happened?

752
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:37,623
I think the door was open when Dr. Park was not there.

753
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,223
Please just stand still, we will do it.

754
01:01:43,223 --> 01:01:45,455
We'll guide her away safely.

755
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:47,601
This child has abdominal condition.

756
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:48,859
You can't just handle her recklessly.

757
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:51,286
We will take care of this, so you doctors just stay still, please.

758
01:01:51,286 --> 01:01:53,458
I said you can't!

759
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:56,118
Just leave them be for now.

760
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:37,240
Please don't do that! Please don't do that!

761
01:02:37,775 --> 01:02:39,788
-Doctor Park!<br>-What are you doing right now?!

762
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:43,818
Doctor Park! Why are you acting like this?

763
01:03:17,186 --> 01:03:19,895
<i> Preview</i>

764
01:03:19,895 --> 01:03:22,078
<i>It's not like you're begging in front of your homeroom teacher.<br>What are you doing here?</i>

765
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:24,943
<i>I can find many other moon face than Kang Han Sook.</i>

766
01:03:24,943 --> 01:03:27,065
We come here to get the kid treated but he just ends up getting hurt.

767
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:28,326
we will just transfer to a different hospital.

768
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:30,946
Why can't you just let it go once?! Just once!

769
01:03:30,946 --> 01:03:32,747
You've worked hard all this time, Do Han.

770
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:36,371
-Park Si On sunbae...<br>-Why won't he pick up his phone?!

771
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:37,734
I didn't even think about that.

772
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:39,829
<i>Even to Dr. Cha who believed in you...</i>

773
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:43,230
Doctor Park Si On, we'll send him off tomorrow.
