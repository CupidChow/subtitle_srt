00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,730
Who are you?

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,770
What did you do to me?

4
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,400
You did something to me, right?

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,590
<i>The rapists are using more
daring methods.</i>

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,870
<i>The police arrested a man who pretended
to be a boyfriend to three drunken women</i>

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,080
<i>and took them home to rape them.</i>

8
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm going to call the police.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,690
Don't come any closer.

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,880
This is my house.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,860
It's not your house.
It's my house.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,530
This bastard.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,090
Just wait...

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,620
My cellphone...

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,680
I told you not to come near me.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,970
Don't come near me!

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,320
Don't come near me.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,400
What unit is this?

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,600
This is unit 101.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,010
101...

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,700
Turn your head.

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,500
No, not that way.

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,800
Turn the other way.

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,440
How embarrassing.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,380
Don't look.

26
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,850
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,890
I was mistaken.

28
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,740
I used to live there
until last week.

29
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,340
Now I live in Unit 201.

30
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,000
But, I think you still have
the same code as before.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,350
I was drunk, went to my old house,
and used that code.

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,720
You understand the situation, right?

33
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,170
No.

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,790
I'm really sorry.

35
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,230
You're new, right?

36
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,270
Which department?

37
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,330
I'm Park Shi On, and I'm a
resident in the pediatrics ward.

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,300
Oh, the new resident.

39
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,650
I didn't see you yesterday
because I left early.

40
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,900
I'm in the second year of my fellowship there.
My name is Cha Yoon Seo.

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,570
I'm your senior,
so I can talk comfortably, right?

42
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,690
Make a right turn
in front of the convenience store.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,880
What?

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,700
Pass the laundromat,
and go straight.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,060
Are you ignoring me?

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,280
At the bus stop 80 meters ahead,
take bus number 202.

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,650
You're being this rude to me
because I made a mistake?

48
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,170
Then what? Talk.

49
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,860
It will take 16 minutes to get
to the hospital.

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,080
There are eight stops in total.

51
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,770
Is he that persistent,
or is he stupid?

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,700
I knew it...

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,250
He looks normal, but seeing how he talks,
he doesn't seem normal.

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,640
Professor didn't say anything?

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,870
No.

56
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,820
But, don't you have to be at least in your
fellowship year to reside at the dormitory?

57
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,890
Yeah, but he's got
the director's support.

58
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,120
That's what I don't get.

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
The director doesn't fool around
with hiring.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,320
Hey.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,980
Hey.

62
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,720
Why are you giving me
aftershave lotion?

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,790
You still smell like liquor.

64
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,130
Put it on your face
before we make our round.

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,540
I don't need this.
I can put on perfume.

66
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,430
You don't have any.

67
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't laugh.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,930
How does he know that I don't
have any perfume?

69
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,240
I saw that in the neighborhood
bathhouse.

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,590
It makes you smell like an old man.

71
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,510
So, you want me to teach you a way
for other kids not to bother you at school?

72
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,050
Yes, I want everyone to be
scared of me.

73
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,720
Okay.
Who's the thug in your class?

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,610
What do you mean?

75
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,950
I don't get it.

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,670
I mean who is the best
at fighting?

77
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,740
Bae Tae Gwang.
Tyrannosaurus Bae Tae Gwang.

78
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,440
Tyranno?
Is that his nickname?

79
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,090
As soon as you go to the school,
go in front of him and say this.

80
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,330
'Hey, come over here!'

81
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,100
If you do that, he'll say this...

82
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,780
'Is that kid crazy?'

83
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,520
Then say, 'Yeah, I'm crazy.
You want me to bust your face?'

84
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,110
If you do that, he'll go outside.

85
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,910
As soon as he does,
grab some sand, and throw it at his eyes.

86
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,670
What are you doing?

87
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,170
Stop teaching them bad things,
and check the orders.

88
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,620
Okay.

89
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,690
I'll tell you the second part next time.

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,850
He can't even stand up to the
head nurse.

91
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,400
He's a liar.

92
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Are you serious?

93
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,070
How can a man like that
be a pediatrician?

94
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,590
He's got the director's support.

95
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,020
He won't be able to withstand
Kim Do Han.

96
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,870
Even the competent residents were
unable to stick around.

97
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,110
I know.

98
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,780
But, I wonder how bad his
condition is...

99
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,420
He's coming.

100
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,160
This is the new resident,
Dr. Park Shi On.

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,340
Hello, I'm from 23-12 Gu Am Dong,
Chun Cheon City...

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,560
Hey, that's enough.
You're embarrassing us.

103
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,990
Nice to meet you,
I'm Nam Joo Yeon.

104
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,760
Good to meet you,
I'm Jo Jung Min.

105
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,400
Please prepare for Eun Ji's surgery.

106
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:32,030
Professor, this is just my opinion,
but Eun Ji...

107
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,290
I think it would be good for her to get
some psychological treatment.

108
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,800
I will take your opinion
as an opinion.

109
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,150
The results of the surgery are good.

110
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,800
The progress of cirrhosis of the liver
is minimal

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,880
and since his stool color is green,
the jaundice will go away in a few days.

112
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,290
- You won't need to worry.
- Thank you, sir.

113
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,410
Feed him milk increasing by 20 cc every
three hours. Check his urine, too.

114
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,830
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,830
You're not writing it down?

116
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,500
I am. In here.

117
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,760
Then tell us the orders for each
patient we visited.

118
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,630
Choi Min Ho from Room 1101,
change the antibiotic to PO.

119
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,380
Administer the second generation
cepha antibiotics.

120
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,140
Seo Ah Eun from Room 1103,
Upper GI Series NST consultation.

121
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,930
Yoo Hyung Seo from Room 1105,
Abdomen sonography. NPO for two days.

122
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,010
Park Shi On. The orders aren't made
to train your brains.

123
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,580
You need to take notes
for the patient...

124
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,540
Stop.
Let him be.

125
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,370
Yoo Sung Ho.

126
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,730
Did Sung Ho draw those?

127
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,570
Yes, he wants to become
an entomologist.

128
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,060
He loves butterflies.

129
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,750
He drew them so well.

130
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,030
I love butterflies, too.

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,120
Here, Sung Ho.

132
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,770
Are you okay?

133
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,410
What do I do?

134
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,340
What is patient Yoo Sung Ho's diagnosis
from Room 1108?

135
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Oh, Sung Ho?

136
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,690
He had an operation for a biliary cyst
three days ago.

137
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,520
Can I see the records?

138
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,000
Sure.

139
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,190
Since when has he been
this lethargic?

140
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,060
He's been like this since yesterday morning,
saying that his stomach hurts.

141
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,610
When did he start vomiting?

142
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,630
Since early this morning.

143
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,250
Is he urinating well?

144
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,280
No, not since yesterday.

145
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,190
Sung Ho!

146
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,870
Sung Ho!
Say something!

147
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,010
Sung Ho!
Say something!

148
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,960
Sung Ho needs another operation.
It's urgent.

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,490
Explain clearly.

150
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,680
- Is he Manager Ko's patient?
- Yes.

151
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,790
He had a surgery for biliary cyst.

152
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,980
Park Shi On, come outside.

153
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,780
Please wait a bit.

154
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,040
Sung Ho...

155
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,090
He will be okay.
Please calm down.

156
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,520
That's what the doctor said yesterday.
That he's fine!

157
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,060
And now what?

158
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,940
Sung Ho is in danger.
He's in danger.

159
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,470
- Sung Ho is in danger.
- What danger is he in?

160
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,760
It's been three days since the surgery, but he
still has a fever and he's got a bad stomachache.

161
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,310
- He's vomiting up bile.
- That could be due to ileus.

162
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,850
No, there's more.

163
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,450
Sung Ho is suffering from dehydration, and
he hasn't been able to urinate since yesterday.

164
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,810
And he has rebound tenderness
in his abdomen.

165
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,120
It's after surgery, so it's
natural that he doesn't have the energy.

166
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,970
Perhaps, his intestinal mobility isn't fully
recovered. It's also possible to have aches.

167
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,250
No.

168
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,230
If the surgery went well,
he would have more energy.

169
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,430
Children are strong. If the doctor
does a good job, they recover quickly.

170
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,990
Who were the assistants?

171
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,390
They were fourth year HPB specialists.

172
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,200
Call the manager now.

173
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,820
He went to a seminar.

174
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
Then, you call him yourself.

175
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,590
And you.

176
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,400
Don't do or say anything
from now on.

177
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,170
What a great way to
introduce yourself.

178
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,730
Follow me.

179
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,540
Why isn't he picking up?

180
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,990
Good shot!

181
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,360
That's nice.

182
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,620
Should I tell the HPB specialists
about the manager's patient?

183
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,600
Just focus on the current patient.

184
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,750
Still, shouldn't we let
Professor Kim Jae Joon...

185
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,940
You're not going to focus?

186
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,730
Since the last CT, the hepatic portal vein
has expanded.

187
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,790
If we had spent another day getting her
psychological treatment as Dr. Cha recommended

188
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,180
what do you think would
have happened?

189
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,050
Park Shi On.

191
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,960
Where is he?

192
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,260
Park Shi On.
He was here before.

193
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,270
He must have left in the middle.

194
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,780
I think he went back to
that patient.

195
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,150
Seriously, this kid...

196
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,390
What's wrong with him?
What is he thinking?

197
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,140
Everybody, pay attention,
and focus on Eun Ji!

198
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,560
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,410
I don't know what to do about
Chae Kyung.

200
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:41,520
I thought time would heal,
but it seems to get worse.

201
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,460
She's always been very fond
of her biological mother.

202
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,370
It must be hard on you,
but give it more time.

203
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,010
She's a smart kid, so she'll come to a
realization soon.

204
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,330
That would be good, but...

205
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,100
I guess it may just be my greed.

206
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,990
Excuse me.

207
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,930
Yes, Dr. Park.

208
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,240
What?

209
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,890
Slowly, say it again more slowly.

210
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,050
You're in a class of your own.

211
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,240
Why don't you try out as a pro?

212
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,520
You're just making me feel good.

213
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,150
By the way, our company product
has been approved, right?

214
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,290
What do you mean?
I'm taking care of that for you.

215
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,310
Thank you.

216
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,990
At the next hole,
it will help you to visualize the hole...

217
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,110
Your phone's been ringing since before.

218
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,270
How annoying...

219
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,220
Hello?

220
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,560
Its about Sung Ho.
If you don't come now, he'll be in danger.

221
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,640
I'll be there in two hours.
Keep an eye on him.

222
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,830
It'll be too late.

223
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,140
Should I call Dr. Kim Do Han
or someone else?

224
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,720
What are you talking about?

225
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,060
He's my patient.

226
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,400
I understand.

227
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,300
Don't let anyone else touch him.
I'll take care of it.

228
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,850
The manager will be here
in two hours.

229
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,300
No, that will be too late.

230
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,820
- Can we transfer to a different department?
- He said no way.

231
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,380
Please hurry and do something.
Please...

232
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,940
Please save my Sung Ho.

233
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,010
Please help him.

234
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,240
You don't have any orders, yet.

235
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,190
Why aren't you stopping him?

236
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,960
What do I do?

237
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,190
Nurse Jo!

238
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,160
I don't care anymore.

239
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry!

240
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,660
Nurse Jo!

241
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,720
Hold on.

242
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,530
Get out of the way!

243
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,220
Nurse Jo, wait!

244
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,030
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,750
Hey, Jo Jung Min!

246
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,080
I'm sorry.

247
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,560
What's going on?

248
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,970
Vice President.
You see...

249
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,960
We got a call from Nurse Nam.
You can't come in without permission.

250
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,300
I'm sorry, but I'll be sorry
one more time.

251
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,510
This is a nightmare.
Damn it!

252
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
I understand.

253
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,560
Dr. Park Shi On transferred the patient
to the operation room without permission.

254
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,200
It's next door.

255
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,330
What about the manager?
He'll be here in two hours.

256
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,820
He asked that no one else
touch the patient.

257
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,240
Two hours would be too late.

258
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,140
Mixter forceps.

259
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,230
It's not too late.

260
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,870
Return the patient.

261
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,250
Heart rate 160.
BP 80/40.

262
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,340
Body temperature 39...
No, 38.9 degrees.

263
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,890
Doesn't seem good.

264
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,860
What do we do?

265
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,370
His pulse is dropping.

266
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,960
I'm going crazy!

267
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,920
I think I'm going to die.

268
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,320
I have to operate on him now.
Otherwise, Sung Ho will die.

269
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,420
I'll do it.

270
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,370
You can't do this, Dr. Park!

271
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,480
Calm down.

272
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,880
Professor!

273
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,650
Do you know what you just did?

274
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,780
It's septic shock.

275
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,060
- I suspect it may be peritonitis...
- Shut up!

276
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,230
Nurse Jo.

277
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,270
- I'll perform the surgery.
- What?

278
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,770
Listen carefully, we will work on
two patients simultaneously.

279
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,730
Dr. Cha and Woo Il Kyu, stay with Eun Ji.

280
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,520
Dr. Han, Hong Gil Nam, and Kim Sun Joo...

281
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,320
change your gown and gloves,
and come by Sung Ho.

282
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,700
Hong Gil Nam, prepare the operating table.
Kim Sun Joo, get an available anesthesiologist.

283
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,980
Dr. Han, prepare for a laparotomy.

284
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,180
I'll help, too.

285
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,610
- I have experience in an operating room.
- Nurse Jo.

286
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,210
Then, please help me out for today,
Head Nurse.

287
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,720
Every time I switch from one room to another,
please get new gloves and a gown for me quickly.

288
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,180
Yes, sir.

289
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,250
- Let's start.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,510
I'll participate, too.
I'll participate.

291
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,230
Get out, Park Shi On.

292
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,810
- Get out of the operating room.
- No, I want to stay...

293
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,170
Get out!

294
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,850
What brings you here?

295
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,170
Professor Kim Do Han,
he's really something else.

296
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,810
How can he perform a surgery like this...

297
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,140
Cut.

298
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,650
I'll go over to Sung Ho.

299
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,860
Dr. Cha, begin the ablation procedure
starting with the lateral hepatic portal vein.

300
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,840
- Be careful around the heart vessels.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,740
The CT shows
mesentery obstruction.

302
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,820
Something was not done right.

303
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,620
Amylase and lipase levels were normal
before the surgery, but now...

304
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,230
Shut up, and stay put!

305
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,440
Scalpel.

306
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,120
Gauze.

307
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,570
Ascites suction.

308
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,730
The intestines...

309
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,110
The mesenteries were ill-treated,
so the small intestines went inside.

310
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,960
It could be the mistake of
an inexperienced surgeon.

311
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,910
Furthermore, there's ischemic change due to
constriction 20 cm below the enteroanastomosis.

312
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,700
Then, is there a problem with
the enteroanastomosis...

313
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,370
We've discovered the source of the problem,
so we should see if we can recover the intestine.

314
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,360
We've taken care of the
intestines stuck inside.

315
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,220
Warm saline solution.

316
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,410
If we didn't have the surgery early,
it would have been a disaster.

317
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,850
Bowel color is returning.

318
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,180
Keep putting in warm saline solution,
and see if the small intestines react.

319
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,360
Yes, sir.

320
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,670
Even as I watch,
I can't believe it.

321
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,450
Blood.
Blood.

322
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,250
Hurry.
Hurry.

323
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,840
There's blood accumulating around
the pancreas.

324
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,610
Professor Kim, what's going on?

325
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,850
There's a hemorrhage around the pancreas,
but the source is not clear.

326
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,930
Is it a problem with the
biliary cyst treatment area?

327
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:54,190
It doesn't seem that way.

328
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:04,650
The ablation procedure around the
lateral hepatic portal vein is finished.

329
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,610
But, I can't ablate the central region.

330
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,340
Leave that part,
and work on the lower part.

331
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
Understood.

332
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,630
Fortunately,
we've saved the small intestines.

333
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,100
There doesn't seem to be a problem
with the pancreas.

334
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,640
If we ended the surgery without knowing,
it would have been a problem.

335
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,040
But the cause is unknown.

336
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,660
Order!
Order!

337
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,490
Order!

338
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,740
- What was this patient's injection order?
- Third generation Cepha and Heta Vizen.

339
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,000
What did you just say?

340
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,440
Heta Vizen.

341
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,300
It's a somatostatin manufactured by
an American company, Saint Medic.

342
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,860
There were reports of cholestasis, acute pancreatitis,
and hemorrhaging when injected to children.

343
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,570
Currently, the U.S. bans its use
on children.

344
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,520
However, in Korea, it's been used in
clinical settings since last March.

345
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,670
The national drug administrators gave warnings
for it to be used with precaution.

346
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,950
This is the report from the April issue
of Children's Medicine Weekly, page 16.

347
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,830
Cauterizer.

348
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm done with as much of the
ablation procedure as I can administer.

349
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,320
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

350
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,400
I'll be going over to Eun Ji. Spray glue on
the hemorrhage site, and finish up.

351
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,340
It won't be problematic.
He didn't bleed much.

352
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,840
Both surgeries were successful.
Good job.

353
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:05,190
It's just as I heard.
I'm truly touched.

354
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,830
You should hurry and relay the results
to the guardians.

355
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,060
What brings the two of you here?

356
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,530
Take care.

357
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,470
Professor Kim,
who gave you permission?

358
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,650
Professor!

359
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,600
- Professor.
- Let go.

360
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,470
- Let go!
- Professor.

361
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,390
Laughing?

362
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,810
You think I'm playing?

363
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,790
Please calm down.

364
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,730
Tell him you're sorry.

365
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,280
He doesn't even know what
he did wrong.

366
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,260
You think everything is okay
because the patients are fine?

367
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,480
No way.

368
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,300
Luckily, both kids are fine.

369
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,030
But if we were unlucky, we may
have lost both kids because of you!

370
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:23,230
What's worse than an indifferent doctor
is a doctor who doesn't know his place.

371
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,200
If someone acts rashly like you...

372
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,860
the patient will die...

373
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,160
and so will the doctor.

374
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,790
I'll talk to him, so he understands.

375
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,920
There's no need.

376
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,780
Don't ever let me see him again.

377
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,390
Dr. Park, follow me.

378
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,670
Professor.

379
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,110
What do you think you are doing,
Professor Kim?

380
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,420
You can't tell?

381
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,410
You're so disrespectful.

382
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,940
How dare you...

383
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,460
It must have been a golf seminar?

384
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,950
You still don't know
what you did wrong?

385
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,180
Butterfly.

386
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,950
Butterfly.

387
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,100
Pretty butterfly.

388
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,030
What are you saying?

389
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,200
You really don't know?

390
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,990
Listen carefully.

391
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,980
The main operating doctor
knows his patient the best.

392
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,580
If another doctor performs surgery
out of urgency, it may be very dangerous.

393
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,680
Because he may not know enough
about the patient.

394
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,840
And he may make an even
bigger mistake.

395
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:31,030
That's why the professor asked you
to wait for Manager Ko.

396
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,350
Okay?

397
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
And one more thing.

398
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,010
To us, concentration is everything.
You ruined that.

399
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,090
Our whole team was out of focus today.

400
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,550
Now, do you know what
you did wrong?

401
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,430
At least, pretend you do.

402
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,430
Okay, I'll be right there.

403
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,770
Stay here, and wait for me
to go to the dormitory.

404
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,640
Don't go alone.

405
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,820
No, show me your fist.

406
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,480
For a moment, I lost my cool.

407
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,830
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

409
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,510
He did something for you to
get angry at.

410
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm sorry for bringing a
burden upon you.

411
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,740
Don't say that to me.

412
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,240
We should deal with Heta Vizen
before Park Shi On.

413
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,430
Yes, we should definitely
take care of that.

414
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:31,720
And Professor Kim, there's something
you should know about Dr. Park Shi On.

415
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,060
<i>I'm telling you this,
so you don't misunderstand him.</i>

416
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:44,220
<i>The reason Shi On laughed when you hit him
was because he still has symptoms of autism.</i>

417
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,800
<i>Emotional fear is expressed
in the opposite way for him.</i>

418
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,690
<i>When Shi On was young, he used to
get beat up more because of that.</i>

419
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,770
<i>Because he kept on laughing
even while he was getting beaten up.</i>

420
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,040
Thank you, Sung Ho.

421
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,730
Doctor.

422
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,520
Thank you.

423
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,110
Sung Ho was reborn
thanks to you.

424
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,300
I'll tell Sung Ho to live well.

425
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,350
And I'll tell him to become a
great person like you.

426
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,560
Thank you. Thank you.

427
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,990
Thank you.

428
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,510
I told you not to go anywhere.

429
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,480
You don't listen at all.

430
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,370
You didn't eat lunch, right?

431
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,630
Here, eat it.

432
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,240
Eat it.

433
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,950
I won't eat it.

434
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,790
Why not?

435
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,920
I just don't want to eat it.

436
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,860
Even if you are upset,
you should eat.

437
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,040
We work, so we can eat.

438
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,310
I don't want to.

439
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,320
Just eat it.

440
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,120
Open up.
Eat it.

441
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,220
Come on.

442
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,580
Here.

443
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,440
Eat it.

444
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,930
Here.

445
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,390
Here.

446
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,460
Come on.

447
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,550
Professor Kim.

448
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,720
I heard you are having a hard time
because of that kid.

449
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,260
That's why I was against it.

450
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,500
You should have just stayed under me.

451
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,520
You're having so many problems
in the pediatrics ward.

452
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,250
It's no trouble.

453
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,980
And there are problems
in every department.

454
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,570
But your department has
a lot of problems.

455
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,670
That girl Cha Yoon Seo, too.

456
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,820
Cha Yoon Seo?

457
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,920
There's a child who suffers from
hepatoblastoma in our department.

458
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,460
<i>She caused a scene telling my people
that she was going to transfer her over.</i>

459
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,210
<i>She must be looking down on her classmates
because she was the top of class.</i>

460
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,940
I'm sure Manager Ko is
busy with his own work.

461
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,920
It wasn't your order, was it?

462
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,910
No.

463
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,490
I will take care of that.

464
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,920
Of course.

465
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,140
It's not like all children should
be sent there.

466
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,400
You won't even be able to handle it.

467
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,120
Follow the rules.

468
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,060
Stop being arrogant.

469
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,120
One more thing.

470
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,580
You should take care of your manager.

471
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,680
He was my classmate.

472
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,050
You've got no respect.

473
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,360
When a floor nurse leaves
to tend the operating room

474
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,010
don't you realize that you're leaving
your assigned area?

475
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,300
That's against the rules.

476
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,630
And disobeying my orders...

477
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,900
It's not like I sold over
the hospital...

478
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,660
Are you saying you did well?

479
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,380
I'm not saying I did well...

480
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,870
But Sung Ho was saved.

481
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:27,720
While you were gone, what would've happened
if there were another emergency?

482
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,810
I'm sorry.

483
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:33,800
I want you to submit a letter of apology,
and there will be a paycut.

484
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,560
I can write 100 letters of apology,
but about the paycut...

485
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,320
The monthly rent is so high.

486
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,220
And you know I consume
a lot of food.

487
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,110
Who told you to cause this mess?

488
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,450
What are you doing?

489
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,140
What are you doing?

490
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,530
Here, throw it in her eyes.

491
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:58,770
That's how you can win.

492
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,330
You can't do this.

493
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,630
How insane...

494
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,400
I've made some changes to our plan.

495
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,380
It won't work using standard methods.

496
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,930
I'll explain in detail, later.

497
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:24,400
I may be on the same boat as you.

498
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,980
Yes?

499
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,320
Was Chairman very upset yesterday?

500
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,220
You know well that she's very sensitive
about staff restructuring.

501
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,380
If I had more abilities, I would have come up
with a better proposal. I'm sorry.

502
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,970
Your abilities are more than enough
for our hospital.

503
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,440
Thank you for the compliment.

504
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,970
That is a mystery though.

505
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:01,280
That the best professional like you
came here just to save a hospital.

506
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,870
Just a hospital?

507
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,670
It's the nation's best,
Sung Won University Hospital.

508
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,740
It's just as big as any corporation.

509
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,710
You're very wise.

510
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,170
I hope you will teach me well
in the future.

511
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,920
You're over complimenting me.

512
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,530
Although I overlook the management office,
I'm just an observer.

513
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,450
You're the one who will lead
the hospital in the future.

514
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,010
I'm so tired.

515
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,320
Why aren't you coming in?

516
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,970
Dr. Park.

517
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,410
Dr. Cha, the professor said
he doesn't want to see him.

518
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,730
Shut up.
I'll take care of it.

519
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,750
This tension in the air.

520
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,690
Cha Yoon Seo, come to my room.

521
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,680
Why did you go to the
Hepatopancreatobiliary department?

522
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,650
How did you know?

523
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,020
It's none other than Manager Kim Jae Joon.
He's the top in that field.

524
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,420
Why did you request a transfer
when nothing happened to the patient?

525
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,210
It was because
they don't know anything.

526
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,430
Be quiet!

527
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,250
Don't touch Manager Kim
in the future.

528
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,610
Do you understand?

529
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,470
Yes.

530
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,330
In Hae.

531
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:58,210
The best looking girl in the pediatrics ward,
Na In Hae, is back.

532
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,000
I thought you were well
because I didn't see you here.

533
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,900
I know. I wanted
to go to school for a change.

534
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,640
But I collapsed again.

535
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,840
Oh, no.
Were you in the emergency room?

536
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,020
Yes.

537
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,040
I think I'm fine, but
they want me hospitalized again.

538
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,150
I'm so sick of it.

539
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,520
Dr. Cha Yoon Seo asked me to
give this to you.

540
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,820
Thank you.

541
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
Good bye.

542
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,980
What is this beautiful scent
spreading around the hospital?

543
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,730
Park Shi On.

544
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,150
Yes.

545
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,340
You can go home at six
starting today.

546
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,670
Professor, what do you mean?

547
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,600
Why would a resident go home?

548
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,250
I will stay at the hospital.

549
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,160
I'll study, and take care
of the patients.

550
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,590
Mind your business,
and get ready to go home.

551
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,660
Don't make me say it three times.

552
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,560
Professor.

553
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,300
What is it?

554
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,390
I can understand why you
scolded Park Shi On this morning.

555
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,080
But, making him go home early...

556
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,930
He's still got abilities.

557
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,150
That's the problem.

558
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,100
Park Shi On has great medical knowledge
and diagnosis skills.

559
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,470
He's a few steps ahead of you.

560
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,930
No, even more.

561
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,300
But, Park Shi On only thinks about
curing patients.

562
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,420
There's nothing wrong with that.

563
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,900
No, there is.

564
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,010
That's not based on logical decisions
or assurance.

565
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:45,500
It's just a robotic response
from training.

566
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,600
The Park Shi On that I observed
for two days is a robot.

567
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,350
He's a programmed robot
that just focuses on curing the patient.

568
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:59,080
I don't think that's a fair analogy.

569
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,900
Park Shi On has emotions, too.

570
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,140
I'm sure he does.

571
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,760
But, I'm talking about a
doctor's mentality.

572
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,040
Park Shi On doesn't have the
mentality of a doctor.

573
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,800
Savant syndrome?

574
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,150
Ingenious abilities?

575
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,490
Those are dysfunctional signs of the brain.

576
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,090
And another symptom of autism.

577
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,720
He may have seemed like a robot
because he can't communicate well.

578
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,350
That's not the problem.
It's his mentality as a doctor.

579
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,880
You saw, too.

580
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,890
He showed symptoms of autism
during a time of urgency.

581
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,700
<i>Repetitive behavior and
high-tone speech.</i>

582
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,070
<i>It's the exact signs of autism.</i>

583
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,930
If he continues that in times of urgency,
he's bound to make a mistake.

584
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,550
That's true, but it's because
he's not totally cured, yet.

585
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,180
He can get better.
If you take care of him until then...

586
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,460
Cha Yoon Seo.

587
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,200
You should be focusing on the patients,
not Park Shi On.

588
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,720
If you neglect your duties because
of this nonsense...

589
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,630
you'll be out, too.

590
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,060
Remember that.

591
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,270
Hello.

592
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,100
Mister, stop!

593
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,660
Thank you.

594
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,390
I almost threw up blood
chasing after you.

595
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,610
I suspect it may be damage to your
esophagus or the gastric varix.

596
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,340
No, I just mean that
it was really hard.

597
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,220
Oh, I see.

598
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,460
Just go home at a regular time
for a few days.

599
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,040
Then, things will go back
to normal.

600
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,270
Are you upset?

601
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,400
No.

602
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,330
Your stomach growls louder than
the bus engine.

603
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,220
Are you eating well?

604
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,190
I buy Jeonjoo triangular rolls and American
salad sandwich at the convenience store.

605
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,710
It's very delicious.

606
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,790
How can you eat that everyday?

607
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,170
I don't get sick of them.

608
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,680
Let's get off.

609
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,600
I need to go eight more stops.

610
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,980
Just get off.

611
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,140
It's not like I'll cook for you everyday.

612
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,700
Tell me everything you want to eat.

613
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,480
Beef stew.

614
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,220
That's too hard.
Something else.

615
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,990
Stir-fried beef.

616
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,190
That's too sweet.
Something else.

617
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,920
Steamed chicken.

618
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,820
That's a lot of work.
Something else.

619
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,520
I'll just eat the triangular rolls.

620
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,350
Are you turning down my generosity?

621
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,810
Then...

622
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,730
Let's eat egg rolls, dried laver,
and kimchi.

623
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:15,440
How does that sound?

624
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,690
Okay.

625
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,340
You should be assisting us in
kicking out that director.

626
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,940
Instead, you make a fool of yourself?

627
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,760
Why did you use that kind of medicine?

628
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,560
Today was a really good chance.

629
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,830
I'm sorry.

630
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,490
President Kim, that bastard!
How could he give us that medicine...

631
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,980
Anyway...

632
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:52,730
As you know,
he's my only brother in law.

633
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,410
I just moved him to Seoul.
I can't send him back down to Wool San.

634
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,500
Yes, I'll look for a way.

635
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,570
Thank you.

636
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,170
Thank you.

637
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:09,840
But...

638
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,110
I don't know if the director
will just sit back.

639
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,270
Thinking about it again,
I think you are pretty sneaky.

640
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,260
Going back to yesterday.

641
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,740
I went in your house by mistake.

642
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,240
Isn't it normal to wake me up,
and send me home?

643
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,890
Did you wake me up?

644
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,290
Look at this kid...

645
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,040
Why didn't you wake me up?

646
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,720
You were sleeping so heavily.

647
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,370
Yeah, right.

648
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,690
You didn't wake me up, so you could
continue to see me undressed, right?

649
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,970
You see?

650
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,320
This sneaky kid.

651
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,970
You've got good taste.

652
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,660
My nickname in medical school was
'God-given body.'

653
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,530
What kind of a god?

654
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,220
I don't know what kind
of a god, either.

655
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,230
Pervert.

656
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,830
I didn't look at you undressed.

657
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,080
I looked at your face.

658
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,380
My face?
Why were you looking at my face?

659
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,850
Why?

660
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,910
Because you are pretty.

661
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:43,190
Your moonlit face was so pretty.

662
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,740
You have such good social skills.

663
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,170
You're pretty good.

664
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,900
Good.

665
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,940
I forgot the vegetable oil.

666
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,000
The convenience store is pricey.

667
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,680
Can you buy it from the supermarket
by the entrance to the alley?

668
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,790
Okay.

669
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,260
Here.

670
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,930
When is this Choco Pie from?

671
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,770
Who's this?

672
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,880
It's the best doctor, Professor Kim Do Han,
and his future wife.

673
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,860
It's been awhile, right?

674
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,490
It must have been about
20,000 years.

675
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,880
I understand that you can't
come to these shabby places.

676
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,650
Just get us the usual.

677
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,840
Okay, your usual cocktails,
but I'll choose the food.

678
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,360
Nothing has changed here.

679
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,630
Was this the table?

680
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,690
Where I asked you to date me
when I was drunk?

681
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,150
Was it?

682
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,730
What are you thinking these days?

683
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,730
Other than thinking about me.

684
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:27,790
Hospital.

685
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,020
Patients.

686
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,940
That's all.

687
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,740
I guess...

688
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,840
I'm half serious, and half joking.

689
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,210
- You should cheat on me.
- What?

690
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,850
Medically speaking, you seem like you
are in an emotional coma.

691
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,130
To break that, I think you need
something stimulating.

692
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,840
You can play around for awhile,
and come back to me.

693
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,370
Stop talking nonsense.

694
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,600
It's not nonsense.

695
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,870
It's a pretty good idea.

696
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,740
A doctor's life is always like this.

697
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,930
Sometimes it's boring and tiring.

698
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,450
But you recover from that.

699
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,780
I'm sure I'll come to enjoy
this repetitiveness one day.

700
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,090
Why can't I do this?

701
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,630
What are you doing
instead of getting the rice ready?

702
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,670
Did you see something here?

703
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,450
What?

704
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,960
A green scalpel.

705
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,450
I don't know.
I threw out all the mess there.

706
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,970
Are you missing something?

707
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,120
Where did you throw it out?

708
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,720
The trash can outside.

709
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,300
What is that?

710
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,940
Is it something important?

711
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,780
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,900
I was just cleaning,
and threw it out by accident.

713
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,170
Don't come to my house ever again.
You don't need to cook for me.

714
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:04,310
I'll just eat the triangular rolls.

715
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,790
Park Shi On!

716
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,800
Park Shi On!

717
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:20,230
<i>If you neglect your duties
because of this nonsense...</i>

718
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,080
<i>you'll be out, too.</i>

719
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,110
<i>Remember that.</i>

720
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,720
Yes.

721
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,650
Isn't this Ms. Cha Yoon Seo's
cell phone?

722
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:52,780
Yes, this is Ms. Cha Yoon Seo's
cell phone.

723
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,800
I'm Park Shi On.

724
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,950
Park Shi On, why are you
getting her calls?

725
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,390
Hold on a minute.

726
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,370
My bag...

727
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,420
You got a call from the professor.

728
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,600
Yes, professor.

729
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,480
Are you still acting as Park Shi On's
guardian at this hour?

730
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,510
What?

731
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,380
It's not that.

732
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,740
Why are you calling me?

733
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,710
Make sure you check Eun Ji's PT
tomorrow morning.

734
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,060
Okay.

735
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,230
I'm hanging up.

736
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,120
Tickle... Tickle...

737
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,890
Yi On.

738
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,020
Today...

739
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,390
I think I ran around the field
at least 10 times.

740
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,680
Are you still mad?

741
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:38,610
Don't be upset.
I said I'm sorry.

742
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,350
But, can you tell me
why you did that yesterday?

743
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,380
Was that from your first love?

744
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,230
I knew it!

745
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,060
Right?

746
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,230
Park Shi On, let's go to the NICU.

747
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,940
Okay!

748
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,140
He's acting all mighty...

749
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,110
I heard you've called for an
urgent meeting with the Ethics committee.

750
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,470
I guess it's about Manager Ko?

751
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:17,750
Yes.

752
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:24,310
I'm sure he may feel it's unfair,
but this is a grave matter.

753
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:31,050
Why don't you let it go for now?

754
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,460
Excuse me?

755
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,520
It won't look good if people
start talking about the pediatrics ward.

756
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,840
Then, you think we should
cover this up?

757
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:45,420
There was a disagreement between you
and the chairman of the board regarding Park Shi On.

758
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:51,220
It may appear that you are making
changes to get retaliation.

759
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,440
- That's nonsense.
- I know.

760
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,790
But the chairman is not
that understanding.

761
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,960
For the sake of the pediatrics ward
and Dr. Park...

762
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,670
please reconsider.

763
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,200
You don't have to worry.

764
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,560
His intestines are immature,
so movements are slow...

765
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,600
What do you mean?

766
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,810
A large portion of the intestine
has already been destroyed.

767
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:32,370
And, the baby's weight is only 550g.

768
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,710
His stomach doesn't look good, either.

769
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:40,390
In this condition,
surgery is not an option.

770
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:44,740
Even so... we should still try.

771
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,870
Maybe...

772
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,120
I'm sorry.

773
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:54,610
Even if we have the surgery, there's a
very low chance that the baby will survive.

774
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,750
Doctor.

775
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,820
No.

776
00:58:58,830 --> 00:58:59,980
No.

777
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,920
My baby...

778
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,330
It took us seven years
to have this baby.

779
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,690
We don't even have a name
for him, yet.

780
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,710
Even if you go to another hospital,
they will say the same thing.

781
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:18,060
Please prepare yourselves
for the worst.

782
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:47,550
May I ask why the meeting
was cancelled?

783
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,960
We may be harming ourselves by
calling attention to Manager Ko's deeds.

784
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,140
So, I want to settle this quietly
with a grave warning.

785
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,640
A warning is not enough.

786
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,610
It was a patient's life.

787
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,990
I know what you are saying.
But...

788
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,740
Manager Ko is our family, too.

789
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,430
Since when?

790
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:10,510
Whether we like him or not,
he's the manager of the pediatrics ward.

791
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,920
Is it because of Park Shi On?

792
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,520
Are you covering him up because
he allowed Park Shi On to get accepted?

793
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,910
What are you saying?

794
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,820
I can't watch you like this
because of Park Shi On anymore.

795
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,570
Park Shi On.
I'll handle him.

796
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,290
Hey...

797
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:06,290
Do Han, please take care of Shi On.

798
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,930
That's the last request from
your teacher.

799
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,200
That's why they hired him.

800
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,670
It's their way to get rid of
the director.

801
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:23,270
Professor, is something wrong?

802
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,750
Kim Do Han!

803
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:35,920
I told you not to act all arrogant.

804
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,140
What are you talking about?
Let me go.

805
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,720
After I warned you, you
take my patient without permission?

806
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,220
What?

807
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,280
That's a misunderstanding.
I haven't gone back...

808
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,450
Shut up!

809
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:10,170

810
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,750
We have an interesting new rookie.

811
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:29,630
I'm the doctor here.
Me, Kim Do Han!

812
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,760
Does the pediatric department
barter children now?

813
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,850
Are you serious?

814
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:38,090
That's the problem with proud men.
If you provoke them they fly off the handle.

815
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,150
Since when did Doctor Park Shi On
start flirting?

816
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:45,080
Why did you do that?
You shouldn't do that.

817
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,160
It seems like everyone
hates me...

818
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,430
You can't get attached to
the babies.

819
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,590
- You should just want to save them.
- I can feel it.

820
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:57,820
That baby wants to live.
