1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,153
Good Doctor

2
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:18,854
Why are you following us?

3
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,946
You dumb kid.
You deserve to get beat.

4
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,807
I said stop!

5
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,896
Who do you think you are?

6
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:50,296
You want to die?

7
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:56,622
Are you okay?

8
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:59,033
Get up.

9
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,405
Are you hurt anywhere else?

10
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,284
Let me see.

11
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,220
Hey!

12
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,509
You should have asked if you
could play together.

13
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:41,350
Why were you getting beat up?

14
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,059
If you keep asking them,
they'll eventually play with you.

15
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:49,713
How much longer will you keep playing
with that bunny?

16
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:52,990
I can't keep on playing with you.

17
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,487
Lift your face.

18
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:09,496
Bastard!

19
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:13,360
You should just lock him up in the house.
Why are you getting a medical report?

20
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,346
We have to fix him.
I can't let him be like this.

21
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:19,153
Bitch!

22
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,124
Stop!

23
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:26,464
Stop!
I said stop!

24
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:28,728
- Stop!
- Bastard!

25
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,261
Yi On!

26
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:24,430
I think he's dead.

27
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,550
Then...

28
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,602
Did he go to heaven?

29
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:36,384
Yes, he went to heaven.

30
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:43,325
Is it possible for him
to not go to heaven?

31
00:05:44,443 --> 00:05:47,975
If we heal him before he dies,
then he doesn't have to go to heaven.

32
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:59,251
If I become a doctor....
can I make someone not go to heaven?

33
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,022
I... want to become a doctor, too.

34
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,490
Why are you alone again?

35
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,303
I told you to stay with the other kids
even if you get beat up.

36
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:07,571
Why do you keep carrying this
with you?

37
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,605
You should listen to me.

38
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:15,956
That way they won't call you dumb.

39
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,601
Follow me.

40
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:25,871
Hey, if you want to play with us,
there's a condition.

41
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,134
What is it?

42
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:33,940
If you go in there, there are ball bearings.
Bring one to me.

43
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,366
If I bring that out, you're
going to let Shi On be on your team.

44
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,319
- You won't bother him anymore, right?
- Fine.

45
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,768
We'll share our snacks,
and play games with him.

46
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:27,113
We just have to go there,
and take one ball bearing.

47
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,932
Here!

48
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:11,918
We found them!

49
00:10:56,842 --> 00:11:00,819
This egg is the one that
the old lady gave us before.

50
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:02,725
- Really?
- Yeah.

51
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:11,939
Put it in your mouth.

52
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,039
Then, all of a sudden...

53
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:11,128
there was a knock on
the hospital room door.

54
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:16,904
The child was so scared,
he stepped closer to lock the door.

55
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,901
One step.

56
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,955
Two steps.

57
00:12:20,955 --> 00:12:25,819
He got near, and was
about to touch the doorknob.

58
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:30,718
It felt like there was something
behind him.

59
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:33,550
As soon as he turned around!

60
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:41,488
That monster took the child
because he never took his medicine on time.

61
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:47,125
I'll take all of you.

62
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,991
So, make sure you take
your medicine on time.

63
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:53,737
- Got it?
- Okay.

64
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:36,035
All you have to do is employee restructuring
at the management office?

65
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:42,190
Too much manpower.

66
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,736
You know that's a big problem
at our hospital.

67
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,112
We are not a factory,
we are a hospital.

68
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,813
The patients' lives
depend on each employee's well-being.

69
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,408
It's good to think about
the patient's life...

70
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:57,655
but it interferes with the
hospital's well-being.

71
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:02,264
Bring me a new proposal.
Something that I can comprehend.

72
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,458
No problem.

73
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,350
Leave the station
and get on Line One.

74
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,209
There will be one stop.
About 1.9 km. Duration about 4 minutes.

75
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,656
Fare will be 1,150 won cash,
and 1,050 won by card.

76
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:13,067
Carotid.

77
00:15:13,835 --> 00:15:16,718
Artery.

78
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:22,312
Subclavian.

79
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:26,888
Vena cava.

80
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,120
Hyun Woo, wait for me.

81
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:29,838
Help me!

82
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:32,433
Help me!
Is anyone there?

83
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:34,895
Is anyone there?
Help me!

84
00:16:35,648 --> 00:16:39,848
- The cable came apart.
- Someone hurry, and help us!

85
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,494
One, two.

86
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,214
Fortunately, the glass missed his carotid artery.
But, the jugular vein was damaged.

87
00:16:58,816 --> 00:16:59,974
Hyun Woo.

88
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:03,326
His neck will be fine
as long as we stop the bleeding.

89
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,428
No!

90
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,251
If you press down that hard,
you'll put pressure on the air passageway.

91
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,283
And you have to put pressure
higher up.

92
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:19,282
Press down gently on this part.

93
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,747
<i>There may be damage to
the lungs and liver because of trauma.</i>

94
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,670
His pulse is normal.

95
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:56,949
<i>The child may get cardioplegia
due to shortage of air.</i>

96
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:58,968
<i>It's vital to check for breathing.</i>

97
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:01,733
<i>Inhale breath,
and check to see if the chest rises.</i>

98
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:05,268
<i>You must check to see
that the child is breathing.</i>

99
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:08,262
<i>Five star importance.</i>

100
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,690
<i>There's no response from
his right lung.</i>

101
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,822
<i>Possibility of tension pneumothorax.</i>

102
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:20,151
Give CPR every three seconds.

103
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:22,356
And make sure his chest rises.

104
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,172
We don't have any scalpels or tubes.
What do we do?

105
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,958
<i>You must cut by following the
upper part of rib number five.</i>

106
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,352
<i>That way you won't damage
the vessels and nerves.</i>

107
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,798
What are you doing?

108
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:09,364
I think he's opening up the closed lung,
so he can breathe.

109
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:20,880
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

110
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:25,882
Bring me the
pediatric intubation set.

111
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:46,346
<i>His stomach keeps bloating up.</i>

112
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:48,256
<i>It seems there is heavy bleeding
inside his stomach.</i>

113
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:52,496
<i>Because a child has a much smaller volume,
this may be enough to kill him.</i>

114
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:55,932
<i>Immediate intravenous injection needed.
Four star importance.</i>

115
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:58,952
<i>Before then,
I must find his blood vessel.</i>

116
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,406
Why don't you continue
after moving him to the car.

117
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:04,871
No, we don't have time.
And, it can't be done inside a shaky car.

118
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,337
Give me the liquid.
Hurry, quick.

119
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:12,154
<i>Children have thin vessels.
It's hard to find them.</i>

120
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:16,914
<i>It's even harder when the child
has been bleeding heavily.</i>

121
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:21,196
<i>He is in a state of hypovolemic shock.
Intravenous injection is needed.</i>

122
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:24,231
I can't find the vessels. We have to
give the injection through bone marrow.

123
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:26,042
Do you have an IO needle?

124
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,225
We don't have that.

125
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:33,015
<i>Then, IJ cutdown.</i>

126
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:42,878
<i>If you can't find the child's vessels,
and there's no IO needle</i>

127
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:48,105
<i>excise the jugular vein to give the injection.
Three star importance.</i>

128
00:20:55,657 --> 00:20:59,331
Squeeze the liquid in.
It will be absorbed more quickly.

129
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:00,331
Yes.

130
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:11,087
You'll be fine, Hyun Woo.
Don't worry.

131
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,186
Hyun Woo.

132
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:23,412
Please hurry and get him
to a hospital.

133
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,648
Sir.

134
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:33,931
Please go with us.

135
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:37,020
What?
I have somewhere to go.

136
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,694
Please, sir.

137
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:42,946
For my sake, please.

138
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,289
Excuse me.

139
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:01,756
I need to get to
Sung Won University Hospital.

140
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:05,798
That's where we are headed.
Are you a doctor there?

141
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:07,651
What?

142
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:10,699
Yes.

143
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:19,625
Mr. Park Shi On has excellent
qualifications to become a doctor.

144
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,544
What basis do you have?

145
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:26,922
Mr. Park Shi On suffers from
Savant Syndrome.

146
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:38,142
As you probably know, people with
savant syndrome are autistic people

147
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:42,452
who show ingenious abilities in
specific areas.

148
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:51,707
Mr. Park shows this strength in
his memory skills and spatial intelligence.

149
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,207
<i>When I was working at Tae Bak Community
Health Center, I met Shi On coincidentally.</i>

150
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:06,806
<i>At the age of seven, he had already
memorized every part of the human body.</i>

151
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:10,219
<i>Using his spatial intelligence</i>

152
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:17,918
<i>he completely comprehended
the function and location of each organ.</i>

153
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,523
<i>He entered the medical school at
Song San University.</i>

154
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,783
He finished school,
and got accepted at the National Hospital.

155
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:30,635
Furthermore, he has finished his internship,
and will start his residency soon.

156
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:33,865
I see he had great grades
in medical school.

157
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:38,596
Yes, he is more qualified to be a
doctor than anyone else.

158
00:23:47,724 --> 00:23:50,422
Right...
My bag.

159
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:58,337
His pulse is going up!
Did he lose consciousness?

160
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:02,770
It's showing 100,
but why is he turning blue?

161
00:24:22,654 --> 00:24:24,299
Hyun Woo!

162
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:30,141
Hurry and check the echocardiography.

163
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:32,890
According to the monitor,
his heart is fine.

164
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,330
- Are you his guardian?
- He saved my child at the station.

165
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,861
- He's a doctor here.
- I've never seen you before.

166
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,752
Which department?

167
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,156
We have to check now.
Echo...

168
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:50,057
Stay here for now.
Just the guardian, please follow me.

169
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:52,997
Excuse me.

170
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:12,600
Eun Ji, I'll help you go through your
operation without getting scared.

171
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,900
Really?

172
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,648
Of course, the doctor you meet tomorrow
will make you brave.

173
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,503
I'm so scared.

174
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:24,487
What if I die in surgery?

175
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:29,510
I told you it would be okay.
Just trust this pretty doctor.

176
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,401
Who's pretty here?

177
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,530
Doctor.

178
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,624
She's scheduled for surgery tomorrow,
not the psychological therapy session.

179
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:42,104
I didn't give such orders.

180
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:44,924
I heard Dr. Kim Do Han ordered it.

181
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:46,832
What do we do?

182
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,137
- Dr. Cha!
- Get out!

183
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:59,748
Regarding Eun Ji...  We have to let her
take the psychological exam, first.

184
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:01,294
She's in critical condition.

185
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:05,050
If she doesn't have the surgery tomorrow,
I can't guarantee what will happen to her varix bleeding.

186
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,849
She needs psychological treatment
to get over her fear of surgery.

187
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,893
Don't you know
how serious this is for a child?

188
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:20,916
If all you want to do is care about kids,
just become a kindergarten teacher.

189
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:22,900
- Professor.
- Stop working with Eun Ji.

190
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,241
I'm not going to watch a patient die.

191
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,447
- Doctor.
- Let go.

192
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:39,209
Professor, still Dr. Cha...

193
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:43,515
It's an ER trauma patient.

194
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,327
He's bleeding heavily.

195
00:26:56,195 --> 00:27:00,856
The CT and X-ray doesn't look bad, but
there are lacerations on the liver and spleen.

196
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:06,685
There's hematoma around the internal
jugular vein, which may be signs of damage.

197
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:10,866
But, it seems the bleeding has stopped
for now. First aid was taken care of.

198
00:27:10,866 --> 00:27:14,597
- Get him prepared.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,682
<i>What are you doing?
You can't go in!</i>

200
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:20,951
Wait.
I have something to say.

201
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:23,412
What is it?
Are you the guardian?

202
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:26,575
- I don't think he's the guardian.
- There's no time.

203
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:29,730
- You have to hurry.
- Be quiet, this is the operating room.

204
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,550
Echo...

205
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:41,766
What is he saying?
I don't think he's quite normal.

206
00:27:56,013 --> 00:27:59,689
This is not good.
Something bad is going to happen.

207
00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:04,893
- Who took care of first aid?
- There was a doctor on the scene.

208
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,029
He did a good job.

209
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,960
But why did he puncture the jugular veins
to give the injection?

210
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,587
He attempted the IJ cutdown.

211
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:17,318
I don't know who it was,
but he knew pediatrics well.

212
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:25,429
People with mental disabilities
can't take the national exam.

213
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:30,868
How did he pass when he suffers
from autism?

214
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:36,632
Regarding his autism, he was
diagnosed as normal at the age of 17.

215
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,789
Hold on.

216
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:43,865
You said he passed the national test.
But, they overturned the scores.

217
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:48,270
That's why I scouted him.

218
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:54,524
They looked at his past medical history,
and failed him.

219
00:28:54,524 --> 00:29:02,127
But, regarding what you mentioned
about his mental illness, this is what it says.

220
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:09,117
If a professional doctor vouches for his
capabilities, he will be able to pass.

221
00:29:11,481 --> 00:29:18,546
The National Health Center will overturn his
failing score, if there's a verification of his ability.

222
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:21,594
This is their contract.

223
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:27,425
You are saying our hospital can
give that verification, right?

224
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:33,392
- Yes, through one year of residency.
- Then, is his autism under control?

225
00:29:34,396 --> 00:29:41,589
I can't say that it's totally cured, but
he won't have any troubles being a doctor.

226
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:45,226
What do you mean that he's not
totally cured?

227
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:53,118
He's very capable of being a doctor...

228
00:29:53,118 --> 00:30:00,127
but he lacks in social
and communication skills.

229
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:04,115
Are you saying that he's
psychologically immature?

230
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:07,191
How ridiculous.

231
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:15,298
Even if he is being treated, I believe
it's impossible for him to act as a doctor.

232
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,705
You think our hospital is some
rehabilitation center for handicaps?

233
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:25,023
- How dare you bring someone like this...
- Watch what you are saying, please.

234
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:30,729
Let's meet him first, and talk.

235
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:35,578
It's been over 30 minutes,
and he hasn't arrived yet.

236
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:00,611
Suction.

237
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:07,892
Fortunately, there's no critical damage.
If we treat the punctured area, he'll be fine.

238
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:20,761
Check for his vitals.

239
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:23,530
BP 50/30.
There's a sudden drop.

240
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,971
The saturation is maintained.

241
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:26,975
It must be a heart problem.

242
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,495
- His echo?
- We didn't check.

243
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:31,356
Nothing seemed wrong
with his heart.

244
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:35,002
Echo...

245
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,236
Echocardiography.
Prepare right now.

246
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:41,273
Yes.

247
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:45,076
- Should we prepare the defibrillator?
- Not yet.

248
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,393
Echo...
Peri...

249
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,198
Pericardial effusion.

250
00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:57,888
It's all set.

251
00:31:57,888 --> 00:32:01,417
Prepare the pericardial paracentesis.

252
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:59,047
<i>Pericardial puncture is not easy with children.
The angle can get narrow.</i>

253
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:02,080
It'll be impossible to perform a
pericardial puncture.

254
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,341
Next procedure.

255
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,514
Scalpel.

256
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,402
This patient has cardiac tamponade.

257
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:22,878
He's got an internal wound due to external
damage. It's due to heavy internal bleeding.

258
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:28,014
<i>For cardiac tamponade, you must
lower the pressure with pericardiotomy.</i>

259
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:31,124
Suction.

260
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:35,608
He's bleeding heavily.

261
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:42,001
<i>If heavy bleeding continues
because of pericardiotomy...</i>

262
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,071
If it continues...

263
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,790
<i>You need to open the chest.</i>

264
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,024
After opening the chest,
you must find the source of bleeding.

265
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:54,554
<i>After suction, prepare for
thoracoabdominal incision.</i>

266
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:15,326
The majority rules that we will not hire
Mr. Park Shi On as a temporary doctor.

267
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:31,180
What is he doing?

268
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,187
I don't know.
He's been like that for two hours.

269
00:34:34,187 --> 00:34:36,066
I don't think he's normal.

270
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,595
<i>If you can't locate the source of
bleeding quickly</i>

271
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:42,233
<i>the blood pressure will drop,
and lead to cardiac arrest.</i>

272
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:47,118
The blood pressure is dropping.
It's a cardiac arrest.

273
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,892
Increase the vasopressor.
Quickly!

274
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:59,810
<i>Prepare the defibrillator.</i>

275
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,831
Step aside.

276
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:03,754
Shock.

277
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,860
Shock.

278
00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:12,620
The heart rate has returned.

279
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:16,627
Metzenbaum.

280
00:35:20,768 --> 00:35:24,759
<i>Open up the heart more,
and search for the puncture.</i>

281
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:28,839
The bleeding is coming from the area
connecting the superior vena cava

282
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,633
and the right atrium.

283
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:54,716
Suture the wound.
Vital check.

284
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:58,211
Bleeding has stopped.

285
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:01,197
- It's normal.
- Good job.

286
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:04,945
- You can finish it up.
- Yes, sir.

287
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:19,611
Guardian for Lee Hyun Woo?

288
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:21,696
Yes, sir?

289
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,750
The surgery went well.

290
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:32,348
The bleeding in the liver and spleen are under
control. Same goes for the neck.

291
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:35,661
The puncture occurred at pericardium,
so it was a bit risky

292
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:38,103
but fortunately,
everything went well.

293
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,166
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

294
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:44,869
Thanks, Hyun Woo.

295
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:51,774
But, do you know the doctor
that took care of the first aid?

296
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:56,689
He was just here.

297
00:36:56,689 --> 00:37:00,424
I heard he's a doctor here.

298
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,827
Really?

299
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:16,990
Sir.

300
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:20,170
What's wrong with you?

301
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:39,636
You're normally so good with your time.
Why are you late?

302
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:42,408
And what's wrong with your clothes?

303
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:46,359
A kid got injured at the train station,
so I was helping him.

304
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,102
Is the kid okay?

305
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:50,558
Yes, he's fine.

306
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,037
Shi On.

307
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,122
Listen carefully.

308
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:03,411
But, how did he know that
it was pericardial tamponade?

309
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:06,206
I didn't even imagine.

310
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:09,859
You couldn't tell by
the X-ray or CT. Right?

311
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,778
He could have died
if something went wrong.

312
00:38:13,522 --> 00:38:16,063
Our professor is the best.

313
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:20,735
Right! Didn't they say we were getting
a new resident today?

314
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,554
I hope he comes quickly,
so I can go home!

315
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,120
I know, me too.

316
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:44,849
Echo...

317
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:48,669
Peri...

318
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:58,745
Do you want to stay here?

319
00:38:58,745 --> 00:38:59,841
No.

320
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,554
You're hungry, right?

321
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:02,853
No.

322
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:08,869
Really?

323
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:12,632
Then, I guess I'll go alone to
have some beef stew.

324
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:21,218
Are you talking about the top rated beef stew
made with pine nuts and chestnuts?

325
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:22,669
Yeah, that.

326
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:24,414
But, you said you're not hungry.

327
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:29,888
I'm fine, but I think my conditioned
reflexes are not functioning properly.

328
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:36,150
You won't need to get
involved in these matters anymore.

329
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:41,601
He's right. You don't need to
worry about hiring a mere resident.

330
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:47,709
The late chairman of the board
involved himself with hiring even an intern.

331
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:50,764
Our doctors are not employees,
they are family.

332
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,672
What's going on now?
Is something wrong?

333
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,457
Excuse me.

334
00:40:06,601 --> 00:40:08,275
What's going on?

335
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:13,241
Around noon today, a child was
seriously injured at Chung Ryang Station.

336
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:17,140
A surgeon at this hospital
saved the child.

337
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,466
So, we want to have an
interview with that doctor.

338
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:23,686
I see.
What's his name?

339
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:29,165
We don't know that, either.
We just heard that he's a doctor here.

340
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,455
I see.

341
00:40:46,145 --> 00:40:49,658
This is all yours.
Eat slowly.

342
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,062
Okay.

345
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:05,523
<i>A child collapsed after getting
hit by a dropped ad sign.</i>

346
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:11,400
<i>At the moment of life and death, a doctor
passing by performed first aid with great skills.</i>

347
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,485
<i>The citizens watching nearby
sighed a relief and cheered for him.</i>

348

anonymous doctor's good deed</i>

349

350

<i>The entire world is watching...</i>

351
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:28,232
Yes, sir.

352
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:37,134
In the history of our foundation,
we've never overturned the board's voting.

353
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:41,771
There's always an exception.
Not only domestically, but abroad as well.

354
00:41:41,771 --> 00:41:44,690
And, I heard he's our own doctor.

355
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:50,247
Don't you think it's nonsense that
we would hire him for that one reason?

356
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:55,447
It's not only for marketing purposes.
I'm speaking out for his talent as a doctor.

357
00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:57,960
Chairman of the board.

358
00:41:58,384 --> 00:42:03,258
Autism causes both mental
and living difficulties for the patient.

359
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:09,168
He won't be easily cured.
Even if he is cured, there's a definite limit.

360
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:12,890
I think there's definite cause
to reconsider.

361
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,359
No way!

362
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:18,291
Our hospital may become
a laughing stock.

363
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,090
Give him an opportunity
for six months.

364
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:31,167
In that time, if there's any trouble or if
we see that he's incapable of being a doctor

365
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:38,198
I will resign from my position
as the director of the hospital.

366
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:47,657
As mentioned, autism does add
difficulties to one's life.

367
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:51,122
However, it's not incurable.

368
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:57,131
It is dependent on the patient's condition,
but it's curable.

369
00:42:57,131 --> 00:43:00,591
Mr. Park Shi On is such a case.

370
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:06,157
The focus is not whether we
hire a handicapped man or not.

371
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:14,642
We would be giving hope to all of the
autistic patients and families in this country.

372
00:43:15,837 --> 00:43:20,989
Please be generous
in your reconsideration.

373
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:57,417
Here is a question.

374
00:43:57,417 --> 00:44:00,593
Why do you want to become
a doctor here?

375
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:06,310
It's because of
a bunny and my brother.

376
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:12,460
The day that the tree
smelled like ice cream...

377
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,703
my bunny went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

378
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:20,897
The day the railroad tracks
smelled like rusting irons...

379
00:44:20,897 --> 00:44:25,412
my brother went to heaven
in front of my eyes.

380
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:29,666
Neither one had a chance
to become an adult.

381
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:33,408
I wanted to let them
become adults.

382
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:39,737
I wanted them to have kids
of their own, and love those kids.

383
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:44,615
I wanted that for them
more than anything.

384
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:50,193
I also want to earn a lot of money

385
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:55,998
so I can buy a 3D television for
the kids from my childhood orphanage.

386
00:44:55,998 --> 00:45:01,626
Those children have never seen one.
I want to show it to them.

387
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:18,622
As of today, we will employ Mr. Park Shi On
as a temporary resident in the pediatric ward.

388
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:22,532
Welcome, Dr. Park Shi On.

389
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:26,071
I welcome you as well,
Dr. Park Shi On.

390
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,074
I've never seen you
acting so rashly.

391
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:54,858
At times, you need to be rash
for a just cause.

392
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:59,303
You can get in danger
because of him.

393
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:03,479
From the beginning, this was not about
Mr. Shi On. It was a power game.

394
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:07,305
I don't know anything about that.

395
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:12,137
You need to.
They are anxious to --> 00:55:40,082
At least you know it.

396
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,758
Should I make the next drink 50/50,
so you can just get drunk?

397
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:48,843
No.

398
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,791
Make soju and beer,
7 to 3 ratio.

399
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:56,786
Okay.

400
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,729
Yes.

401
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:06,518
<i>Where are you?</i>

402
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,566
Library.

403
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:10,043
<i>Are you drinking again?</i>

404
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,844
A little bit.

405
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:15,426
Are you still angry?

406
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:16,924
Why are you doing this?

407
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:19,078
Are you trying to make me
feel better?

408
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:22,945
No. I want you to repent for
what you did wrong today.

409
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:24,237
What?

410
00:56:24,237 --> 00:56:28,015
Drinking and covering up your faults
doesn't help you at all.

411
00:56:28,848 --> 00:56:31,337
<i>Stop drinking, and prepare for
tomorrow's surgery.</i>

412
00:56:31,337 --> 00:56:32,447
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

413
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:35,001
Hello?

414
00:56:37,348 --> 00:56:38,554
Seriously...

415
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,436
This bastard!

416
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:47,845
Hey, mix it all up.

417
00:56:47,845 --> 00:56:51,016
All the liquor in the house,
mix it all up!

418
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:40,870
You should have called first.
I would have come back sooner.

419
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,392
It's fine.

420
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:45,436
Did you go somewhere?
Why are you wearing a black suit?

421
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:47,660
I had a meeting in the morning.

422
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:52,554
I was trying to vote him out
for the director's sake.

423
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:55,367
For his sake?

424
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:58,705
If they didn't hire him,
this would have just passed by.

425
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:01,545
But, the director
is risking everything.

426
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:07,696
If the new doctor makes a mistake,
he's going to resign from his position.

427
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:10,455
- Resign?
- That's why they let him get hired.

428
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:13,839
It's their way to get rid of the director.

429
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:19,327
The stupid executive manager didn't
catch on, so he kept going against them.

430
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,793
And the vice president is
completely for him.

431
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:25,631
The vice president is
above everyone else.

432
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:27,068
Why...

433
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:32,639
He sometimes does things
out of the blue.

434
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:34,533
And the results were always good.

435
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:38,922
Anyway, I'm concerned about the
vice president.

436
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:40,706
Why?

437
00:58:40,706 --> 00:58:45,040
He's the only one that I can't read.

438
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:58,036
Kim Do Han,
this bastard.

439
00:58:58,036 --> 00:58:59,611
<i>Hey!</i>

440
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:01,972
<i>If you are drunk,
go home and sleep!</i>

441
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:06,169
Where's that coming from?

442
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:11,016
Do you have an amp in your throat?
Why's your voice so loud?

443
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:15,314
<i>Look at this girl! If you don't
stop, I'm going to call the cops!</i>

444
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:16,497
Do it.

445
00:59:16,497 --> 00:59:19,053
Let me go for a drive
in the backseat.

446
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,052
So annoying.

447
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:38,248
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

448
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:41,720
Happy birthday to you.

449
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:46,147
Happy birthday, dear my brother.

450
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:49,354
Happy birthday to you.

451
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,352
What are you doing?

452
00:59:54,176 --> 00:59:55,403
Blow it out.

453
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:15,235
I saved up my allowance
to buy that.

454
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:17,600
You said you want to become a doctor.

455
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:21,660
You can do it.

456
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,409
Because you are my brother.
Right?

457
01:00:25,517 --> 01:00:29,269
Yeah, because I'm your brother.

458
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,138
Shi On.

459
01:00:32,903 --> 01:00:36,026
You are not dumb.

460
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:41,074
You are much, much, smarter than me.

461
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:43,951
You'll be a great doctor.

462
01:00:44,634 --> 01:00:50,110
Later, when mom and I are sick,
you'll have to cure us.

463
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,132
Okay?

464
01:01:08,775 --> 01:01:10,284
Slowly.

465
01:01:42,685 --> 01:01:44,619
Bastard.

466
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:48,520
I'm trying to cover up my wrong doing?

467
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:53,883
Seriously...

468
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,238
How appalling.

469
01:01:58,576 --> 01:02:00,156
Kim Do Han.

470
01:02:00,777 --> 01:02:06,245
I don't like anything about you,
except for your looks.

471
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:28,902
Excuse me.

472
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:31,633
Get out of here!

473
01:02:32,212 --> 01:02:34,623
You're trying to discipline me again?

474
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,582
Such a showoff.

475

476
01:04:04,058 --> 01:04:05,824
This is the new resident.

477
01:04:05,824 --> 01:04:06,934
Aren't you taking notes?

478
01:04:06,934 --> 01:04:09,051
I am here. In here.

479
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:11,782
Don't be mad.
I said I was sorry.

480
01:04:11,782 --> 01:04:13,844
Listen to me carefully.

481
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:16,211
Don't be cocky.
Follow the rules.

482
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:18,261
Do you want your teeth
knocked out?

483
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:20,070
It's dangerous for the patient.

484
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,088
- I'll do it.
- You can't do this Dr. Park!

485
01:04:23,498 --> 01:04:25,917
Do you realize what you've
just done?
