<i>Episode 18</i>

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,780
Scalpel.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,220
Professor Kim.

5
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,070
Professor Kim.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,980
Are you okay?

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,890
Professor Kim!

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,210
Professor Kim,
get a hold of yourself!

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,350
Professor Kim!

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm fine.

11
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,640
Professor Kim!

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,910
The wound must have gotten infected.
Right?

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,320
Bring him out immediately.

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,560
I'm fine.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,150
Not in this condition.

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,240
Hold me up.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,600
- Professor Kim.
- Now!

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,770
- Dr. Cha, you perform the surgery.
- Excuse me?

19
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,390
And, Dr. Han...

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,340
- You will be the first assistant.
- Pardon?

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,890
I will stay in the operating room.

22
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,620
You all will become my hands
and my eyes.

23
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,760
Do you understand?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,420
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,290
Dr. Cha, start the laparotomy,
and locate the gallbladder.

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,780
You must approach the adhesion carefully.

27
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,370
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,910
Scalpel.

29
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,270
Army navy.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,260
One more.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,090
Forceps.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,530
Get me the right angle.

33
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,670
The intestinal adhesion is more serious
than we thought.

34
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,360
It won't be easy to approach it.

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,550
Park Shi On, estimate the area
of the adhesion.

36
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,060
Okay.

37
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,330
We should start with this area.

38
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,560
Be careful not to damage the
small and large intestines.

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,720
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,750
- I've located the gallbladder.
- I'll set the catheter.

41
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,620
- Make it longer.
- Isn't this long enough?

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,390
We can't operate on the child with a
new catheter each time he grows.

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,340
- Put in enough from the start.
- Dr. Cha is right.

44
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,540
Put in a long one.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,330
Cut.

46
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,980
I will insert the catheter.

47
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,470
If the bile leaks,
it will be problematic.

48
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,030
What should we do to prevent that,
Park Shi On?

49
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,360
Two purse string sutures,
and also tunneling.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,470
That's right.

51
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,340
Do just that.

52
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,810
The catheter is inserted.

53
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,070
Good.

54
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,500
- Finish, and close him up.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,740
Dr. Cha, good job.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,220
You did much better than myself.

57
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,420
- No.
- Everyone, good job.

58
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,010
Good job!

59
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,890
Whether the result was
successful or not...

60
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,360
- that wasn't a perfect surgery.
- If you only look on the outside...

61
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,130
You're right.

62
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,130
But, I was sure.

63
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,120
That we would succeed.

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,270
Joon Young gave me this.

65
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,760
This was the ball he used
for his first hit.

66
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,280
I had it in my pocket during the surgery.
I kept thinking about this.

67
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,000
And because of this...

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,570
I couldn't leave the operating room.

69
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,920
Our team...

70
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,830
We enter that operating room
thinking about the children's future.

71
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,740
Unless we give up on the
children's future...

72
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,620
there's no reason for us to
give up on the surgery.

73
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,690
Hold still.

74
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,500
Aren't you embarrassed as the
top surgeon in our hospital?

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,910
Letting your wound get infected...

76
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,640
What's this?

77
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,820
Don't say anything.
Just treat it.

78
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,160
Getting stabbed for the sake
of a patient...

79
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,850
Getting the wound infected...

80
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,240
And the surgery on top of that...
Do you think you're Iron Man?

81
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,620
Even Iron Man thinks about
his own health.

82
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,270
You talk so much.

83
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,450
Unless you want to get hospitalized,
you should go home and rest.

84
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,380
There's no need.

85
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,120
You should take my advice!

86
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,980
Do you want to collapse again?

87
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,910
You'll only be a nuisance.

88
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,250
Nuisance.

89
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,490
Hold still.

90
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,530
His condition is worsening.

91
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,980
Soon, it will be hard for him
to move around.

92
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,270
You should visit him often.

93
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,410
You don't have much time.

94
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,580
Shi On.

95
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,950
I think I should take your father,
and go down to Tae Back.

96
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,850
What do you mean?

97
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,730
There's nothing else
that the hospital can do for him.

98
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,610
What good would it do
to stay here?

99
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,020
To you and to the director...
We are being a burden.

100
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,770
You can't do that.
You can't go.

101
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,730
If you are alone with him,
he may hit you again.

102
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,100
He won't do that anymore.

103
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,310
Soon, he won't even be able
to move around.

104
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,410
No.

105
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,550
Still, you can't do that.

106
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,830
Good job.

107
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,660
It'll be better for him to stay here
to lessen the pain.

108
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,870
You were thinking about
your mother, too.

109
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,620
I feel bad for both of them.

110
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,990
I feel bad for dad who lived alone
after mom left.

111
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,580
And I feel bad for mom who fled
from getting beaten by dad.

112
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,030
But, I'm getting mad thinking about
how I feel bad for them.

113
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,550
I'm very very angry.

114
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,350
Why?

115
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:04,340
If they abandoned me and lived alone
for 20 years, they should be happy.

116
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,780
If they lived without a stupid child
like me...

117
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,700
they should have led a comfortable life.

118
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,900
- Shi On.
- They are the ones who are stupid.

119
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,500
Mom and dad, both.

120
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,450
I feel better that you are angry.

121
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,430
I feel like I can count on you.

122
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,550
It seems like you now have the strength
to take care of your parents.

123
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,370
They can count on you now.

124
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,590
Please, Chairman...

125
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,710
All of the financial institutions
are turning us down.

126
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,200
When everything returns to normal,
we'll repay you.

127
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,390
Please.

128
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,090
I'm sorry, Chairwoman Lee.
I don't have any money I can spare.

129
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,590
I should pay you back for everything
that the late chairman did for me...

130
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,250
but right now, I can't do that.
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,810
He can't spare any money?

132
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,060
He's got a corporation that makes
over 100 billion won in LCD sales alone.

133
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,860
Forget it.

134
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,140
It doesn't make any sense.

135
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,830
Who helped him from going bankrupt
20 years ago?

136
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,690
Who can we blame?

137
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,630
It's all my fault.

138
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,580
Chae Kyung.

139
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,920
Thank you.

140
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,300
For staying by my side.

141
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,770
It's the video file for the pyriform sinus fistula
surgery that you asked for.

142
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,890
I see.

143
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,430
I heard your surgery was
very impressive.

144
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,020
Oh...

145
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,750
I know your fellowship years are hard.
But those times...

146
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,090
are crucial for a surgeon.

147
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,680
I'm doing fine.

148
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,030
But, Dr. Cha...

149
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,310
- Were you always this pretty?
- Excuse me?

150
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,960
Since what age were you this pretty?

151
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,180
Three years old?
Ten?

152
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,070
Since birth?

153
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,670
If I do say so myself...

154
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,080
- It was since birth.
- I knew it!

155
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,190
I knew you were a natural born beauty.

156
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,750
Have a good day.

157
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,760
Yes...

158
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,770
It's back to normal now.

159
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,200
From now on, make sure you don't
skip any medication.

160
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Do you understand?

161
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,730
Yes.

162
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,380
Why are you staring at me like that?

163
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,880
It's nothing.

164
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,870
Dr. Park.

165
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,460
I...

166
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,440
When I grow up, do you
think I'll be pretty like In Young?

167
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,330
You are already pretty.

168
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,020
- Then who's prettier, Dr. Cha or me?
- Dr. Cha.

169
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,110
That was so fast.

170
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to respond so quickly.

171
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,900
What's wrong?

172
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,590
What's bothering you about
In Hye's condition?

173
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,810
I can't pinpoint what it is.

174
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,820
It feels like I left the house with the gas on.
Like I left the PC store without logging off.

175
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,590
And like I ate triangular rolls
without checking the expiration date.

176
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,690
- How can I understand if you say that?
- We can't have the surgery yet.

177
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,950
We should thoroughly examine her
before having the surgery.

178
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,360
There wasn't anything wrong
when we ran the tests two weeks ago.

179
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,500
And it's not enough to go
just on a hunch.

180
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,650
The HPB department can operate on In Young.
But, can we operate on In Hye?

181
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,860
I want to do that, too.

182
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,990
Dr. Cha.

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,740
I have a request.

184
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,590
What is it?

185
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,490
Tell me you will okay it.

186
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,130
Dr. Park here is in charge of In Hye.
He has something to tell you.

187
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,840
What is it?

188
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,320
Compared to other patients,
In Hye's always been more prone to infections.

189
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,800
That means that her immune system
is not great.

190
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,550
If she happens to have the idiosyncratic form,
she may get infected during the transplant.

191
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,420
And considering that it's a pediatric transplant,
we need to prepare...

192
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,200
These guys...

193
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,850
Did you hear or not?

194
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,750
Who are you to say anything
when your leader is quiet?

195
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,710
No...

196
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,720
- We just wanted you to consider...
- Cha Yoon Seo.

197
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,810
Worry about yourself.

198
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,540
You should worry about
not causing another table death.

199
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,900
How can you say that?

200
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,810
I don't want to hear
that kind of an insulting comment.

201
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,410
- You should apologize to Dr. Cha...
- What?

202
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,470
Dr. Park.

203
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,400
We'll be going.

204
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,890
Listen to him talk...

206
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,620
Hey!

207
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,720
Where are you going?

208
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,510
I'm going to make him apologize.

209
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,680
Why are you so easy to anger
these days?

210
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,210
It's okay if he says something
bad about me.

211
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,730
But I can't stand to see him
talk badly about you!

212
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,770
Here.

213
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,550
Don't look so mad.

214
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,090
I feel nauseous.

215
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:46,310
Why do you want to put me in the
chairman position for the Sung Won Foundation?

216
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:53,680
There's nobody else who knows about
the hospital and the foundation as much as you.

217
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,340
You devoted your whole life
to the foundation.

218
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,350
Chairwoman Lee and General Manager Yoo
are the ones who betrayed you.

219
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,310
I don't doubt that you'll
do a good job.

220
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,250
Please reconsider.
He's not fit for a chairman position.

221
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,010
It's only temporary.

222
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,230
I'll kick him out once we are done
with personnel restructuring.

223
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,400
Didn't you guarantee succession
for existing employees?

224
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,780
Situations always change.

225
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,880
<i>If anything goes wrong,
call me right away.</i>

226
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,530
Seriously...

227
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:01,540
I told you to go home!

228
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,110
I'm going to check this,
and then leave.

229
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,500
Why do I get so many complaints that
the sheets don't get changed in time?

230
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,420
We're short staffed because all
the rooms are full.

231
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,430
Again?

232
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,140
Another excuse?

233
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,450
- If I get another claim...
- Boss!

234
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,760
Hyung Mi.

235
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,800
Do you know how much
I've been looking for you?

236
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,590
How did you find me?

237
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,090
- Oh my...
- You still haven't lost your touch.

238
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,840
You're still great!

239
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,960
Who are these people, Senior?

240
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,080
Why are you talking to our
boss like that?

241
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,640
How dare you?

242
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,810
Hey!

243
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,010
She's just calling me Senior.

244
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,970
Follow me.

245
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,270
Consider me dead.

246
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,130
- Don't come here anymore.
- Boss.

247
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,150
I'm not going to use my fists anymore.

248
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,110
I want to live here happily
with the children.

249
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,100
If you come here again,
I'll crush all of you.

250
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,430
Hyung Mi.

251
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,730
You should stop your ways,
and live like a human being.

252
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,510
Like a human being.

253
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,320
Boss.

254
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,430
Oh my God...

255
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,680
They were my neighborhood friends
from my childhood.

256
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,870
Who knew they would come visit?

257
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,900
Nurse Nam.

258
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,990
I'm busy.
I have to go.

259
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,950
Joon Young...

260
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,320
The surgery went well.

261
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,560
But, there's something I didn't tell you.

262
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,310
What is it?

263
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,620
It'll be hard for you to continue
playing baseball.

264
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,860
You can't move around too vigorously.

265
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,740
I knew that.

266
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,490
How?

267
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,000
Joon Young.

268
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:35,030
I know that you are sad because
you can't fulfill your dreams.

269
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,340
But, you know what's great
about dreams?

270
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,630
The fact that you can have
other dreams.

271
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,160
Just as you dream when you're sleeping...
you can have other dreams.

272
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,280
You are not abandoning your dreams,
just dreaming again.

273
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,230
Look.

274
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,330
This is the first ball
that you hit.

275
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,180
You can make another 'first'.

276
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,230
I don't know what that is yet.

277
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,500
But you have to give me that
as a gift later on.

278
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,670
Okay?

279
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,920
That's why I decided to
dream a different dream.

280
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:38,510
I'm going to study hard,
and become a baseball reporter.

281
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,830
I'm sorry, Dad.

282
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,240
I thought you would be worried
if you knew.

283
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,760
That's why I didn't tell you.

284
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,890
It's okay.

285
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,610
Joon Young, you are so cool.

286
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,630
Hello.

287
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,090
My name is Park Shi On,
and I'll be in charge of Seung Hyun.

288
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,120
I see.
Please take good care of him.

289
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,050
If you need anything let me know.

290
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,980
Okay.

291
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,970
But, you talk sort of funny.

292
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,100
Yes.

293
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,250
Did Seung Hyun urinate?

294
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,430
No.

295
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,440
Then, he must urinate quickly.
It's not good to keep it in for too long.

296
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,580
I'm sorry.

297
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,720
I have a lot of surgeries.
It's hard for me to make time.

298
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,950
Yes, it's hard to check
my text messages, too.

299
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,260
Yes.

300
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,150
Okay.
Good bye.

301
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,010
Okay.

302
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,430
Why didn't you make any sound?

303
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,220
Were you talking to
Prosecutor Voldemort?

304
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,490
Oh...

305
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,250
Yeah, he wanted to see me again.

306
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,640
I see.

307
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,600
Are you going to meet him again?

308
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,880
No!
Why would I?

309
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,590
Then, why didn't you tell him that
when you were on the phone?

310
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,520
You should make it clear that
you don't like him.

311
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,740
That's true.

312
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,150
I'll do that next time he calls.

313
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,340
But, why were you eavesdropping?

314
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,390
I wasn't eavesdropping.
I heard it even outside the door.

315
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,610
Then, you should have
blocked your ears.

316
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,870
Did Professor Kim go home?

317
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,810
Yes.

318
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,320
Oh, right!

319
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,900
Did you hear what
Professor Kim said to Joon Young?

320
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,580
About dreams?

321
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,040
It's abalone porridge.
You should eat.

322
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,600
You are taking strong medicine,
so you need to eat.

323
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,440
Why aren't you on call at the hospital?
Who gave you permission to come out?

324
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,980
I didn't think you would eat
if you were alone.

325
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,460
I know well because I live alone.

326
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,960
I don't eat sometimes because
it's bothersome.

327
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,270
You're too relaxed.
I must have been too lenient on you.

328
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,510
No, I'm not too relaxed.
I'll go to the hospital right after.

329
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,040
Oh, right!

330
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,170
I heard about what you said to
Joon Young.

331
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,500
About dreams...

332
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,450
It was so very touching.

333
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,600
- You are such a great doc...
- Don't you dare put it up!

334
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,990
Oh...

335
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,880
You should go in.

337
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,760
Okay.

338
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,800
But, you are like a big brother to me.

339
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,120
Since the day you saved me
from those thugs.

340
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,740
My brother did the same for me.

341
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,600
I'm always thankful.

342
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,850
I'll be quickly leaving then.

343
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,640
Your fever's all down,
so you'll be getting the surgery soon.

344
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,310
You still don't want to
get the surgery?

345
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,260
No.

346
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,790
Then, are you still in a bad mood?

347
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,470
Dr. Han.

348
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,480
I...

349
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,450
All of a sudden,
I'm afraid of dying.

350
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,370
Why would you think that?

351
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,120
When I fainted at
Dr. Cha's house.

352
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,450
It was for a second, but I felt it.

353
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,810
I felt fear.

354
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,380
I felt like everything in this world
was disappearing.

355
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,660
In Hye.

356
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,630
Don't worry about that.

357
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,180
Dr. Han.

358
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,970
Do you think I'll ever be happy?

359
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,440
In Young and I?

360
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,580
Of course.

361
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,670
Excuse me.

362
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,120
In Hye must be feeling
weak-hearted.

363
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,630
The children get anxious
when their surgery dates approach.

364
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,860
If it's normal, that's fine.
But, I see such a sudden change in her.

365
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,650
I'll try to coax her.

366
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,260
Don't worry so much.

367
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,800
Dr. Han.

368
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,190
Yes?

369
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,560
Are you sleeping well?

370
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,820
Yes.

371
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,180
I'm sleeping well.

372
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,390
I see.

373
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,600
Then...

374
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,830
<i>Then why didn't you tell him that you're not
going to see him when you were on the phone?</i>

375
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,110
You should make it clear
that you don't like him.

376
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,230
That kid...
Yelling at me for nothing...

377
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,040
You...

378
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,400
You're really not upset?

379
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,870
Are you sure?

380
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,950
I haven't been around, right?

381
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,480
In Hye, you should stay in bed.

382
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,230
I should get some exercise now.

383
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,300
- Okay.
- It's hard for you to bear it now, right?

384
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,370
It's written on your forehead.
'I'm having such a hard time. '

385
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,120
No.

386
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,340
It's okay.

387
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,710
One-sided love is truly a hard thing.

388
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,230
That's true.

389
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,930
It's hard.

390
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,110
It's very hard.

391
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,160
<i>Of course, I was wrong to do that.</i>

392
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,080
But, I wanted to keep you around.

393
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,560
I thought you would make a
great surgeon.

394
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,100
You came to sleep?

395
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,660
No, I came to get my book.

396
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,060
You are lying to me now?

397
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,030
No, it's true.

398
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,210
Stop lying, and go to sleep.

399
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,880
Instead of nodding off in the morning.

400
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,530
- Producer Kim, did you decide on the piece?
- Yes.

401
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,860
Peter Pan.

402
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,770
Why?

403
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,460
If we do that,
we'll have to get dressed up funny.

404
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,070
It's still better than
last year's Cinderella.

405
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,440
Remember when Dr. Cha sprained her ankle
wearing that glass slipper?

406
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:15,820
I heard you were so embarrassed that you
got acupuncture instead of getting treated here.

407
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,110
Who said that?

408
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,370
Professor Kim.

409
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,500
He's got such a big mouth.

410
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,640
Dr. Park, you have to participate, too.

411
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,200
I can do a good job.

412
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,850
At the orphanage Christmas shows,
I was always the main character.

413
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,220
Dr. Park, you must be some actor...

414
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,150
First, I'll put the casting on the
bulletin board.

415
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,980
Hey!
Do it right, so there are no fights.

416
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,250
Okay.

417
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,680
Professor Kim won't participate
again this year?

418
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,470
Should we push him?

419
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,800
I won't do it!

420
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,790
Don't even think about it.

421
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,090
He's so sharp.

422
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,380
He'll do it.

423
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,180
- Pumpkin.
- Pirate!

424
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,230
Tell him to do something like that.

425
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,800
Dr. Park.

426
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Joon Young, I have a request.

427
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
What is it?

428
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,160
Whoever comes to acquire the hospital, we
should side with them if will improve the hospital.

429
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,740
A for-profit hospital is an improvement?

430
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,630
Before it becomes for-profit, if we introduce
the charge-per-diagnosis system

431
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,080
the situation will worsen.

432
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,720
When the quality of service falls,
and private insurances gain power...

433
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,930
the hospital will naturally
become for-profit.

434
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,770
I agree with Chief Kim.

435
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,220
Without having to go the round-about way,
it may be better to take this route.

436
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,240
It'll provide a better environment.

437
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,660
How many times do I have to tell you
that the environment is not everything?

438
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,510
We are talking about forming a
for-profit children's hospital.

439
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:02,080
Does it make sense to discriminate
patients based on their income level?

440
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,770
Are you a doctor,
or a consumer representative?

441
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,070
Now, now...

442
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,100
We are getting off the topic of the
agenda for today.

443
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,650
The agenda for today is regarding the action
we will take as a collective group of doctors.

444
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,200
We need to communicate our decision
to the investors, and protest...

445
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,180
This is not something we can solve
by protesting.

446
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,730
But we should be adamant about our stand.

447
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,010
How can we do that when we
can't agree on anything?

448
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,740
Professor Kim!

449
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,010
Is there anything I can help you with?

450
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,730
I would have helped you out in there
if I knew something...

451
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,240
I'm afraid the only way I can help you
is to add to your head count.

452
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,920
It'll be helpful if you can
side with my position.

453
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,210
Of course, I'll do that.

454
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,490
The one leading the pack is always the one
going through the most trouble...

455
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,980
But, not everyone can
lead the pack...

456
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,100
If the wrong person becomes the leader,
it becomes a mess.

457
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,510
Thank you.

458
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,670
Look at that...

459
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,670
I knew it...

460
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,770
That damn kid...

461
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,090
Hello.

462
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,630
Dr. Park.

463
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,750
Yes?

464
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,750
Do you still think that I'm a bad guy?

465
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,190
Just like a half fried-half spiced chicken,
I feel that way about you.

466
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:02,350
I guess the bad half is because
of the work I do...

467
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,620
What's the good half about?

468
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,860
For believing in Professor Kim
and our team.

469
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,760
I'm most grateful to people
who believe in me.

470
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,100
If you believe in me,
I feel strengthened and full.

471
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
Full?

472
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,570
Yes, having faith is like the pump
used to put air in a bicycle tire.

473
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,510
If you fill up the tire with air,
you can speed along with force.

474
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,760
About In Hye's surgery...

475
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,020
Can you talk to Chief Kim again?

476
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,670
Do you remember that mess we went through
with Chief Kim regarding Dong Soo?

477
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,730
Of course. You even had to go to
the disciplinary committee.

478
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:58,150
Then, are you afraid that
there may be a problem again?

479
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,290
No.

480
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,610
I'm waiting until we have a just cause.

481
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,770
Excuse me?

482
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,820
There was a rumor back then.

483
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,220
Regarding the preemie with
necrotizing enteritis...

484
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,400
People say that you returned him because
you lacked the confidence to operate on him.

485
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,450
And...

486
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,720
they are saying that you didn't want to get
blamed if anything went wrong with the surgery.

487
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,070
That helped me to make
a firm decision to have the surgery.

488
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,380
Not because my pride was hurt,
but because I had a just cause.

489
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,030
A just cause to be responsible
for that patient.

490
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,540
You were planning to do it all along.

491
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,990
But a just cause must be backed up by
a strong basis and an alternative plan.

492
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,470
We had definite medical basis.

493
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,630
And Park Shi On had suggested
a good alternative.

494
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,860
That's why...

495
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:54,370
I'm working on finding a
just cause to operate on In Hye.

496
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,950
It won't take long.

497
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,940
Professor Kim, you are the best!

498
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,210
You better not put that up.

499
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,880
Why are you all acting so childish?

500
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,120
You heartless kid...

501
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,580
- You don't even show your face?
- You told me not to come over to your house.

502
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,440
You still should have visited!

503
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,050
Do you know how much your sister
grilled me?

504
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,290
- That's not my concern...
- What?

505
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,950
I'm giving you one last chance.

506
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,890
Get rid of everyone that's in our way.

507
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,000
Why...

508
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,910
- Why should I do that?
- Just do it!

509
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,060
If things work out, you won't
just become the director of a branch...

510
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,890
you may become the director
of this hospital.

511
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,500
So, do it right.

512
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,600
Don't make any mistakes!

513
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:31,310
<i>I don't have any other wishes.</i>

514
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,930
<i>You don't need to apologize to me.</i>

515
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,260
<i>Just don't hit mom.</i>

516
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,790
<i>If you do that,
I'll be grateful to you.</i>

517
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,840
Did you eat lunch?

518
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,970
Shi On.

519
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,430
I didn't eat yet.
I was going to eat after I was done.

520
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,470
I didn't eat, either.

521
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,110
Really?
Then, let's sit.

522
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,140
No.

523
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,530
Let's go out,
and eat together.

524
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,150
Why did you bring me out to eat?

525
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,210
Today...

526
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,800
Today is my payday.

527
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,960
You worked so hard to earn that money.
You shouldn't spend it like this.

528
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,300
Hurry, and eat.

529
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,970
Okay.
Thank you.

530
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,320
You don't need to make me
the potato soup.

531
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,180
Anytime you want to eat something good,
let me know.

532
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,560
There's one thing I want to ask you.

533
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:43,630
After you left home,
why didn't you come back to get me?

534
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,730
I want to know the real reason.

535
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,840
<i>I wanted to go back
to find you.</i>

536
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,470
<i>But I heard a rumor that
your brother was looking for me.</i>

537
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:14,910
<i>If I came before you and the director,
I thought something bad might happen.</i>

538
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,030
<i>I'm shameful...</i>

539
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:28,110
<i>But I had no choice but to believe that
the director would take good care of you.</i>

540
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>I'm sorry, Shi On.</i>

541
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,420
From the beginning, I knew there was
something wrong with the way he talked.

542
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,600
How can you put someone like that
in charge of my child?

543
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,990
Dr. Park Shi On is a great resident.
You don't need to worry.

544
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,500
Would you put your child in
the hands of a handicapped doctor?

545
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,080
How can you say that?

546
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,340
Dr. Park Shi On is in charge
of my child, too.

547
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,360
Mine, too.

548
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,030
Dr. Park has no problems.

549
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,820
He's so good to the children,
and does a great job treating them.

550
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,250
Mind your own business.
I don't want him.

551
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,870
We'll change the doctor for you.

552
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,790
You can change your child's doctor
if you wish.

553
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,460
Dr. Cha, please do as she wishes.

554
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,390
Are you okay?

555
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,310
I'm really okay.

556
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,400
The ones who know me well
trust me.

557
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,860
But it's possible for people
who don't know me to react that way.

558
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,750
I can totally understand.

559
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,660
It doesn't hurt me anymore that
I'm different from other people.

560
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,030
If I do a good job,
people come to trust me, too.

561
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,420
That's what I'm saying.

562
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,730
But, there's one thing
that hurts me.

563
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,750
About being different...

564
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,920
Never mind.

565
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,770
It's nothing.

566
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,590
I think he's fine.

567
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,770
But, I'm a bit worried that
he might have gotten hurt.

568
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,410
I think he'll be fine.

569
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,790
Park Shi On is free from his
handicap now.

570
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,500
He's got a good sense of
who he is.

571
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,460
More importantly...

572
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:22,540
Park Shi On's genius ability...
It's not the absolute anymore.

573
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,570
What do you mean?

574
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,860
I trained him to develop that ability.

575
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,560
That was the only way
for him to survive.

576
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,120
But, I don't think
that's true anymore.

577
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,900
Before, all he had was his
genius ability.

578
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,660
But now, he's got much more than that.

579
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:47,940
So even if he loses that ability,
he'll still be a great doctor.

580
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,140
Even if he lacks a little bit.

581
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,700
Like what you said before...

582
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,190
I guess this is the second option
you mentioned.

583
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,990
Second option?

584
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,290
First option, a superior doctor
with no common sense.

585
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,070
Second option...

586
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,870
An average doctor
who can reason well.

587
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,400
The second option here.

588
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,410
That was a good sleep.

589
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,420
I...

590
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,620
I'm really not here to sleep.

591
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,040
Fine.

592
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,770
I'm craving something spicy...

593
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:52,700
- Hey!
- Yes?

594
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,770
Go home, and bring back some
spicy beef stew.

595
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,650
Right now?

596
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,810
Yes.

597
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,230
That was pretty good.

598
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,290
Okay.

599
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,700
I'll be right back.

600
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,040
Let's sleep some more.

601
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,240
<i>It doesn't hurt me anymore that
I'm different from other people.</i>

602
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,070
But, there's just one thing
that hurts me.

603
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:15,060
About being different...

604
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,480
Before...

605
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,120
I didn't get to tell you.
I'm sorry.

606
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,140
The one thing that hurts me
about being different from others.

607
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,650
It's because of you.

608
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:08,010
I'm really okay now
being different from others.

609
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,920
It doesn't hurt me anymore.

610
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:12,860
But...

611
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,020
Whenever I see you,
it hurts me.

612
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:30,650
If I was a really cool guy,
I would be able to make you happier.

613
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,050
I would be able to do
more things for you.

614
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,740
I would sing you a lot of
great songs.

615
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,200
While we are on the topic...

616
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,220
It's a bit embarrassing,
but let me sing you a song.

617
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,940
I'm not good.

618
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,680
But, it's a song that
I really want to sing for you.

619
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:08,900
<i>If I were the sky...</i>

620
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:15,210
<i>I would want to
remain on your face...</i>

621
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:25,010
<i>Like the reddening sky
of the sunset...</i>

622
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:30,160
<i>I would want to
paint your cheeks...</i>

623
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:45,760
<i>Whatever it may be...
I want to become for you.</i>

624
00:50:47,260 --> 00:51:00,670
<i>If we are together like this,
it's the greatest happiness to me.</i>

625
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,090
<i>My love...</i>

626
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,700
<i>Do you know?</i>

627
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:16,100
<i>About my feelings for you?</i>

628
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,880
Let's go!

629
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,400
It'll be so good.

630
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,170
- I just have an average role.
- Why am I #2 again?

631
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,440
- Pirate #2?
- Hey, don't complain.

632
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,400
The producer has every right to
cast as she wants.

633
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,850
Park Shi On!

634
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:16,320
I'll do a good job.
I'll put my soul into it.

635
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,070
But, who's going to play the part
of Captain Hook?

636
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,450
Just wait.

637
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,670
Right, Dr. Park?

638
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,960
Who is it?

639
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,170
Who?

640
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,700
Our hidden card.

641
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,800
Joon Young...

642
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,260
It's my wish.

643
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,260
I want to see you in the skit.

644
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,840
I think that would make me
really happy.

645
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,800
I think I'll be able to heal sooner.

646
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,300
Can I do something else for you?

647
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,000
Forget it.

648
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,540
I won't watch the skit.

649
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,240
I'll just take the medicine, and sleep.

650
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,960
Peter Pan!

651
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,750
The pirate is coming!

652
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,790
He must have a big crew.
What do we do?

653
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,830
Don't worry.

654
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,960
I'll take care of him
once and for all!

655
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,420
Captain!
This is Peter Pan!

656
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,550
I see.
Peter Pan, this kid.

657
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,010
Pull out the sword.

658
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,480
Professor Kim!

659
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,670
Why are you reading the parenthesis?
Don't you know anything?

660
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,180
I know.

661
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,750
I was just trying to make it perfect
for our practice.

662
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,040
I hate to say this,
but you are a bit like a hole.

663
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,880
A hole at least two meters wide.

664
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,680
Were you all good from the start?

665
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,590
Even if it's for kids...
You call this a script?

666
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,570
There's nothing wrong with the script.

667
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,580
It's fine.

668
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,480
Never mind.

669
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,250
Let's start from the beginning.

670
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,900
Fine, get on the boat.

671
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,000
Again!

672
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,150
Let's try again.

673
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,780
Cue!

674
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,620
Help!
Captain Hook's coming!

675
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,010
He must have a big crew.
What do we do?

676
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,250
Don't worry.

677
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,500
I'll take care of him
once and for all!

678
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,050
Captain!
This is Peter Pan!

679
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,880
I see.
Peter Pan, this kid.

680
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,910
Michael, take care of the rest.

681
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,720
What's wrong with me?

682
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:39,810
In Hye,
why are you out here?

683
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,090
My back hurts from
laying down too much.

684
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,910
Then stay here for a while,
and go back in.

685
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,470
Dr. Cha!

686
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,440
Come and have a seat.

687
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:58,750
What is it?

688
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,680
Dr. Park is hurting a lot.

689
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,970
More than the kids who are sick here.

690
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,280
I'm better now.

691
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:22,200
But, I'm still not good with
expressing my emotions.

692
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,750
But these days,
I think that it's a good thing.

693
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,430
Dr. Cha won't see.

694
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,350
But sometimes...

695
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,880
I wish I could show her my heart.

696
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:46,700
But when I get the chance,
I can't do that.

697
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,730
You see...

698
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,750
I wish there was a neon sign
on my chest.

699
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:03,650
He said he wishes you could see it
loud and clear.

700
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,030
What a fool.

701
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,700
You didn't go home, yet?

702
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm going now.

703
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,440
It's getting late.
You should hurry home.

704
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,460
It's late.
You don't want to walk me?

705
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,280
I'll walk you out to the door.

706
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,640
No, walk me all the way home.

707
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,900
What?

708
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:05,750
Okay.

709
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,870
Is something wrong?

710
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:15,850
Yes.

711
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:19,020
May I ask what it is?

712
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,610
Some foolish kid
is making me feel so frustrated.

713
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:27,410
Who dares to make you
feel that way?

714
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,640
I know...

715
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,910
There's just this kid.

716
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,690
That's not good.

717
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,830
I want you to feel good at all times.

718
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,740
But, I don't feel good.

719
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,250
What?

720
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,040
Shi On.

721
00:58:54,620 --> 00:59:01,710
Why do you always pretend to be okay,
when I know you are hurting?

722
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:13,240
Am I the one who is making you
feel frustrated?

723
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,100
Who else is next to me?

724
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:22,700
I told you before...

725
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,930
I was trying not to make you
feel uncomfortable.

726
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,680
Stop thinking about putting a neon sign
on your chest.

727
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,570
Just tell me honestly.

728
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,490
Then, you will...

729
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:48,670
What?

730
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,740
You're afraid I won't see you then?

731
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,220
No.

732
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,600
I'll continue to see you.

733
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,290
As much as you...

734
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:11,750
Because I want to see you, too.

735
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:24,600
You don't know who makes me
both smile and cry these days, right?

736
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:34,270
You don't know who makes my heart
ache these days, right?

737
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,630
Of course, not.

738
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,330
I think it's because of me.

739
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,480
Since the beginning,
I was lacking in a lot of things.

740
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,150
But, you took good care of me
like a little brother.

741
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,870
I think I made you worry about me
too much.

742
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,300
It's not because I think of you
as a younger brother.

743
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,070
Then, what is it?

744
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,260
These days...

745
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,060
I've become quite strange.

746
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:22,370
Well, not strange...

747
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,610
Something like that...

748
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,550
I mean...

749
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,120
It bothers me when you are
close to other women.

750
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:44,370
And it bothers me when you ask me
to set you up on a blind date.

751
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,430
That's how I feel.

752
01:01:51,760 --> 01:02:00,660
Now, I don't want you to
lean on me anymore.

753
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,440
Now...

754
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,210
I...

755
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,880
I want to...

756
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:46,780
