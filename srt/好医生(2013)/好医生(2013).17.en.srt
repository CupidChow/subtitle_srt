2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,580
In Hye!

3
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,880
Wake up!

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,560
We should go to the hospital
to get the injection and disinfected.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,670
Just a bit more..

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,570
Why are you here?

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,570
I came to pick up In Hye.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,260
I would have brought her myself.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,110
Look at you...

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,510
You didn't even wash your face?

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,950
Dr. Cha.

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,990
I...

13
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,820
In Hye!

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,380
- In Hye!
- Wake up!

15
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,310
In Hye! In Hye!

16
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,050
39.6 degrees fever.
And BP is low.

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,790
But why the sudden...

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,440
She didn't take her medicine. The
gastric hyperacidity caused the bleeding.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,420
In Hye has another infection?

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,610
Yes, it's acute septicemia.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
- Is it septic shock?
- Yes.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,320
Get the blood test,
and replace her Chemoport.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,680
I made it clear that I don't
want to see you.

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,140
Go.

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,120
Don't concern yourself with the
matters of the foundation. I'll...

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,410
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,410
I mean it.

28
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:10,780
I think this is the first time I'm saying
sorry since middle school.

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,320
What I did...

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,790
I know it's impossible
for me to fix all of it.

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,940
But, please give me the chance
to try and fix it.

32
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,790
Chae Kyung.

33
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,950
There's nothing you can do
for the foundation now.

34
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,230
It's not for the foundation.

35
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,630
I want to do this for my dad
and the director...

36
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,940
And for you.

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,030
It's a good thing that she still has
living blood vessels.

38
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,860
I shouldn't have taken her
home yesterday.

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,780
Even if she was here, this would have
happened. Don't blame yourself.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,920
That's right.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,170
The infection must have started
at least a week or two before.

42
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,970
She didn't have a fever yesterday.

43
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,550
Septic Shock occurs without warning.

44
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,280
Come to my room.

45
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,650
What do you guys do here?

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,440
Park Shi On.

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,010
As her main doctor, you couldn't
even keep her medication schedule?

48
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,270
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,040
Han Jin Wook.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,220
You've known her for the longest.
You should have taken better care of her!

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,570
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,830
Cha Yoon Seo, you should have
returned her to the hospital.

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,500
How could you keep her at your house?

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,520
Who cares if you care about her
like your own niece, you made her sick!

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
Kim Do Han!

56
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,240
You can't take better care
of your patient?

57
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,670
Her surgery date is set.

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,550
How can you bring her back to the
hospital in this worsened state?

59
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,300
What are you going to do if she's
not better by the surgery date?

60
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,300
Do it right.

62
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,110
Unless you want to kill the patient
before she even gets the transplant.

63
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,400
I'm sorry, In Young.

64
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,220
I'm the one at fault.
I'm the doctor in charge of her.

65
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,540
No.

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,870
It's because of me.

67
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,560
She was upset because of me,
and that's why she went out in the cold.

68
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,430
What was your position on the team?

69
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,220
Outfielder.

70
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,900
And I was the fifth hitter.

71
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,950
You were part of the clean up trio.

72
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,830
Just like Lee Byung Gyu, I want
to become a famous baseball player.

73
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,940
I see.

74
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm sure your dreams will come true.

75
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,000
Right...

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
This.

77
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,970
You can have it.

78
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,160
This is the ball that I hit
my first single with.

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,820
Why are you giving something so
special to me?

80
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,040
It's a gift.

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,920
Please take good care of me.

82
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,870
You don't need to.

83
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,830
No, please take it.

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,220
We are planning to go to Japan
next week.

85
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,850
We have an appointment with
Professor Miura Daisuke at Gameda Hospital.

86
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,620
He's one of the top doctors
in this field.

87
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:54,770
I hope you understand that I'm not
trying to damage your pride.

88
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,710
Yes.

89
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,240
We will forward you the files.

90
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,610
Thank you.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,470
Vice President.

92
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,310
It's a fortunate thing.

93
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,890
That the last image I have of you
is the image of a father.

94
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,240
Why don't you wear it?

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,860
You don't like it?

96
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,640
No.

97
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,510
It's too expensive.
I feel burdened.

98
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,220
It's okay.
You can wear it.

99
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,750
No, I can never take it.

100
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,070
I don't think you are giving it back
because it's expensive.

101
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,240
Why?

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,110
Somebody told you not to wear it?

103
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,450
Is someone jealous because
I bought this for you?

104
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,170
The one you confessed your feelings to...
She must be interested in you, too.

105
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,810
If she didn't care about you,
she wouldn't say anything.

106
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,840
Do you really think that's why?

107
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,960
So, you really are returning this
to me because of her.

108
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,150
I was just saying that.

109
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,800
You tricked me.

110
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,990
Manager Yoon...

111
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,630
I'm starting to dislike you
just a tad bit.

112
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,650
So cute...

113
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,090
If you do anything...

114
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,430
you'll die.

115
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,400
Do you understand,
you bastard!

116
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,100
What am I thinking?

117
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,870
Oh my...

118
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,780
Are you thinking about me?

119
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,590
What are you thinking about that
you have a smile on your face?

120
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,390
It's none of your business.

121
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,660
Should I guess?

122
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,030
I'm quite good at this,
you know...

123
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,430
Let's see...

124
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,850
Forget it!

125
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,510
What brings you here?

126
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,490
It's time.

127
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,170
The anniversary of our department!

128
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,210
Right!
It's already that time.

129
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,680
Shouldn't we prepare for
the performance?

130
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,830
You should discuss it with the
medical department.

131
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,280
Tell them no Cinderella this year.
The kids don't even like that.

132
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,080
This year, I'll plan something
really fun.

133
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,060
- You may go.
- Okay.

134
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,530
Is your wound healing okay?

135
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes, it's fine.

136
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,660
Don't overlook treatment because
you are busy.

137
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,910
A doctor needs to be healthy
before he can take care of the patients.

138
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,470
I'll keep that in mind.

139
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,280
But...

140
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,070
Do you think the Foundation
can be built up again?

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,920
Chairwoman Lee and the members
are trying hard...

142
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,850
but I think it will be hard.

143
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,240
The main problem isn't that the
hospital will be sold over.

144
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,730
As time passes, the great doctors in our hospital
may get influenced by the profit-oriented structure.

145
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,820
That's what I'm afraid of.

146
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,280
That's true.

147
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,800
But it will be hard to hold out
based solely on principles.

148
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,470
Yes.
I'm sure it will be hard.

149
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,810
But a set of principles is
like a sheath.

150
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,850
It's not sharp enough to
cut anything.

151
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,100
But, it can cover up that sharpness.

152
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,430
So that no one gets hurt.

153
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,690
Why are you still looking at that?

154
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,250
I wanted to use it as my personal
thesis statement.

155
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,540
The vice president will be taking him
to Professor Miura Daisuke.

156
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,660
What?

157
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,380
Isn't he one of the top authorities
in this field?

158
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,470
Yes.

159
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,430
Put this aside.
And worry about other cases.

160
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,130
Are you okay?

161
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,980
Is the wound infected?

162
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,320
No.

163
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,080
I got chosen.

164
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,290
Shi On.

165
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,420
Shi On.

166
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,780
It's me.

167
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,250
Dong Gu.

168
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,080
Jang Dong Gu.

169
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,290
Dong Gu?

170
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,400
Hey, if you want to come on our side,
there's a condition.

171
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,130
What is it?

172
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,480
If you go in there,
you'll see a ball bearing.

173
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
Go bring that.

174
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,030
Dong Gu.

175
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,080
Jang Dong Gu.

176
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,300
My child suffers from a sacrococcygeal tumor.

177
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,810
He's scheduled for the surgery tomorrow.

178
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,100
I made a mistake my senior year in
high school, and had him.

179
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,220
Still, he's my son.
So I raised him until now.

180
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:19,320
Actually, I saw you the day before yesterday,
but I couldn't say anything to you.

181
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,380
I didn't have the courage.

182
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,670
Even if it was something that happened
when we were kids...

183
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:35,330
I've committed a big sin
against you and your brother.

184
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:45,920
I think my son, Joo Nam, is getting
punished for what I did.

185
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,750
Don't say that to your child.

186
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,500
The child is just sick.
He's not getting punished.

187
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,280
Back then...

188
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,780
I lost the chance to apologize.

189
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,280
I'm sorry.

190
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,560
Please forgive me...

191
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,640
My friend.

192
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,880
Shi On!

193
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,350
Why are you so lethargic?

194
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,210
Oh...

195
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,060
I'll be getting up.

196
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,020
Professor Kim.

197
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,710
What is it?

198
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,990
I have something to ask you.

199
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,240
What is it now?

200
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,610
There's someone that's done
great wrong to me.

201
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,710
If he apologizes to me,
should I forgive him?

202
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,860
It depends on the person.

203
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,100
If he's apologizing to get you
on his side, don't forgive him.

204
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,730
But if he's truly repenting,
then you should forgive him.

205
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,030
I'm not sure what his intentions are.

206
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,040
It's simple.

207
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,850
Look at the kind of life that he's led,
and the life that he's living now.

208
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,210
Dr. Park.

209
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,700
Yes?

210
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,790
Your mind is wandering around
in thin air again!

211
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,750
I got it.

212
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,940
Can you give me an hour of
your time later?

213
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,870
What for?

214
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,070
I have a raffle ticket from a family
restaurant, and I got chosen.

215
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,030
I want to buy you dinner.

216
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,260
Raffle...

217
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,170
I'll see you later.

218
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,130
Kiss!
Kiss!

219
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,680
Kiss!

220
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,220
Let us eat, first.

221
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,030
Then, after you finish eating...

222
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,600
Kiss!
Kiss!

223
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,950
Excuse me!

224
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,800
We'll take care of our business.

225
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,400
Take care of what business?

226
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,630
You'll do it in the dark?

227
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,010
Kiss!
Kiss!

228
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,860
I thought it was just a dinner ticket.

229
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,610
I guess it was an event for a couple.

230
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,970
It's okay.
I'll just eat my steak.

231
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
They want us to kiss when we're
done eating, what are you going to do?

232
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,860
What are you going to do?

233
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,150
We can't.

234
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,460
I don't want to.

235
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,960
I was just kidding, but you're
so serious about your refusal.

236
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,620
It's not that. I heard that you are
only supposed to kiss the one you'll marry.

237
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,540
So, that's why we can't kiss.

238
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,770
Who said that?

239
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,510
Did I hear wrong?

240
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,170
Then when and where can people kiss?

241
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,410
Anywhere...

242
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,640
Whenever you want to.

243
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:47,750
I see...
Whenever you want to...

244
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,780
Why did you bring me here?

245
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,630
You said you want to regain
your good memories.

246
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,950
Yes.

247
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,750
This is where I confessed my
feelings for you.

248
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,350
Oh, right...

249
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,140
Now, I remember.

250
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,260
What exactly did you say then?

251
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,650
I think it was something really sweet.

252
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,350
It wasn't sweet at all.

253
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,480
What I said was...

254
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,470
'Thinking about it, I'm sick of being alone.'

255
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,840
That's it?

256
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,030
Yes.

257
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,370
Really?
That was it?

258
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,530
Yes.

259
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,140
What's that?

260
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,000
Why do I remember it as
something sweet?

261
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,730
I guess I was sweeter than
the confession.

262
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,480
You're right.

263
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,730
When you are blinded by love,
what wouldn't seem sweet?

264
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,470
Seeing it like that...
A good memory...

265
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,040
I don't think it's something you can
recall by talking about it.

266
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,860
I guess not.

267
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,890
A woman with a
body temperature of 36.7 degrees.

268
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,920
And unusually thin humerus
and ulna bones...

269
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,990
I just remember that she was
sitting next to me.

270
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,190
Do you talk to Jin Wook about
relationships and dating?

271
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,150
Yes, sometimes.

272
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,530
Did you tell him that you
have feelings for me?

273
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,930
No, I didn't.

274
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,920
Because you were embarrassed?

275
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,050
Not because I'm embarrassed.
I just didn't want to say it.

276
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,990
Why not?

277
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,860
Didn't you want to tell someone?

278
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,040
Actually, I did.

279
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:28,750
But, if I tell others about
liking someone...

280
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,950
I may be harming that person.

281
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,720
How?

282
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,220
Because I'm different from
other people.

283
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,810
The person I like will
get teased by other people.

284
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,780
My friends got teased, too.

285
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,310
Because they were close to me.

286
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:59,370
That's why it was better for me
to be alone.

287
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,610
It was better for me to
get teased alone.

288
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,140
You should get some sleep.

289
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,520
No...
I'm fine.

290
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,370
She still has a fever.

291
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,160
But you know how it is...

292
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,120
It takes a while to recuperate
from septicemia.

293
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,280
If you wait a few days,
she'll get better.

294
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,090
Don't worry so much.

295
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,730
Doctor Han.

296
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,880
Yes?

297
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,990
You should get some good rest, too.

298
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,430
Don't lose sleep.

299
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,730
Excuse me?

300
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:04,370
After I go through the surgery,
I won't be able to live as an average woman.

301
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,860
Whoever I date...

302
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,590
I'll become a burden to that person
for the rest of my life.

303
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,490
It's my request.

304
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,940
Please stop having any more
feelings for me.

305
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,940
It's really hard for me.

306
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,210
Is In Hye a burden to you?

307
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,140
It's the same for me.

308
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,340
No matter how much I think about it...

309
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,700
I don't think you could ever
become a burden to me.

310
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,580
Park Shi On!

311
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,820
It was you, right?
It could only have been you.

312
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,740
You told In Young, right?

313
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,950
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,050
I didn't mean to tell her anything.

315
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,900
Still, I'm grateful.

316
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,150
For telling her for me.

317
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,240
How did In Young react?

318
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,340
How do you think she reacted?

319
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,920
You don't look happy.

320
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,150
It seems that way?

321
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,950
What can I do?

322
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,370
It's still love even if it hurts.

323
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,310
It's still love even if it hurts?

324
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,760
Because I'm different from
other people.

325
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,990
The person I like will get teased
by others.

326
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,210
<i>Back then...</i>

327
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,100
<i>I lost the chance to apologize.</i>

328
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,720
<i>I'm sorry.
Please forgive me...</i>

329
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,830
My friend.

330
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,970
Are you awake now?

331
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,020
I thought I died.

332
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,180
Why would you die?

333
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,770
I'm sorry, Dr. Park.
For putting you through this.

334
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,770
It's okay.

335
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,010
Please tell Dr. Cha I'm sorry, too.

336
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,020
Okay. I will.

337
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,530
From now on, you have to take your medicine
and get all the treatments.

338
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,400
Don't cry.

339
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,830
Okay.

340
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,220
I won't cry anymore.

341
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,730
And I...

342
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,880
I don't want to die.

343
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,350
I know.

344
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,920
We'll have the surgery in an hour.

345
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,470
Okay.
Please take care of him.

346
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,390
Yes, please take care of him.

347
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,100
He's a friend from back home.

348
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,710
And Joo Nam is my friend's son.

349
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,310
Please take care of him, Professor Kim.

350
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,990
You two were friends?

351
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,210
You should have told me earlier.

352
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,870
Thank you, Shi On.

353
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,170
You don't need to thank me.

354
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,100
Of course, the surgery needs
to be successful.

355
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,530
You must love Joo Nam a lot.

356
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,750
Of course.

357
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,910
He's my son.

358
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,850
It's hard to raise him,
but he's my only hope.

359
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,470
Then, let me ask you one thing.

360
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,490
Am I...

361
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,180
Am I your friend?

362
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,610
Of course.

363
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,270
You're my friend.

364
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,890
Back then, I was a bad friend.

365
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,180
Now, a grateful friend.

366
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,420
Then...

367
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,620
I'll forgive you.

368
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,170
But, there's a condition.

369
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,620
What is it?

370
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,050
Joo Nam.

371
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,190
Raise him healthy and well.

372
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,870
Strong and healthy like you.

373
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,740
I'll do that.

374
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:03,000
Again, the most important thing is to remove
the tumor here pressing down on the nerve.

375
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,450
Because the tumor is pressing down on the
nerve, we'll have to go in more carefully.

376
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,500
That's right.

377
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,420
If we take care of this,
the rest is easy.

378
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,220
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

379
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,480
Let's get up.

380
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,780
Yes.

381
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,800
Okay.

382
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,520
There's a patient in ER
with a suspected hernia.

383
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,550
Hurry, and go.

384
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,630
What about the surgery?

385
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,170
You don't have to come in.
Go, and take care of the patient.

386
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,190
Yes, sir.

387
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,580
He's had stomach and chest pains
for the past four hours.

388
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,800
Four hours?

389
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,160
He collapsed in gym class, and stayed
in the nurse's office for a long time.

390
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,380
And he was in traffic for an hour
on the way here.

391
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,450
Doctor...

392
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,710
What's wrong with my child?

393
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,360
We need to run some tests.
The child is not in good condition.

394
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,220
- We'll take the CT scan.
- Okay.

395
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,940
Dr. Park, get the CT scan.

396
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,810
Diaphragmatic hernia?

397
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,540
This is huge...

398
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,830
It was discovered by chance because of the
symptoms of an absent thoracic diaphragm.

399
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,830
The intestines have pushed up to the chest,
and are pressing on the lungs.

400
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,800
The intestines were stuck in the diaphragm,
and have been necrotized.

401
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,100
He needs urgent surgery.
Quickly, quickly.

402
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,710
It's too late. If we open him up now,
he'll go into arrest.

403
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,790
Yes, I understand.

404
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,100
The situation is very bad.
The manager hasn't decided on surgery, yet.

405
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,720
Seriously...

406
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,180
- How severe is the necrosis?
- He arrived late, so it's progressed a lot.

407
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,320
I'll go.

408
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,690
Will you be okay?

409
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,350
Whatever happens,
we need to open him up.

410
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,100
He came too late.
It's too late.

411
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,150
- It's over if we open him up.
- Manager...

412
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,300
Shut up!

413
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,550
This is insane...

414
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,720
We are losing time.

415
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,190
I know!

416
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,980
Dr. Park, arrange the operating room.
And get an anesthesiologist.

417
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,810
What are you doing?

418
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,820
Okay.

419
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,270
- Where's the patient with the ruptured diaphragm?
- He's in the operating room.

420
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,190
- Who's performing the surgery?
- Manager Ko will do it.

421
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,200
Really?

422
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,730
The manager is performing the surgery.

423
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,660
You do it.
First assistant.

424
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,020
Excuse me?

425
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,170
You and I are the only ones from
pediatric surgery. You have to do it!

426
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,790
Yes, sir.

427
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,010
Anesthesia is done.

428
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,710
Scalpel.

429
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,000
Gauze.

430
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:34,850
Suction.

431
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,580
- Arrest! Arrest!
- The vitals are dropping!

432
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,260
The vitals can't be sustained.

433
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,210
First, we'll pull out the intestines
stuck in the diaphragm.

434
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,170
Then, we'll remove the
necrotized part.

435
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,850
This has to be the way.

436
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,100
BP is dropping!

437
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,000
It's not coming out.

438
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,400
Manager Ko.
Retractor.

439
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,670
I got it!

440
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:51,120
The vitals aren't returning.
It's V-Tach.

441
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,380
We'll get the necrotized part later.
Get the defibrillator.

442
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,310
50 Joules.

443
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,860
Clear!

444
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,280
Shock!

445
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,900
The rhythm's not changing.

446
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,920
100 joules.

447
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,340
Clear. Shock!

448
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,940
Manager Ko.

449
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,970
Manager Ko!

450
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,680
Heart.

451
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,850
Heart Massage...

452
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,640
Come on...

453
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,660
Come on...

454
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,650
The pulse is returning.

455
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,340
The vitals are coming back.

456
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,130
Now, you can take out the
necrotized area.

457
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,370
Yes.

458
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Scissors.

459
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,960
Tie.

460
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,070
Scissors.

461
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,330
Okay.

462
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,060
You take care of the rest.

463
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,370
Yes, sir.

464
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,150
Good job.

465
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,340
You worked hard.

466
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,510
It was nothing.

467
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,450
I thought you would transfer him again.

468
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,260
Why, so he can die on the way?

469
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,860
You should get some rest.

470
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,410
Professor Kim.

471
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,360
Yes?

472
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,650
Thank you.

473
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,300
Not at all.

474
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,930
Why are you running around?

475
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,750
- You are the best!
- You scared me!

476
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,560
I knew you were deserving
of my respect.

477
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,970
Are you teasing me now?

478
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,180
It's the big size, and you
took out the jalapenos, right?

479
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,830
Thank you.

480
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,530
It's your treat?

481
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,750
It's pay-day! It's only
right that I should treat you guys.

482
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,640
Setting a good example...

483
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,770
Thank you.

484
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,020
Enjoy.

485
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,500
Why isn't Dr. Park coming?

486
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,640
He's helping the manager
with files.

487
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,530
But, isn't the manager acting strange?

488
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,720
Right?

489
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,250
He even performed the surgery today.

490
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,700
I've noticed that he's often
in the file room and the laboratory.

491
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,260
What's going on?

492
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,920
This is very strange...

493
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,170
I know.

494
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,420
Did he exchange his soul
with someone else?

495
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,260
These days, I think he's been
going over Park Shi On's house.

496
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,020
Why would he do that?

497
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,190
I don't know.

498
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,910
Park Shi On was telling him to come over
to eat some spicy beef stew.

499
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,620
How on Earth do they get along?

500
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,460
What an odd couple.

501
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,970
It's all done.

502
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,220
Nothing's wrong.

503
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,270
Do you like baseball?

504
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,190
No, I don't know baseball well.
I don't even know the rules.

505
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,410
There's something I do know.

506
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,880
If you strike out three times,
the hitter changes.

507
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,220
And homerun.

508
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,970
Baseball is fun.

509
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,960
You should learn it.

510
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,010
Then, will you teach it to me?

511
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,350
Of course, come whenever
you have time.

512
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,820
- Then, I'm really going to go everyday.
- That would be great.

513
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,050
That I have something to teach
to a smart doctor.

514
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,860
You should get her hospitalized, first.
We'll tell you the surgery date after.

515
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,800
Please take care of her.

516
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,210
Don't worry.

517
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,060
If you go outside, the nurse
will give you more detailed information.

518
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,220
Thank you.

519
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,880
Good bye, Yae Rin.

520
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,640
- Was that the last patient?
- Yes.

521
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,380
Manager Ko.

522
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,510
Yes?

523
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,270
Well...

524
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,140
Let's see.

525
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,500
This is not your fault.

526
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,590
Stop frowning so much.

527
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,140
I feel sorry to you.

528
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,220
It's not your fault.

529
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,190
If you keep doing that,
I'm going to get mad.

530
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,210
Dr. Cha.

531
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,230
Yes?

532
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,220
You don't know how much Dr. Park
loves you, right?

533
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:10,430
If love is small, it's easy to see.

534
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,760
But when it's very big,
it's hard to see.

535
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,650
That's why I couldn't see
In Young's love for me.

536
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,110
The funny thing is...

537
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,040
I realized it the moment I collapsed.

538
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,850
I don't know why.

539
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,780
When I woke up,
I really wanted to live.

540
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,780
For my sister.

541
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,650
Anyway...

542
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,890
I thought you may be similar to me.

543
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,490
Not being able to see...

544
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,680
There's been something
I wanted to ask you for a while.

545
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,030
What is it?

546
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,630
Hurry, and say it!

547
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,190
I want to drink.

548
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,420
A long time ago,
when I almost failed.

549
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,490
Yes.

550
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,120
Why did you give me a good grade?

551
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,790
Tell me.

552
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:43,840
Did my mother give you money?

553
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,070
What?
What do you take me for?

554
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,790
You really want to know why
I didn't fail you?

555
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,980
Yes.

556
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,890
I felt like I was looking at myself.

557
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:11,370
I really wanted to become a surgeon,
but I was surrounded by geniuses.

558
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:16,380
I tried my hardest, but I couldn't keep up.
I kept lagging behind.

559
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,090
I barely hung on until the end.

560
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,280
You were exactly like me.

561
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,810
I know I was wrong to do that.

562
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:32,880
But...

563
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,500
I really wanted to keep you around.

564
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,250
I thought you would become
a great doctor.

565
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,210
Nobody did that for me.

566
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:19,010
Dr. Han, I'm going to go home,
and get some rest for a little bit.

567
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,910
You should just come in
tomorrow morning.

568
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,780
You haven't been able to sleep
for three days.

569
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,950
I'm okay.

570
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,450
If you aren't thinking clearly,
you'll make mistakes. Sleep comfortably.

571
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,660
Thank you.

572
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,940
Okay.

573
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,670
What's this?

574
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,090
What did you do to me?

575
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,540
I didn't do anything!

576
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,530
You both had food stains all over your
clothes, so I washed them.

577
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,370
Why am I here again?

578
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,070
I found you passed out at the
outdoor bar.

579
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:34,920
Spicy beef stew is ready.
Come quickly.

580
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,490
When I opened it, I found out
that there was almost no bracken.

581
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,640
So, I bought some.

582
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,180
Eat a lot.

583
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,110
Let's eat, first.

584
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,940
You should eat, too.

585
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:06,840
Okay.

586
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,330
Your clothes aren't dry, yet.
You can wear my clothes.

587
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,950
Players, ready!

588
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,580
Go!

589
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:35,760
Player Lee Woo Ram is in the lead.

590
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,840
The other players aren't running.

591
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,850
The winner is Player Lee Woo Ram!

592
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,410
You must be tired,
you should have left him in the room.

593
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,840
He wanted to play with the other kids.

594
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,340
He's ahead again...

595
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,190
He's so different from when
we were in the U.S.

596
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,340
He likes the doctors,
and he's lively.

597
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,050
He seems just as happy as
when he's playing baseball.

598
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,200
Why did you set a date
without asking me?

599
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,950
Why do I have to go there
for Aunt?

600
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,940
How insane...

601
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,240
I'm just going to sit there
for an hour.

602
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,900
Don't say anything.

603
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,550
You're going home early.

604
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:13,040
Yes, I have a school reunion.

605
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,320
Have a good time.

606
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,470
Okay.

607
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,960
School reunion?

608
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,990
Your hobby...

609
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,610
I work hard at the hospital.

610
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,910
Then, you can't even dream
about playing golf?

611
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,450
No, I can't play golf.

612
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,610
Your hometown...

613
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,890
Seoul.

614
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:01,200
Talk about Voldemort...

615
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,600
Shi On.

616
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,200
Wow!
You are so pretty.

617
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,670
You look like the anchorwoman
on the 9 o'clock news.

618
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,320
'Next news...'

619
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,890
But, why did you come here
instead of going home?

620
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,370
I just felt like it!

621
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:05,390
I had an arranged date with
Prosecutor Voldemort.

622
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,720
I see.

623
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,630
My mother made me...

624
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,000
So, I just went out.

625
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,610
You're not upset?

626
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,190
About what?

627
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,830
I lied before that I had
a school reunion.

628
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,350
Oh, that...

629
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,500
I'm okay.

630
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:39,270
Why are you always okay?

631
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,550
You're making me into a funny person.

632
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,320
But, this is the first time.

633
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,390
I've never seen you dressed up
so pretty like this before.

634
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,580
Really?

635
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:57,310
Yes.

636
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,690
You...

637
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,800
You really aren't upset?

638
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,150
You're sure?

639
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,070
Yes.

640
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:12,730
Fine.

641
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,990
I'm going home.

642
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,170
Dad.

643
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,200
I like this hospital so much.

644
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,590
Strangely, after coming here,
I'm not hurting as much.

645
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,360
Almost as if I wasn't sick at all.

646
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,590
Really?

647
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,760
Yes.

648
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,080
Do you remember when I changed teams
to the one at Sung Tang School?

649
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,160
Of course, I remember.

650
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,600
I went there because we heard there's
a really famous coach there.

651
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,120
But, I didn't play as well there.

652
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,970
So, I went back to our school team.

653
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:47,630
Right, that's what happened.

654
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,310
Our school coach was much better.

655
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,930
He made me feel comfortable.

656
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,810
So, I was able to hit a lot of homeruns.

657
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,080
That's exactly how I feel now.

658
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,570
When I went to a big hospital in the U.S...

659
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:10,450
I was hurting more there.
My body...

660
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,600
and my heart...

661
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,430
You did?

662
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,680
Our Joon Young...

663
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,520
Please operate on him.

664
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,520
I hope you will be successful.

665
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,140
May I ask why you changed your mind?

666
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,060
My child wants to have the surgery here.

667
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:35,390
But, that's not the only reason.

668
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,050
I...

669
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:47,010
I wanted somebody to fulfill my dream.

670
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,800
But...

671
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,970
I'm the only one who can
choose my own dream.

672
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,170
Nobody else can do it.

673
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:02,880
My uncertainties as a father made me give
up on my right to choose my own dream.

674
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,400
I realized that.

675
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:12,050
And that's what made me
change my mind.

676
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,120
I understand well what you're saying.

677
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:23,870
But, I want to make one thing certain.

678
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:27,660
This has nothing to do with
the selling of the hospital.

679
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,080
- Don't...
- I feel the same way.

680
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,820
I'm talking to you as a
patient's guardian.

681
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:38,460
I won't connect this to anything else.

682
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,350
Thank you.

683
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,190
When his father is about to die...

684
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,090
Why isn't Shi On even
showing his face?

685
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,660
He's busy.

686
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,940
He's got a lot of patients
to take care of.

687
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,690
How can they trust in that stupid kid?

688
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,240
Stop saying that he's stupid.

689
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,710
Do you think just anyone can
become a doctor here?

690
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,350
You don't think I know?

691
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,730
He's here only because of the director.

692
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,850
Don't say that.

693
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,950
It's hard to stay here without any talents.

694
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,040
Shut up.

695
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,610
I...

696
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:29,260
I'm going to go for a walk.

697
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,290
Get me up.

698
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:36,130
Just stay still.
The doctor told you to get rest.

699
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,890
Stop blabbing on.
I said to get me up.

700
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,500
Get me.

701
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,420
Get me.

702
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,680
Hey!

703
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,970
Choon Sung!

704
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,860
Nurse!

705
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,530
Nurse!

706
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:12,890
As you can see, because of Joon Young's
intestinal adhesion on the abdominal cavity...

707
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:17,620
We'll need to attach a catheter to his gallbladder
to take out the fluids.

708
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,690
- The fluids will be absorbed by the intestines.
- What were they worried about in Boston?

709
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,600
First, it was the intestinal adhesion.

710
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,000
Also, there is a risk of the catheter
falling out when attaching it.

711
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,120
If that happens,
what kind of problems will arise?

712
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,370
The fluids will leak and form inflammation.
This can get quite dangerous.

713
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,190
Dr. Park.

714
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,330
Is something wrong?

715
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,710
I agree with Dr. Cha.

716
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,380
The point where the catheter gets attached
seems to be the problem.

717
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,260
We can only solve that problem
after opening him up.

718
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,320
Professor Lee,
do you have anything to say?

719
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,370
Our neurosurgeon will open up the scalp

720
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,770
and place the catheter from the brain
to the abdominal cavity.

721
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,430
You should bring that line
to the gallbladder.

722
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:11,570
Yes.

723
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,590
This particular VP shunt is not any more
difficult than other VP shunt surgeries.

724
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:20,600
However, it was important to carry out
the idea into reality.

725
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,670
Fortunately, Dr. Cha took care of that.

726
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,910
Okay.

727
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,800
Let's get up.

728
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,950
Yes, sir.

729
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:45,600
Scalpel.

730
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,030
Forceps.

731
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,450
I've finished putting the catheter
to the abdominal cavity.

732
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,690
Okay.
Good job.

733
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,360
Scalpel.

734
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,630
Professor Kim.

735
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,400
Professor Kim.

736
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,350
Are you okay?

737
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,140
Professor Kim!

738
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,390
Professor Kim!
Get a hold of yourself!

739
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,450
Professor Kim!

740
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:38,990
I'm fine.

741
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,420
Professor Kim!

743
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:14,620
It wasn't a perfect surgery.

744
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:18,040
I think I should take your father,
and go down to Tae Back.

745
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,020
How can you discriminate against
patients based on their income?

746
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:23,850
Please reconsider.
He's not fit to be a chairman.

747
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:28,040
- Why should I do that?
- Just do it!

748
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,650
Children don't give up on the future.
There's no reason to give up surgery.
