2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,670
It's CBD perforation.

3
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,190
The bile seeping out
is creating bile tumors.

4
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,600
We need to remove them,
and start the cholangiojejunostomy.

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,170
- There's a high risk for infection.
- No, not the cholangiojejunostomy.

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,950
What do you mean?
That's the only option we have.

7
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,120
Park Shi On is right.

8
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,290
The biliary tract is too thin.

9
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,650
And the small intestine can't reach it.

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,960
Then...

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,760
Do you have another plan?

12
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,060
No.

13
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,950
The baby will be in danger
if we take any longer.

14
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,210
The baby is exhausted.

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,100
But, how did the biliary duct perforate?

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,110
Gallstones were blocking the biliary duct,
and the pressure made it burst.

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,440
The baby wasn't able to be fed
because of his bad liver.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,420
That's why the gallstones formed.

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,610
That's why I told him
this is a bad idea.

20
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,520
They can't just think
when there's no time.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,270
He's going to be put to shame.

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,840
How can you smile at a time like this?
The patient is about to die.

23
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,420
There's no other way?

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,300
As of now, there's nothing
we can do.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,870
Even if they remove the bile tumor,
they must be able to close up the perforation.

26
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,090
And...

27
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,100
I predict there will be problems with
the intestinal fistula created.

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,340
- Saturation level is down to 80.
- Check the endotracheal intubation tube.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,780
The tube is so narrow that it
keeps moving even if I hold it.

30
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,460
The body temperature has dropped
below 36 degrees.

31
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,400
Overall, everything is unstable.

32
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,280
Drainage tube...

33
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,440
If we drain, it will only suck out the bile.
It's not a solution.

34
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,300
Place the drainage tube to the side,
and we'll finish the operation.

35
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,820
What?

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,270
Go and bring the thinnest drainage tube.

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,810
Yes, sir.

38
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,040
The drainage may lead to an infection.

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,770
The current pressure in the bile duct is low.

40
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:16,840
Even if we can't stitch the perforation, we
can still drain the bile and prevent an infection.

41
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,510
And we can hope for a natural closing
of the perforation after the surgery.

42
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,410
PDS 6-0.

43
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,950
- Tie.
- Tie.

44
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,420
The part we mistook as an imaging artifact
was indeed a small gallstone.

45
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,750
That's why bile was accumulating
around it.

46
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,780
Park Shi On's judgment was right.

47
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,700
The biliary tract is already narrow.
Wouldn't we be making it even narrower?

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,360
If it gets severed, it will be hard for
natural sealing to occur.

49
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,690
We will make only a few stitches.

50
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,700
Here is the drainage tube.

51
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,750
Close the abdomen quickly.

52
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
Suture.

53
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,650
Tie.

54
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,360
There's no easy surgery.

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,280
Did everything go okay?

56
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,420
Yes.

57
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,800
I think they finished it off well.

58
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,560
Thank you for allowing us to
have the operation here.

59
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,800
I'm the one who should thank you.
For letting me witness a great surgery.

60
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,210
Thank you, Doctor.

61
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,460
For not giving up on our baby.

62
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,320
The baby is still at risk. We need
to continue to keep an eye on him.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,640
If the baby hangs on, we will be
able to take care of everything else.

64
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,940
Thank you.

65
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,820
We are thankful to the baby
for hanging on so well.

66
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,100
You should stop worrying,
and get some rest.

67
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,990
You didn't even get to recover
from delivering the baby.

68
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,640
Good job, Professor Kim.

69
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,740
It was nothing.

70
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,900
Still, we have things to discuss.

71
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,650
Come to the conference room
with Park Shi On.

72
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,150
You should go back to the station.

73
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,000
No, I should go, too.
I should get punished...

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,830
If I tell you to go,
just go.

75
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,840
You're not going?

76
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,870
What do you mean?
How can you lessen the punishment?

77
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,650
When the news of the surgery goes public,
we will get numerous consultation requests.

78
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,580
It would do more damage if
Dr. Kim Do Han takes leave for a month.

79
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,130
Still, a punishment is a punishment.

80
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,700
What do you mean?

81
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,450
This has a direct relationship to
the hospital's profitability.

82
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,910
I'm hoping we can also
go easy on Dr. Park Shi On.

83
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,090
How can we do that?
He's the one responsible for all this.

84
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,220
Isn't the core of the punishment
in finding out clearly who is responsible?

85
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,040
Dr. Park Shi On only followed
Professor Kim Do Han's orders.

86
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,150
Where is Dr. Park Shi On?

87
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm the one who should take
the responsibility.

88
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,730
If you have any punishment for Dr. Park,
I will relay it to him.

89
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,100
Why don't you just let this go?

90
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,770
Although the surgery was a success...

91
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,640
we cannot forget that
he broke the hospital rules.

92
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,840
We will suspend Professor Kim for a week,
and give him a month's pay cut.

93
00:08:53,050 --> 00:09:00,540
The suspension will start next Monday after he
completes the treatments for this week's patients.

94
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Do you have anything to say,
Professor Kim?

95
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,650
No.

96
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,450
And, Dr. Park will submit
a formal letter of apology.

97
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,580
What happened?

98
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,780
One week suspension,
and one month pay cut.

99
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,750
I didn't think they would
really do that.

100
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,580
It's not like he made a medical error.
He performed that difficult surgery.

101
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,090
Does this make sense?

102
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,990
That's what I'm saying.
What about Park Shi On?

103
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,790
He just needs to submit
a letter of apology.

104
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,060
I think the professor is taking
all the blame.

105
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,420
You, bastard!

106
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,170
How dare you show up here?

107
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,450
What do you think you're doing?

108
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,200
Aren't you angry?
He's the one who caused all of this.

109
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Il Kyu's right. Why does
the professor have to get punished?

110
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,750
Hey.

111
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,540
Don't you know how to apologize?

112
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,320
I guess you can't since you
have the mentality of a little kid.

113
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,810
- Il Kyu, watch what you say!
- Talking nice to him doesn't work.

114
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,270
Everyone, be quiet!

115
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,830
How dare you...

116
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,750
Act normally when Professor Kim comes.

117
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,410
If you overreact,
I'll kill all of you.

118
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,050
When you are a resident,
everyone can make a mistake.

119
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
I did as well.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,870
But, your attitude is what's important.

121
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,480
You really don't feel
guilty at all?

122
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,440
The baby can live now.
That's a relief.

123
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,670
I...

124
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm talking about our team,
not the baby!

125
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,740
If you keep this up, I won't be
able to cover up for your mistakes.

126
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,200
I don't feel any need to protect a staff
member who has no sense of teamwork.

127
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,410
Forget about asking me
if I'm okay.

128
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,070
I won't ask.

129
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,290
If you have nothing to report,
you can go.

130
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,460
Professor Kim.

131
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,040
I was clueless about the preemie's
surgery today.

132
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,960
I was wrong about the
imaging artifact.

133
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,620
And I was wrong about
Sung Ho, too.

134
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,260
But, Park Shi On was always right.

135
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:42,890
As you said before, medically speaking,
Park Shi On is a few steps ahead of me.

136
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,620
I admit that.

137
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,440
What do you want to say?

138
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,170
It's not envy or anything...

139
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,970
But, I do feel confused.

140
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,370
If he has the skills, I should help him
to stay in our department.

141
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,190
But, I'm not sure about
all of his other qualities.

142
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,600
Let me ask you one thing.

143
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,810
There are two different options.

144
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:13,180
First, a great doctor who has
no common sense.

145
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,940
Second, an average doctor
with common sense.

146
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,080
Which one would you choose?

147
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,060
A deficient genius becoming a hero
is only possible in comic books.

148
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,940
Rather than a comic book hero,
I need a partner I can communicate with.

149
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,580
In the end,
that's what will help the patient.

150
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,740
Then, why are you keeping
Park Shi On around?

151
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,620
Is it because of the director?

152
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,680
If you have nothing else to say,
you can leave.

153
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,850
I guess this is the kind of decision
that the leaders make...

154
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,590
This is how it is in a hierarchical society.

155
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,260
Please be understanding.

156
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,930
Park Shi On wasn't enough for you?

157
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,280
I thought you were only targeting
the director and Park Shi On.

158
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,770
But, now I'm thinking that
Professor Kim Do Han may be your target, too.

159
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,840
- You must be misunderstood.
- I hope this is a misunderstanding.

160
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,680
But, if Professor Kim Do Han
becomes a victim in your petty battle...

161
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,890
I won't just sit around.

162
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,120
As long as I'm here,
there will be no victims.

163
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,600
Done eating.

164
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm full now.

165
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,140
How is her condition?

166
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,400
Fortunately, the antibiotics worked,
so her condition has improved.

167
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,230
I'm sure she will be okay.

168
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,260
Still, you should continue to
take your medicine.

169
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,870
By the way...

170
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,140
Let's talk.
I have something to ask you.

171
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,620
Ask me here.

172
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,980
I have something to
say to you in private.

173
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,620
It looks like you lost weight.

174
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes...

175
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
I've been working a lot.

176
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,620
Take care of your health
while you're working.

177
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,680
If you're not well,
you should let me know.

178
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm fine.

179
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,830
You're so clueless.

180
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,970
You have no common sense.

181
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,860
Can't you tell by looking at them?

182
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,670
I guess Dr. Han's got great taste.
Right?

183
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,240
I bet you didn't get to meet
any girls when you were in school.

184
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,280
Do you know how popular I was?

185
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,240
Everybody wanted me...

186
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,710
Stop writing a novel.

187
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm good at dating.

188
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,840
Yeah, right.

189
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,270
He doesn't even have anywhere to go
on his day off. Do you think he's dating?

190
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,580
Is there someone you like
in the hospital?

191
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,800
Even if he does,
what good is that?

192
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,630
Who would like a monster?

193
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,760
What...

194
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,510
Even though I look like this now,
when I was young...

195
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,120
I always heard that
I was handsome like a sculpture.

196
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,540
Sculpture?

197
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,770
You're right about that...
Broken up pieces of a sculpture!

198
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,700
You...

199
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:56,010
How can you beat up a patient?

200
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,910
Dr. Cha, please go see Seo Joon.

201
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,590
Are you in your right mind?

202
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,690
What's going on?

203
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,960
This doctor brought this
for Seo Joon to eat.

204
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,570
He's not allowed to eat flour.
What's all this?

205
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,620
It's not made from flour.
It's made from rice powder.

206
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,310
And although cocoa is high in sugar,
it's okay.

207
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,980
Seo Joon is allowed to
eat food high in sugar.

208
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,820
Still, how can you feed him this?

209
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,100
Don't you have any common sense
as a doctor?

210
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
It's okay to eat it.
Once carbohydrate...

211
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,480
Forget it!
You should leave.

212
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,160
Get out!

213
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.
This will never happen again.

214
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,440
Don't eat it.
I'm going to throw it out.

215
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,910
The brain uses up 20 percent
of the oxygen that the body needs.

216
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,300
And it uses up 15 percent
of the body's blood.

217
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,040
To function well, it uses up
20 percent of the caloric intake.

218
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,590
So, if one does not eat food,
brain activities can become unstable

219
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,000
which leads to stress and insomnia.

220
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,050
So, you brought that because
you were worried about Seo Joon?

221
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,330
Yes, for his brain
and for him to get some sleep.

222
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,510
I understand.

223
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,610
I'm going to think that
it was out of good intentions.

224
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,870
But, this is a warning. Don't
change the diet plans for the patients.

225
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,320
Okay.

226
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,290
What's wrong with the vice president?

227
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,620
Why didn't you do something?
You should have done something!

228
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,610
I'm sorry.
It wasn't the situation...

229
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,210
Don't you know what an
important time this is?

230
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,780
We have to get rid of the director and
chairman for me to get that position.

231
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,270
Then, I'll be able to support you.

232
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,010
This time, plan something
behind the vice president's back.

233
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,100
What?

234
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,780
How can I...

235
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,530
Until when do I have to
spoon feed you?

236
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,460
Is your head there for decoration?

237
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,270
You're just like a human scanner.

238
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,400
If you just read it,
can you memorize it?

239
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,660
Yes, I can memorize it.

240
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,580
Good for you.

241
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,260
Being able to memorize as
you're reading...

242
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,630
Stop.
Don't do that.

243
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,630
Leave me be.
I'm not hitting him.

244
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,110
But...

245
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,160
even if you blabber on in the operating room
like some professor, we are not envious of you.

246
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,980
You should just go on some TV variety show,
instead of becoming a doctor.

247
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,330
Memory King, Park Shi On...
Something like that.

248
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,680
That suits you.

249
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,870
Forget it.
Stop.

250
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,210
Fine.

251
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,770
So, stop it.

252
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,330
Think about what I said.

253
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,790
Just think of it as a
one week break.

254
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,420
You haven't been able to
rest for even a day.

255
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,830
We should go to An Myun Do
on Monday.

256
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,120
What about your work?

257
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,290
Who's going to say something
when I say I'm taking off?

258
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,380
I've been thinking...

259
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,270
Can you leave the
pediatrics department?

260
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,720
You can go to the PBA department,
and become the head professor there.

261
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,450
I'm sure the chairman would
take care of that for you.

262
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,600
And...

263
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,900
You can work more comfortably.

264
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,180
That's the superficial reason.

265
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,810
I don't like that fact that you're in the middle
of the director and Park Shi On's relationship.

266
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,150
You don't need to get involved in the
middle of a political battle.

267
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm not a politician,
I'm a surgeon.

268
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,820
Don't worry about such nonsense.

269
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,310
You are my fiancee.
How can I not worry?

270
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,150
And don't get involved with my work.

271
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,610
I have no intention to
leave the pediatrics department.

272
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:31,740
Why not?

273
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,220
- Because of the director?
- No.

274
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,580
Then, why not?

275
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,150
Never mind.

276
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,320
Let's stop.

277
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,410
Did you know that you never told
me the reason?

278
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,850
If you're done eating,
let's leave.

279
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm a little tired today.

280
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,840
<i>Thank you for being sick.</i>

281
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,330
<i> - What did you say?
- That's not what I meant...</i>

282
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,720
- You're still very busy, right?
- Yes.

283
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,450
- Father's checking his insulin level, right?
- Of course.

284
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,830
<i>But, Do Han...</i>

285
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,840
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

286
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,080
Go ahead.

287
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,730
<i>Did you go to visit Soo Han?</i>

288
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,350
<i>I saw flowers there
when I visited.</i>

289
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,780
No, I didn't go.

290
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,370
<i>I thought maybe you did.</i>

291
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,070
<i>Make sure you eat on time,
and come visit us soon.</i>

292
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
Okay, Mother.

293
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,580
Yes.

294
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,540
You didn't get to sleep last night?

295
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,160
You don't look so well.

296
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,630
I'm fine.

297
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,320
Just a bit tired.

298
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,080
You can't collapse.

299
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,980
Who will operate on our children?

300
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,760
I'm going to be the only
one working around here?

301
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,160
You should try performing
some surgeries, too.

302
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
What?

303
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,790
You think I'm ready?

304
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,030
I started the first year
of my fellowship.

305
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,930
Isn't this your second year?

306
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,950
Then, you should give me
specific orders.

307
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:22,820
If there is a patient with esophageal atresia,
you should perform the surgery.

308
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,950
Yes, sir.

309
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,010
Here.

310
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:50,020
You're going to the bathroom,
and passing gas?

311
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,470
Yes.

312
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,910
Like this.

313
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,740
See? I said you would get better
if you listen to me.

314
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,870
Can I go home now?

315
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,850
Let's stay a bit longer.
Three nights...

316
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,870
No, four nights.

317
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,500
That long?

318
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,720
Aren't you happy that you get to
look at my pretty face longer?

319
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,030
You always say that you're pretty.

320
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,660
Doctor.

321
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,160
Can you speak with us for
a moment?

322
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,180
What are you doing here?

323
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,850
You can't tell our parents.

324
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,860
It's been awhile since we've
had chips.

325
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,420
Okay.
I won't tell.

326
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,470
You mean that?
Really?

327
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,520
Yes.

328
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,100
But...

329
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,670
I...

330
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Can I play with you, too?

331
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,630
With us?

332
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,820
Yes.

333
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,340
But, if you want to join our team,
there's a condition.

334
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,530
But, there's a condition if you want
to join our team.

335
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,190
We have limited staff in our department.
It's hard to make shift changes.

336
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,060
We understand,
but we feel very uneasy.

337
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,660
Yesterday, Seo Joon went through
so much because of the food.

338
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,410
What if he makes a mistake with
the medicine or an injection?

339
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,760
That won't happen.
Don't worry.

340
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,540
What's going on, Dr. Park?

341
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,450
Seo Joon!

342
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,740
Dr. Park did this!

343
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,960
He dropped everything that
was piled up there.

344
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,110
Why?
Why did he do that?

345
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,390
Because we said
we wouldn't play with him.

346
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,960
What?

347
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,260
Dr. Park, what's wrong with you?

348
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,180
That's not it...

349
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,070
That's not it...

350
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,060
I knew it.
I knew he was like this.

351
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,760
What did I say?
I told you something bad would happen!

352
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,060
Nurse Jo, please move the children
to the treatment room.

354
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,100
- What's going on?
- Please hurry.

355
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,980
What is this?

356
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,140
Ye Eun!
- It's an emergency!

357
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,380
What's the use in memorizing
all of these books?

358
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,210
What good is it if you have
special talents?

359
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,660
There is no one who
wants you to be a doctor!

360
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,510
Still, I have to become a doctor.

361
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,410
What will you do
when you become a doctor?

362
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,470
You think it's all about having
a successful surgery?

363
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,300
I'm sick and tired of getting
disappointed by you daily.

364
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,320
I shouldn't get angry,
but I still get angry.

365
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,430
This is a big problem.

366
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,220
How can a doctor beat up
his patients?

367
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,210
It doesn't seem like an act of violence.
It seems like it was an accident.

368
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,790
- What?
- I will report it to the director.

369
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,190
You should go.

370
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,790
This is not a small issue.

371
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,310
I'll take care of it.

372
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,870
You should worry about
your own duties.

373
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,290
This time, you should plan something
behind the vice president's back.

374
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,300
This is part of my duty.

375
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,590
As the manager of the pediatrics department,
I will take care of this.

376
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,550
We can't just let this go.

377
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,110
We want him removed from
the hospital floor.

378
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,940
I want to do that, but there
is a hierarchy in the hospital.

379
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,910
Isn't it in your powers to
remove a resident?

380
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,980
Yes, but Dr. Park was specifically hired in the
hospital's effort to rehabilitate his handicap.

381
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,650
It's a bit different.

382
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,980
Then, who do we need to speak to?

383
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,520
First, speak to the director.

384
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,060
It's better if you have a specific complaint
or a signed petition.

385
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,230
It would be even better if you bring this
to the board committee of the foundation.

386
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,860
Really?

387
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,240
- I guess we can sign the petition.
- Will that work?

388
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,130
I understand.

389
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,860
If there are any other problems,
report to me right away.

390
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,790
- Then, Dr. Park did that on purpose?
- On purpose?

391
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,000
He didn't do it on purpose.
He was just holding on to it when it fell.

392
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,750
Then, why did you say it
like Dr. Park did that on purpose?

393
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,200
Because we were really scared then.

394
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,770
He was just trying to get close
to you guys.

395
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:50,260
Still, I don't like him.
He's scary.

396
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,030
He's so strange.

397
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,880
First, remove Dr. Park from
his patients.

398
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,860
Then the rest of the doctors
will have too many patients.

399
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,170
This is not my opinion.
It's the opinion of the guardians.

400
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,090
At this rate,
he'll end up killing someone.

401
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,010
Don't you think that's too extreme?

402
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,050
How can you say that
when you saw it for yourself?

403
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,750
I did see it myself, but he
didn't hurt the kids on purpose.

404
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,680
In the end, the kids did get hurt!

405
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,430
We shouldn't have accepted him
in the first place.

406
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,930
Everything he says...

407
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,120
Remove him from patient care,
but leave him on the floor.

408
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,670
Just have him check the orders.

409
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,420
Where does it hurt?

410
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,670
Here.

411
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,490
Here.

412
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,850
Here?

413
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:14,920
It hurts there like
boogle, boogle, woogle, woogle...

414
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:19,230
What does that mean?

415
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,280
Let me take a look.

416
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,690
What are you doing?
You're the one who hurt them.

417
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,440
What are you trying to do now?

418
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
He won't do anything to hurt her.

419
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,310
Be quiet.

420
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,980
Don't even think about coming near
our kids again.

421
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,810
Still, I should take a look.

422
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:39,310
I said it's fine!
Just go.

423
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,340
Hurry!

424
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,610
Please work hard for the week.
Call me in case of an emergency.

425
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,340
We will take care of everything.

426
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,730
Don't worry, and take this
opportunity to get some rest.

427
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,190
Hearing that you'll take care of everything,
is the scariest thing to me.

428
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,890
While I'm gone,
follow Dr. Cha's orders.

429
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,210
Yes, sir.

430
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,010
Dr. Cha, you should go see the
preemie's parents.

431
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,370
Yes, sir.

432
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,490
Work hard.

433
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,950
While I'm gone, don't do anything other
than eating, sleeping, and breathing.

434
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,760
You.

435
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,170
You don't like to see people
in pain, right?

436
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,660
Right, I don't like that.
I hate that very much.

437
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:45,380
Then, think hard about how your
selfish actions hurt your colleagues.

438
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,090
- Are you in the pediatrics department?
- Yes.

439
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,830
We are from the NS department.

440
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,650
Do you want to play with us?

441
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,930
How are you feeling?

442
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,140
Thanks to you, I feel fine.

443
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,950
How is our baby doing?

444
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,330
His breathing is weak,
but he will be okay soon.

445
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,470
Who drew that for you?

446
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,600
It's so good.

447
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,940
That doctor.

448
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,780
Dr. Park Shi On.

449
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,000
<i>I named the baby.</i>

450
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,650
<i>"Dong" meaning movement.
And "Soo" meaning hand.</i>

451
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,620
<i>It means that he moves
his hands well.</i>

452
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:10,940
<i>When Dong Soo grows up, he'll be good at
basketball, volleyball, and baseball...</i>

453
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,320
<i>just like my brother.</i>

454
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,170
<i>That's why we decided to name our baby
Dong Soo. Lee Dong Soo.</i>

455
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,230
<i>It's a name given by the man
who saved our baby.</i>

456
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,120
<i>I think he will lead a long life.</i>

457
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,770
Good job.

458
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,110
Don't grasp it too hard.

459
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
You'll get tired.

460
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,340
Thank you.

461
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,830
What do we do about Seo Joon?

462
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,410
- Why?
- He won't eat.

463
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,150
And he's very lethargic due to
lack of sleep.

464
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,470
That's not good for him.
He'll be discharged in a few days.

465
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,010
He wants to go to sleep,
but he can't.

466
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,510
He just keeps on counting sheep.

467
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,990
It's not like we can give him sleeping pills.
What about his mom?

468
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:02,470
- She went to work.
- Hmm...

469
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,470
I'll go check up on him.

470
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,980
Dr. Park, you shouldn't...

471
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,540
Let him be.

472
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,250
Ten sheep.

473
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,440
Eleven sheep.

474
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,760
Twelve sheep.

475
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,040
Go away.

476
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,920
Are you here to bother me again?

477
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,340
No.

478
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,530
I'm here because you can't
fall asleep.

479
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,020
Don't talk to me.

480
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,760
Thirteen sheep.

481
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,680
Fourteen sheep.

482
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,350
There's no point in counting sheep.

483
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,370
Why not?

484
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,330
- Do you know how to speak English?
- Of course, I'm the best one in my class.

485
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,010
How do you say 'sheep' in English?

486
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,790
- Sheep.
- That's right.

487
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,180
Then, how do you say 'sleep'
in English?

488
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,210
- Sleep.
- That's right.

489
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:03,430
Sheep and sleep sound alike,
that's why Americans count sheep.

490
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,530
Then, it's useless to count
sheep in Korean?

491
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,670
Yes.

492
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,770
Only the people who count in English
can fall asleep.

493
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,970
Then...

494
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,560
I should count something that
sounds like sleep in Korean.

495
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,290
What can I count?

496
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,030
How about dragonflies?

497
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,810
One dragonfly.

498
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,370
Two dragonfly.

499
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,440
That's right!

500
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,520
One dragonfly.

501
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,600
Two dragonfly.

502
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,690
I really think I'm going to fall asleep.

503
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,760
Three dragonfly.

504
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,990
Four dragonfly.

505
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,720
Five dragonfly.

506
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,610
Yes, Chairman.

507
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,520
Excuse me?

508
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:11,130
You should have told me earlier.

509
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,310
Yes.

510
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,180
I will be right there.

511
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,030
Okay.

512
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,690
You shouldn't be moving around so much.
Just stay in the room.

513
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,300
That way, you'll get better soon.

514
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,460
Okay.

515
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,710
You're not being serious.

516
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,050
Look at me.

517
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,920
Okay, okay...

518
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,330
But, where are you working
night shifts?

519
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,710
At a convenience store.

520
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,480
I knew it.
You don't look well.

521
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,040
It must be hard.

522
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,150
I'm fine.
Just focus on getting better.

523
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,820
Okay.

524
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,160
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,250
Don't say that.

526
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,200
I'm going.

527
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,860
In Young!

528
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,650
Yes, Dr. Han.

529
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,160
Since you're busy,
I'll get to the point.

530
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,750
Is In Hye's condition getting worse?

531
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,330
No, it's not that.

532
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,710
Do you have time this weekend?

533
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,100
I got two tickets to a musical.

534
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,740
If you have time,
I wanted to go with you.

535
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,810
I'm sorry.

536
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,640
Thank you for your gesture, but I feel a bit
uncomfortable as a patient's guardian.

537
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:06,640
I hope you won't do this again.

538
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,750
Wait...

539
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,150
He may be good looking,
but he's got no skills.

540
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:20,220
Are all doctors like that?

541
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,660
- Why is he so lacking?
- That's what I'm saying...

542
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,640
That's all he can do?

543
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,150
Even if I give him a chance,
he can't do it.

544
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,570
Nice!

545
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,580
He's got a really nice swing.

546
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,040
You should have rested first,
why did you call me out here?

547
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,840
I feel better when I look at
healthy kids.

548
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,490
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, you're right.

549
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,680
How much longer do you need?

550
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,440
I will finish it
within three months time.

551
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,750
Your specialty is speed,
but I guess this is different.

552
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,840
I'm sorry.

553
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,500
No.

554
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,840
I'm sure you have your reasons.

555
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:17,600
May I ask what brings you to Korea?

556
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,570
I just came to see you.

557
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:30,690
Even the gold-laying goose won't
lay eggs if it's not fed.

558
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,570
Just don't make him starve.

559
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,780
But, don't feed him too much.

560
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,790
Okay.

561
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,180
I'll remember that.

562
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,840
Why did you ask me to come?

563
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,340
What do you mean?

564
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,870
Even though we work in the same building,
I never get to see you.

565
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,140
You haven't come to see me
at all these days.

566
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,310
I'm sorry.

567
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,000
You know how busy it is
in our department.

568
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,420
Yeah.
I know you guys have a lot of work.

569
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,380
When you were young, you used to
visit him quite often with requests.

570
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:24,110
That's before you became
my father's wife.

571
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,720
Let's just eat.

572
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:35,740
No, I don't think I can just
sit here and eat at a time like this.

573
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,210
Chae Kyung.

574
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,350
Why are you being over-sensitive?

575
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,450
Do Han was suspended because
of Dr. Park.

576
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:51,240
Vice President Kang and Chief Manager Lee
are looking for a way to remove the two of you.

577
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,360
But, you two are so relaxed.

578
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,080
The director and I will
take care of that.

579
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,290
Don't worry about that,
and just focus on your work.

580
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:01,420
I can't not worry about it.

581
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,570
After all the work my father
put into the hospital.

582
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,120
- You have to talk like that?
- Yes.

583
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,520
That way you'll be a bit
more tense.

584
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,520
This is all my fault.

585
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,160
I won't make you worry
in the future.

586
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,190
Eat.

587
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,970
I'm done talking, so we should eat.

588
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:05,000
<i>My brother's nail looks like
a crescent moon.</i>

589
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,820
<i>Crescent moon.</i>

590
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,320
He needs the surgery right away!

591
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,610
<i>He needs the surgery right away!</i>

592
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,050
Park Shi On.

593
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,690
What kind of a person are you?

594
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,480
One dragonfly.

595
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,680
Two dragonfly.

596
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,530
Three dragonfly.

597
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,410
Five dragonfly.

598
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,350
We're sorry, but we don't have a specialist
who deals with pediatric emergencies.

599
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,270
What do you mean?
There must be other doctors here.

600
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,490
There's only interns here, it will be hard.
We will escort you to a nearby hospital.

601
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:39,420
It's a case of intussusception.

602
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,870
Looking at her condition,
she needs immediate surgery.

603
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,100
We don't have any
pediatric specialists here.

604
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,020
You must have other doctors here.

605
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,420
You see...

606
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,320
They all have their specialties.

607
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,180
And they don't have much experience
in pediatric surgery.

608
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,910
You should go to a big hospital
with a pediatrics department.

609
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,020
Be careful.

610
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,910
It's so good to be out.

611
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,710
You're enjoying this, too.
Right?

612
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,240
Please.

613
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,490
Let's enjoy our vacation.

614
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,140
The icterus is almost gone.
It's almost in the normal range now.

615
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,060
The liver somatic level will soon be normal,
so don't worry so much.

616
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,870
Yes.

617
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,810
Okay.

618
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,980
There's an 8 year old patient
with intussusception in the ER.

619
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,410
She was transferred here
in very bad condition.

620
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,350
Dr. Park, follow us.

621
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,050
She was brought here with intussusception
diagnosis, so we called for you.

622
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,030
She's had stomach pains and hematochezia
since 10 hours ago. She is dehydrated.

623
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,360
- Vitals?
- P-bar 39, B/P 80/40, heart rate is 150.

624
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,660
Ventilatory frequency is 30 times,
and saturation is 85 percent.

625
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,780
She has unstable breathing.

626
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,220
If respiratory aspiration occurred while vomiting,
it my be aspiration pneumonia.

627
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,340
No other hospital would accept her. We were
searching all night, and finally came to Seoul.

628
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,650
We've been to five different hospitals.

629
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,980
Five hospitals!

630
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,410
Run a blood test.
And arrange for an operating room.

631
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,870
Let's look at the test results.

632
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,410
The intussusception is long.
As Dr. Park said, she has aspiration pneumonia.

633
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,620
Give her a triple amount of antibiotics,
and prepare for surgery.

634
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,160
- I don't feel good about this.
- It's the worst.

635
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,430
I hope she doesn't go into cardiac arrest
before the surgery.

636
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:35,970
What will happen to our child?

637
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,260
We will have to start the surgery,
and see her condition.

638
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,650
Hurry, and call for Professor...
No, call for the manager.

639
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,740
Okay.

640
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,390
It's cardiac arrest!

641
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,510
Start massaging.

642
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:11,060
Bring an extra IV line. Prepare atropine,
epinephrine, and the intubation set.

643
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,450
What is it?

644
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,740
<i>We have a patient with intussusception.
Dr. Cha asked to call you.</i>

645
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,110
Fine, I'll be right there.

646
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,050
What?

647
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,140
Are you in your right mind?
It's already too late.

648
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,230
As soon as you open her up,
she will go into cardiac arrest!

649
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,950
Still, we can't send a patient
to another hospital.

650
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:50,260
If something goes wrong, we'll be blamed.
There may be a lawsuit.

651
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,180
Fearing that, you will
turn down an urgent patient?

652
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,020
It's for our department and the hospital.
Don't you understand?

653
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,280
I will perform the surgery.

654
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,760
Why...

655
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,060
Why doesn't anyone
listen to me?

656
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,670
Because you don't talk like a doctor.

657
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,960
What?

658
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,810
I'll think about taking on the blame
later on.

659
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,160
Dr. Cha!

660
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,250
Dr. Cha!

661
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,940
We reserved an operating room.
But, who will perform the surgery?

662
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,250
The manager has no intention
of performing it.

663
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:31,710
Then...

664
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,430
You...

665
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,060
We can save her!

666
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,940
We can save her!

667
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,470
We have to save her!

668
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,520
First, transport the patient.

669
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:44,730
I'm just about to go in.

670
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,850
I'll have to take charge.

671
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,050
No, don't do it.
I'll do it.

672
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,970
What's your plan?

673
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,890
Show me the surgery through
my cell phone while I drive there.

674
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,580
No, I'll do it.

675
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,840
Listen to me!

676
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,770
I decide when your first surgery will be.

677
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,390
<i>Don't attempt manual reposition.</i>

678
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,850
Find the upper and lower intestine
that look good.

679
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,790
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

680
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,670
It's an emergency.
I have to go to the hospital.

681
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,420
There are other doctors there.

682
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,550
I'll be back after the surgery.

683
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,770
Wait for me.

684
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,910
Do Han!

685
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,840
Do Han!

686
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,530
- How is it progressing?
- We just finished the anesthesia.

687
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,410
- What about Professor Kim?
- It keeps ringing, but he's not picking up.

688
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,150
You better stop now!

689
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,170
This is my last warning.

690
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,910
Stop the surgery.

691
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:22,940
The surgeon, Cha Yoon Seo,
will start the surgery.

692
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,760
Dr. Cha!

693
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,350
Turn it off.

694
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:33,130
Dr. Cha!

695
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,110
Dr. Cha!

696
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,470
Please start.

697
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,910
Scalpel.

698
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:26,190
The small intestine is stuck
inside the large intestine.

699
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:31,420
- Then, even the large intestine...
- You can't cut off the large intestine.

700
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,010
First, we need to reposition
the small intestine as much as we can.

701
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,380
Let's start.

702
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,920
Careful.
Careful.

703
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,610
Careful.

704
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,840
Shut your mouth.

705
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,550
The intestines are out.

706
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,860
Let's begin the removal of
small intestines.

707
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,680
Clamp.

708
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,600
- Tie.
- Tie.

709
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,410
One more.

710
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,610
Hold it.

711
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,490
Dr. Park, are you okay?

712
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:43,750
The child's not moving well.

713
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,220
Obviously not, she's anesthetized.

714
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,730
That's not what I meant...

715
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,180
You better focus!

716
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:55,660
We are finished removing the
damaged small intestine.

717
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,990
We will start anastomosis
for the remaining parts.

718
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,270
It's cardiac arrest!

719
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,710
I will give her atropine.

720
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,450
Change the drip rate.
Bring the DC.

721
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,590
I'm going to start CPR.

722
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,890
One, two, three.

723
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,970
Stop for a moment.
Let me check the rhythm of her heart.

724
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:43,020
Start again.

725
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,840
The heart rhythm has returned a bit.

726
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,920
The DC is ready.

727
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,760
50 Joules.

728
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,920
Move away.

729
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:07,440
Shock!

730
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,820
- It's dropping again!
- Raise to 100 joules.

731
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,830
Shock!

732
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,610
The rhythm's not coming back.

733
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,110
Please...

734
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,430
Please...

735
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,270
Professor Kim.

736
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,710
Please...

737
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:14,190

738
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,300
Is that how a Doctor is
supposed to act?

739
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,340
I'll perform the surgery.

740
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,100
Since when have you had a
relationship with the doctor?

741
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,860
I'm jealous of Dr. Cha.

742
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:38,950
You really never listen.

743
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,560
You're smart, Doctor.

744
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:45,400
Santa Claus and heaven are the same.
They don't exist.

745
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,790
Why isn't there a heaven?

746
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:50,500
I've devoted my life to pediatrics,
not an operation factory.

747
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,230
Do you know you're acting like
Park Shi On right now?

748
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,830
Have you forgotten that we're
bound to a policy?

749
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,600
Thank you, Park Shi On.

750
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,590
Thanks to you,
I've become a professional.
