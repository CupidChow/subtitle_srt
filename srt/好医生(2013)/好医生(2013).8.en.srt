2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,100
What do you want?

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,260
I brought a cop to
escort Eun Ok home.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,980
Instead of a cop, you should've
brought legal court papers.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,250
I want to bring home my niece.
Why do I need those papers?

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,550
Excuse me, I said no!

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,300
Seriously!

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,040
No!

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,430
You can't take Eun Ok!

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,960
Never!

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,440
Dr. Park.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,310
Eun Ok doesn't want to go home.

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,920
- She doesn't like you.
- Who are you?

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,340
I'm Park Shi On, the resident who was
in charge of Eun Ok until yesterday.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,140
How did you come back?

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,960
The director told me to come back.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,000
He told me I was proven innocent.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,230
Really?

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,270
Yes.

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,110
I didn't do that.

21
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,290
The director believed me.

22
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,320
Okay.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,820
First, let's take care of that lady.

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,150
What are you going to do?

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,040
We should let Eun Ok
do as she wishes.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,900
We can ask Eun Ok whether she wants
to go with her aunt, or stay here.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,690
She can't even talk.
Why would we ask her?

28
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,820
She can express herself.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,170
We can tell how she feels.

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,450
Fine!

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,800
Let's do it.

32
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,230
What a joke.

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,320
<i>Let's discuss the details over dinner.</i>

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,150
I'm sure you will like
what I have to say.

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,340
Yes, Director Kim.

36
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,260
Let's go home, Eun Ok!

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,120
Stop screaming.

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,970
Eun Ok, I'm here.

39
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,000
Eun Ok, do you want to go home
with your aunt?

40
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,290
Then...

41
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,750
do you want to stay here
with this doctor?

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes...

43
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,530
Yes...

44
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,170
She can talk now!

45
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,310
She talked!

46
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,690
I think she just said, 'yes.'

47
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,320
What is with her?

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,640
Eun Ok!

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,600
Madame.

50
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,710
She seems to want to stay here.

51
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,120
It doesn't look like she's in
good enough condition to take her.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,340
You should keep her here
until she's better.

53
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,840
If you are unhappy,
you should go see a lawyer, not us.

54
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,050
Eun Ok, you are very, very pretty.

55
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,360
I love you.

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,650
What do you mean
Park Shi On didn't do that?

57
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,140
According to these papers...

58
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,430
You can see the exact time
that Dr. Park locked the door.

59
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:14,810
At the bottom, you can see an 'F' mark
four minutes after Dr. Park locked the door.

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,530
So, who's the one that
opened the door?

61
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,900
It's not that somebody opened the door.
The machine malfunctioned.

62
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,520
I heard that multiple mobile equipment
inside the hospital sometimes clash.

63
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,470
So, are you saying that Dr. Park
is not at fault?

64
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,740
Yes, that is correct.

65
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:41,520
If nobody has any objections,
we will rehire Dr. Park.

66
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,120
Still, this is a good thing.

67
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,300
Park Shi On...

68
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,190
That was our chance to kick him out.

69
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,580
We should have kicked him out, and I
should have looked for a way to protect you.

70
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,720
I can't stand to see your fate
depending on Park Shi On anymore.

71
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,080
I know how you feel.

72
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,430
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,700
From now on, I'll find a way.

74
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,170
The most clever way.

75
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,850
Wait...

76
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,290
Why...

77
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,610
If you had just stayed quiet,
this would have ended.

78
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,360
I don't have the power to
cover up security matters.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,650
Who are they?
You could have just let this go.

80
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,890
It was reported to the director as well.
There was nothing I could do.

81
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,120
You!

82
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,320
What happened?

83
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,440
Didn't you unlock the door yourself?

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,450
Well... there were so many people around,
I couldn't do it.

85
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,000
Then, why didn't you tell me?

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,830
I was going to,
but the door happened to be open.

87
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,990
Damn...

88
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,940
I knew this would happen.

89
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,220
Dr. Park can never lie.

90
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,890
Don't be too happy.

91
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,300
We have trouble back in our hands.

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,370
Then, can we put him back to work?

93
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,670
Yes.

94
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,580
Are you that happy?

95
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,320
Yes.

96
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,320
I feel like I've found a
long-lost little brother.

97
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,920
In the 10 years that I've known you,
you look the happiest today.

99
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,070
It's not that much...

100
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,530
Take care of your brother
from now on.

101
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,990
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,770
Get up.

103
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,110
Let's go.

104
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,410
Okay.

105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,110
You're such a cruel kid...

106
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,380
How could you go away
just like that?

107
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,580
Don't be upset anymore.

108
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,850
Everyone believes you.

109
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,330
Hiccups again?

110
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,940
Then, Park Shi On's coming back?

111
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,440
Why not?

112
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,010
I was sad when he was gone,
but now that he's back, I feel troubled.

113
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,590
I feel that way, too.

114
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,760
It's hard as it is, but if he
creates another problem...

115
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,020
Don't you think that
he's great?

116
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,730
I've never expressed it, but I'm
amazed by him during every surgery.

117
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,950
- There's a lot to learn from him.
- We acknowledge that.

118
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,730
But...
That's not everything.

119
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,690
I'm not happy.

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,310
You know that he's more nerve-wrecking
than medical emergencies.

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,370
The troublemaker is back.

122
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,350
You...

123
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,940
It's only been a day,
but it seems like it's been a year.

124
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,540
I'm really, really
happy to be back.

125
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,910
Good for you that
you're very, very happy.

126
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,380
Dr. Woo, what's wrong with you?

127
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,490
It's nothing.

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,310
That punk...

129
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,290
Nothing has changed.

130
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,250
Continue what you've been doing.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,680
Then...
can I still be in charge of Eun Ok?

132
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,430
Yes.

133
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,550
Pay special attention,
so there aren't any more troubles.

134
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,960
Yes, sir.

135
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,060
Professor Kim.

136
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,050
I was thinking about throwing
Dr. Park a welcome party tonight.

137
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,560
We never got to have one
when he first came in.

138
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,070
I like that idea.
What about you guys?

139
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,260
- Do as you wish.
- Okay.

140
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,090
Yes!

141
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,240
What do you want to eat?

142
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,300
I'll eat anything.

143
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,990
Hurry, and tell me.

144
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,510
I want to drink!

145
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,590
Alcohol is like arrowroots.

146
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,680
It's bitter in the beginning,
but it becomes sweet after a while.

147
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,530
Oh no...

148
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,930
You've grown a taste for it.

149
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,340
<i>For security reasons,
the title isn't written on it.</i>

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,660
What is this?

151
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,290
It's a plan for our hospital and the
Pediatrics Surgery Department to gain power.

152
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,490
At the same time...

153
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,810
It will guarantee Dr. Park Shi On's future.

154
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,770
Read over the content,
and let me know your thoughts.

155
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,010
What do you think I should do?

156
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,430
I want to solve everything
on my own.

157
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,120
But, I don't know what to do.

158
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,900
You don't want to join the fight because
it feels like you are becoming trash, too.

159
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,630
Actually, I'm against that as well.

160
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,330
It's demeaning.

161
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,430
What if...

162
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,430
I become the chairwoman?

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,590
You just need to marry me, and
we can take care of everything after.

164
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,840
And you don't have to get
involved in this dirty fight.

165
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,880
That's the surest way.

166
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,730
What about the current chairwoman?

167
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,190
Nothing will change.

168
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,470
She will just give up her seat.

169
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,260
- And how will you become the chairwoman?
- Well...

170
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm sure there's a way.

171
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,450
Yes, I hope that comes true.

172
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,970
You can take away my worries, then.

173
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,810
But, Dr. Park...

174
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,370
How did you get Eun Ok to talk?

175
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,940
I kept asking her.

176
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,120
What did you ask her?

177
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,470
Are you hungry?

178
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,650
Are you hurting?

179
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,690
Are you sleepy?
Are you surprised?

180
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,290
Do you want food?

181
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,230
You made her talk with
those questions?

182
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,800
Those are the words that
Eun Ok's mom used to say.

183
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,410
Still, if her parents died
when she was three...

184
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,030
she probably wouldn't remember.

185
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,470
No, she knows that
she used to have a mother.

186
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,950
She can't be sure,
but she can faintly remember.

187
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,770
The one she missed the most
was her mom.

188
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,790
Who do you want to see the most
right now?

189
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,690
Mom...

190
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,150
Mom...

191
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,150
And when we were alone, I told her
that she is pretty and that I love her.

192
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,520
You were like a mother to her.

193
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,190
Yes.

194
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,490
But...

195
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,010
I'm envious of Eun Ok.

196
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,460
I don't remember anything.

197
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,250
Mom and dad's faces...

198
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,920
Their voices...
Their scent...

199
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,960
Things we did together...
I can't remember anything.

200
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,780
I only remember my brother.

201
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,990
I'm sure my mom used to tell
me that she loved me, too.

202
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,460
Thank you.

203
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,530
Thank you.

204
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,470
Don't worry anymore,
and take care of your health.

205
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,990
Soon, I will arrange
for the two of you to meet.

206
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,620
Not in the hospital,
but somewhere nice.

207
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,440
Of course, I'll act
like I don't know anything.

208
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,060
Thank you.

209
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,100
Thank you.

210
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,980
Doctor!

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,470
If you are back,
you should have told me.

212
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,500
My neck...
Let go...

213
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,130
Come on, tell me that
you are happy to see me.

214
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,910
I missed you.
I'm happy to see you.

215
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,790
How much?

216
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,010
A lot.

217
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,750
Good.
Of course, you missed me a lot.

218
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,290
In Hye...

219
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,560
You are my friend, right?

220
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,100
Of course, I'm your one and only friend.

221
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,550
There's something I want to know.
Can I ask you?

222
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,570
Of course.
Ask me anything.

223
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,360
So...

224
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,400
When her hand touches you, or if
you embrace her, you keep hiccuping?

225
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,910
Yes, although there's no problem
with my diaphragm or respiration.

226
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,160
When I hugged you before,
you didn't hiccup, right?

227
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,770
No.

228
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,850
How do you feel when you hiccup?

229
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,510
It feels like I'm watching the
national team winning the world cup.

230
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,080
It feels like I'm going up in
an elevator outdoors.

231
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,720
It feels like smelling perfume
while eating chocolate ice cream.

232
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,170
First...

233
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,600
Who the heck is she?

234
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,320
Did you... just curse?

235
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,560
Fine, I won't do it.
Who is the girl?

236
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,910
Tell me.

237
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,310
You're driving me crazy.

238
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,080
You told me this much,
and now it's a secret?

239
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,740
Fine, tell me later.

240
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,760
For starters, you like that woman.

241
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,050
I like her?

242
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,410
Yes.
As a woman.

243
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,630
As someone of the opposite sex.

244
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,480
<i>It's a common symptom of first love.</i>

245
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,180
<i>But...</i>

246
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,440
<i>You really can't tell me
who the girl is?</i>

247
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,590
Wow...

248
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,690
He's really good.

249
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,480
I heard that he got invited to go
study abroad in Germany.

250
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,540
Then, he won't have to study
English like we do.

251
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,320
He's lucky.

252
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,460
I can sing like that, too.

253
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,140
Watch.

254
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,250
What are you saying?

255
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,890
How beautiful.

256
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,140
Is that kid famous?

257
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,060
Yes!
He came out on TV recently.

258
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,610
Now, it's my turn.

259
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,290
What's this noise?

260
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,470
It sounds like a pig howling.

261
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,680
Pig...

262
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,910
Howling...

263
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,260
Stop laughing.

264
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,390
He said you sound like a pig.

265
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,360
Close your eyes tightly,
and listen carefully.

266
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,830
It sounds so nice, right?

267
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,990
Doesn't it feel like you're
in heaven?

268
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,350
Picture your mother in your head.

269
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,850
Even if you can't remember.

270
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,070
I will picture mine, too.

271
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,300
You won't come to Park Shi On's
welcoming party?

272
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,690
No.

273
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,460
I have prior plans.

274
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,810
Then, you can come after.

275
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,850
You guys should just go and enjoy.

276
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,270
And...

277
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,460
It's been a while.
Drink until you die.

278
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,240
Thank you.

279
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,910
I didn't tell the manager
on purpose.

280
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,110
I have to go.

281
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,880
Professor Kim.

282
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,960
After tonight, how about getting
Park Shi On to start a normal residency life?

283
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,740
Instead of retiring every night.

284
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,430
It's not over, yet.

285
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,130
I haven't changed my thoughts.

286
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,410
Here you go.

287
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,500
What is it that you
wanted to tell me?

288
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,010
I'm planning to make pediatrics surgery
the central department in our hospital.

289
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,810
We are struggling to survive as it is...
Do you think that's possible?

290
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,110
Of course.

291
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,920
I plan to make the
pediatrics surgery department

292
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,720
free from any financial problems
or staff shortage.

293
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,870
- I think your plan is too idealistic.
- Professor Kim.

294
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,450
I'm a businessman.

295
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,840
I don't even look at
impossible things.

296
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,410
There's something else I
can't understand.

297
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,900
Isn't this something
that wouldn't benefit your side?

298
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,060
I'm not on any side.

299
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,630
It was just a process to
separate the jewels from the stones.

300
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,020
Here.
Have a drink.

301
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,640
Professor Kim.

302
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,960
I am on your team now.

303
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,920
I even have an investor
who will support our team.

304
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:24,290
The investor respects you and
the pediatrics surgery department.

305
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,900
For Dr. Park!

306
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,060
Can we take part when this is a welcoming
party for the pediatrics surgery department?

307
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,640
Don't say that.

308
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,680
We are all one family.

309
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,710
I like family... I've been
waiting to get together like this.

310
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,200
Dr. Park, we are here for you.
You should say something.

311
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Those are sea snails!

312
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,390
This is the first time anyone has said
those words at their welcoming party.

313
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,080
But, where are the others?

314
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,030
They had to stay at the hospital.

315
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,240
They just didn't come
because they don't like Dr. Park...

316
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,340
Watch it!

317
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,020
You are so clueless...

318
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,550
Just a few years back...

319
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,000
huge crowds used to show up for pediatrics
surgery department welcoming parties.

320
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,570
That was a long time ago.

321
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,450
Only fools come to our department now.

322
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,020
I'm not a fool.

323
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,110
The thoracic surgery department
really wanted me.

324
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,270
I'm so grateful
that you came to work under me.

325
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,430
There may not be many doctors in
our department, but they are the best.

326
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,620
Professor Kim.

327
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,560
Dr. Cha.

328
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,660
Dr. Han.

329
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,720
And, Dr. Park.

330
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,060
Did you call me?

331
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,110
It's nothing.
Eat a lot, this is all for you.

332
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,980
Thank you.

333
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,080
<i>I know it's hard for you to
make the decision.</i>

334
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,810
But, do it for the director,
for your department, and all its doctors.

335
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,790
Excuse me.

336
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,090
I'm sorry, but can you go toward the
Sung Won University Hospital?

337
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,300
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,710
Professor Kim.

339
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,940
Hey, did our guys come here
by any chance?

340
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,530
They already left.

341
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,170
I think they went
to a place nearby for round two.

342
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,330
Where?

343
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,490
Who's next?

344
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,980
- Who? Who?
- Me!

345
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,380
It's me.

346
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,280
Round of applause!

347
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,260
Professor Kim?

348
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,220
I thought you said you weren't coming.
Why did you come?

349
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,270
I wanted to see how much
you were spending on my card.

350
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,910
I spent until I reached the limit.

351
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,630
Yoon Seo.

352
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,450
Why are you calling my name?
It's so awkward.

353
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,900
Tell me honestly.

354
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,530
Do I look clever?

355
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,740
So clever that you are a bit,
just a little bit, cocky.

356
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,410
But, why are you asking me that?

357
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,340
I just wanted to know
how you thought.

358
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,030
From the person I'm closest to.

359
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,110
It's okay if you talk back to me.
It's okay to make trouble.

360
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,630
Just keep trusting in me
the way you do now.

361
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,360
Why are you being like this
so suddenly?

362
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,630
And...

363
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,150
Since I remembered...

364
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,260
Yes.

365
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,470
Can't you stop talking like a soldier?

366
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,730
Are you a soldier?

367
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,860
I've been talking this way for over
10 years, how can I change overnight?

368
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,720
If I tell you to do it, just do it.

369
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,120
It bothers me to hear an old junior
of mine talk like that.

370
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,860
Are you calling me old?

371
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,490
You are speaking so harshly.

372
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,150
Change it.

373
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,110
I'm angry,
so I'm going to change.

374
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,870
You're the one who will
be 40 soon.

375
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,690
When did you grow up so much?

376
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,090
Change it.

377
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,850
Yes, sir.

378
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,800
Kyu Wan, let's do it slowly.

379
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,360
Relax, and start again.

380
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,150
Lee Kyu Wan, if you keep that up,
you'll just be put to shame in Germany.

381
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,380
Focus, and do it again.

382
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,630
Get up.

383
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,740
Get up now!

384
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,910
Kyu Wan.

385
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,790
Kyu Wan!

386
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,500
Kyu Wan, what's wrong?

387
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,730
My throat.

388
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,700
It hurts...

389
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,930
Let's part after our third round.

390
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,230
Do you have any beer?

391
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,010
No.

392
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,960
Then, go and buy some.

393
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,900
Not plastic bottle ones.
Get the glass bottle ones.

394
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,350
Okay.

395
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,500
Beer time!

396
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,830
<i>Yi On, now I know what
that feeling is.</i>

397
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,010
<i>When you used to like
Soon Young from the laundromat.</i>

398
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,840
<i>That feeling.</i>

399
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,890
<i>Please refer me to the best
pediatric surgeons.</i>

400
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,640
They will become candidates
for our hospital's scouting.

401
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720
Feels good.

402
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,800
This is a bad hangover...

403
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,770
Hey, Dr. Park!

404
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,070
Yes.

405
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,870
Are you okay?

406
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,930
Yes, I'm fine.

407
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,180
Nothing's wrong.
I feel good.

408
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,480
Don't drink anymore.
It's a waste of money.

409
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,290
You don't even get drunk.

410
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,400
Smells good, right?

411
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,220
The perfume mixed with soju,
smells like lemon soju.

412
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,890
I want to drink again.

413
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,880
What?

414
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,290
What do you mean Eun Ok's
treatment will be curbed?

415
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,160
I don't think her hospital expenses
have been paid.

416
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,440
Is this woman serious?

417
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,590
Although it's not a forced discharge, it will be
difficult to administer many of the treatments.

418
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,890
Doesn't that lady run a dog farm?

419
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,180
And she doesn't have enough
money for hospital bills?

420
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,700
The Child Protective Agency looked into it.
She's not the owner, just the manager.

421
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,170
- This is driving me crazy.
- Oh, right...

422
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,400
Eun Ok is qualified to receive
benefits for children with disabilities.

423
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,260
I received that, too.

424
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,800
When I was young, I received the
benefits for children with disabilities, too.

425
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,840
The director received it,
and put it into my account.

426
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,360
Then, that money should have been
spent on treating her.

427
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,860
Seriously...

428
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,560
She probably spent all that money on herself.
That woman...

429
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,780
Why don't you ask to be
discharged anymore?

430
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,990
Before, you would have thrown a fit.

431
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,970
Well...

432
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,110
I just feel nervous that
my condition will get bad again.

433
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,900
Good. I feel better if you stay here.

434
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,490
Just wait for a few months.

435
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,760
You'll be able to get a liver transplant.

436
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,850
Can't I just live like this?

437
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,900
It just costs a lot of money.

438
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,340
I told you not to say that!
Again?

439
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
In Hye.

440
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,030
Then, take your medications on time.

441
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,180
I'll be going.

442
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,770
Dr. Han, hurry up.

443
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,790
Dr. Han, why aren't you doing anything?

444
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,370
I think I would just mess up again.

445
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,320
Are you committing a crime?
Why would you be doing something wrong?

446
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,060
That's what I'm saying.

447
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,410
- Don't be surprised. I know everything.
- I told him.

448
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,550
You need people to urge you on.

449
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,120
You're embarrassing me.

450
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,560
When a man makes a dash
at a woman...

451
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,330
he need's a strong impact.

452
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,740
For example...

453
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,530
You should say a comment, first.

454
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,970
'What's your blood-type?'

455
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,460
She'll say, 'Blood type A. Why?'

456
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,820
You say, 'I don't think so.
I think you are blood type A+'

457
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,770
That's so old.
How can you coach him like that?

458
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,970
It's still good.
Very fresh.

459
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,580
Fresh?

460
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,060
Girls want you to recognize
the thing they need the most.

461
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,370
On the dot.

462
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:27,370
What they need the most?

463
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,870
Come in.

464
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,640
What is it?

465
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,950
- What is it?
- It's facial cream.

466
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,330
During Eun Ok's fiasco,
I got to see your bare face.

467
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,410
Senior!

468
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,850
Senior!

469
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,650
Your skin seemed to have
gotten very rough.

470
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,490
What are you saying?

471
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,880
Are you my esthetician?

472
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,560
Why are you concerned about my skin?
How absurd!

473
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,630
- I was just trying to help.
- Whatever!

474
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,780
If you do this again...

475
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,830
What the heck...
I'm so annoyed...

476
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,820
You shouldn't be annoyed.
Just try it.

477
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,270
I heard that you are the best doctor around,
but you seem very young.

478
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,660
I can refer you to an older doctor
if you want.

479
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,430
No.

480
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,800
That wouldn't be good, either.

481
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,250
There is an infection in the throat.
And a possibility for internal abscess.

482
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,840
Did he have similar symptoms
in the past?

483
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,760
Yes.

484
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,870
A few times, he had sores in his throat,
and they were treated with antibiotics.

485
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,850
Maybe because he sings...
He often gets coughs.

486
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,970
Send him to the ER.
Do a blood test, and take a CT.

487
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,120
Yes, sir.
Should we give him antibiotics?

488
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,170
Yes.

489
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,500
Send me the results
as soon as they are ready.

490
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,650
Yes, sir.

491
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,140
Please, hurry.

492
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,560
He can rest today. But, he needs to
go back to practice tomorrow.

493
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,640
When the results are out,
call up Park Shi On, too.

494
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,130
Pardon?

495
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,740
Really?

496
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,840
Professor Kim told you to bring
Park Shi On?

497
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,680
Yes, I don't know why.

498
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,910
It looks like a typical abscess.

499
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,940
But, the location seems
a bit different.

500
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,160
It seems like an abscess to me, as well.

501
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,180
There seems to be an infection
around the thyroid area as well.

502
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,890
Yes.

503
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,190
Most often, doctors will diagnose this
as an abscess or thyroiditis.

504
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,380
But, it's not either.

505
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,700
This is my first time seeing this.

506
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,510
Park Shi On.

507
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,860
Make a diagnosis.

508
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,530
Does the patient get frequent coughs,
a hoarse throat...

509
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,470
or feel pain when trying to swallow?

510
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,740
Yes.

511
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,140
Pyriform sinus fistula.

512
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,980
- What's that?
- Pyrifo what?

513
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,890
So, this is pyriform sinus fistula.

514
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,090
I've only seen this on paper.

515
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,200
This is a third and fourth
branchial cleft anomaly.

516
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,370
It's a rare disease that causes
symptoms like upper respiratory infection

517
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,330
sore throat, and pain the thyroid area.

518
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,300
A simple treatment will cause the
symptoms to recur.

519
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,460
A severe case can lead to thyroiditis.

520
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,860
We can't operate on it like a normal abscess
drainage or other branchial cleft anomaly?

521
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,910
No.

522
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,030
The fistula is located in a more
complicated area.

523
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:28,030
Inflammation can occur in a wide area,
so a nerve may get damaged during the operation.

524
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:31,670
- What other tests are needed?
- Swallowing esophagography.

525
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:37,210
On the CT scan, it seems that the infection
has reached the thyroid, will he be okay?

526
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:43,990
The best way to prevent the recurrence is to
remove the entry to the fistula and sew it up.

527
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,870
It may be necessary to
remove part of the thyroid.

528
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,250
But, that has to be checked
during the surgery.

529
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,750
Because of the location of the fistula...

530
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,470
it's very possible for the upper occipital nerve
to be damaged.

531
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,390
- Then...
- He won't be able to make a high-pitch sound.

532
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,480
He won't be able to sing.

533
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,350
I heard he's famous for singing.

534
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,290
He's going abroad soon.

535
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,670
Park Shi On is the only one of you
that knows about this illness.

536
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,810
A clear diagnosis is necessary
for a successful surgery.

537
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,140
Don't comfort yourselves saying this
is a rare case, be on your toes.

538
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,420
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

539
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,920
Surgery?

540
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,610
My child has to go to Germany
next week.

541
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,210
If he continues to sing, the
pressure on his vocal cords will increase.

542
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,140
And his condition will worsen.

543
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,300
For the child's sake, you should
have the surgery soon.

544
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,780
If he gets the surgery,
when will he be able to sing again?

545
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,290
If he gets the surgery, he will
have trouble making high-pitch sounds.

546
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,410
What?

547
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,500
What do you mean?

548
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,850
Just as I said.

549
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,210
He may not be able to sing.

550
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,790
Listen here!

551
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,470
You'll ruin a child's future,
so you can take an easy way out?

552
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,700
Honey.

553
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,580
If he doesn't get the surgery now,
he'll lose the opportunity.

554
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,590
There's no other treatment
other than surgery?

555
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,640
No.

556
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,940
If you want a complete treatment.

557
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,820
No, thanks.

558
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,050
We'll take him to a hospital abroad.

559
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,100
I can't trust you.

560
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,720
Honey.

561
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,560
Honey!

562
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,190
I'm sorry.

563
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,390
I can understand how she feels,
but that's too much.

564
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,520
It's the guardian's freedom
whether she trusts the doctor or not.

565
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,260
We have to let them be.

566
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,680
Even if we go abroad...

567
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,420
we'll waste our time looking for doctors
and hospitals before we can get him treated.

568
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,970
And his condition will get worse.

569
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,370
Still, I can't get him treated here.

570
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,700
He says there's no option
other than surgery.

571
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,170
If Kyu Wan is in pain...

572
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,600
we need to consider it.

573
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,250
Are you crazy?

574
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,940
Kyu Wan's almost there.

575
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,310
We are talking about
acceptance at the Freude Choir.

576
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,140
Did you forget the hardships
we faced to get here?

577
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,330
We sacrificed everything!

578
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,280
I know we went through hardships,
but we need to think about Kyu Wan.

579
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,650
Kyu Wan's done nothing but sing
since he was four years old.

580
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,960
This is the only thing
that he has.

581
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,180
Let's get him hospitalized, first.

582
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,730
We won't get the surgery immediately.

583
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,660
Let's keep an eye on him as he
gets the treatment.

584
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,430
They don't want a surgery,
so start with the antibiotics.

585
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,060
But, what if they reject surgery
until the end?

586
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,030
We have to convince them.

587
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,200
If he leaves after just getting treated,
it will recur in another month.

588
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,640
Professor Kim...

589
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,120
Thank you for letting Dr. Park
share his knowledge.

590
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,080
I was just checking
his abilities for the last time.

591
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,170
Last time?

592
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,630
I'm going to send Park Shi On
to a diagnostic medical center.

593
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,360
Excuse me?

594
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,350
He'll be better there.

595
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,900
And he won't have to perform
any surgeries.

596
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,040
I suggested other departments
to him as well.

597
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,840
But, he insisted that
he wanted to become a surgeon.

598
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,580
This is an alternate way for
Park Shi On to become a doctor.

599
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,920
But, it will be hard to convince him.

600
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,250
He's lucky that there's even
an alternate way at all.

601
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:19,850
I will look into the diagnostic medical center,
go and convince him.

602
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:35,090
Your dream is to become a surgeon, right?

603
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,170
Not just a regular doctor.

604
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,340
Yes, I want to become a surgeon.

605
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:47,250
Remember when Professor Kim said that
a clear diagnosis is necessary

606
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,330
for a successful surgery?

607
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:50,790
Yes.

608
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,010
Making a diagnosis is very important.

609
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:00,250
I think you would be better
in that field.

610
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,800
Better than anyone else.

611
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,560
Are you trying to convince me again
to give up on becoming a surgeon?

612
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,590
It's not like that.

613
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:13,650
I'm just trying to advise you
as your senior.

614
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,730
I'm not trying to upset you.

615
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,740
A dream is not the same as
your talents.

616
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,670
I'm the best at drawing.

617
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,050
I have confidence in that
more than surgery.

618
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,000
Your dream is something you want to
achieve, even if you are not good at it.

619
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900
You think about your dream when you are
eating, and even when you are sleeping.

620
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,310
My dream is what makes me feel good.

621
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:42,640
Park Shi On.

622
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,200
Park Shi On!

623
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,950
Don't get mad.
I was just asking.

624
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,580
I've never seen you so mad.

625
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,000
You can be in charge of Kyu Wan.

626
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:04,460
I'll tell Professor Kim.
I don't think he'll be against it.

627
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,040
Let's go.

628
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,450
Hello Kyu Wan.

629
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:27,080
I'm your doctor, Park Shi On.

630
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,990
Nice to meet you.

631
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,110
Are you listening to music?

632
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,520
What music are you listening to?

633
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,310
I heard you singing.

634
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:39,430
It was very nice.

635
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,390
You don't want to talk?

636
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,430
Oh my, if it isn't the famous man.

637
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,310
Nice to meet you.

638
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,940
If you are uncomfortable,
let me know.

639
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,450
Here's some water.

640
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,080
When you are done,
you can come to the cafeteria.

641
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:03,920
He doesn't drink that kind of water.

642
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,340
We'll take care of Kyu Wan's
food and water.

643
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,270
The doctors and nurses should limit
their visits to checkups and treatments.

644
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:18,300
Does Kyu Wan only know how to sing,
and not talk?

645
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,050
Excuse me?

646
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,560
If he can't talk,
the kids will call him stupid.

647
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,760
What?

648
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,170
What is he?
Some celebrity?

649
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,140
The child and the adult alike
are so bitter...

650
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,120
Where do you think you are
complaining about a patient and guardian?

651
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,930
I'm sorry, but they are so...

652
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,180
Nurse Nam.

653
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:48,620
What?

654
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,900
Your cheeks.

655
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,140
What about them?

656
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,890
What did you put on?

657
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,490
It's whipped cream.

658
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,060
I was drinking a latte before.

659
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,540
Latte?
Whipped cream?

660
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,870
She used it.

661
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,350
She did...

662
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,060
Did you read over everything
I gave you?

663
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,110
- Vice President.
- Yes.

664
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,040
Is this why you came to our hospital?

665
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,610
I did.

666
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:40,240
Do you really think this will help our hospital
and the pediatrics surgery department?

667
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,570
I already told you my opinion.

668
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:43,980
Vice President!

669
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,270
Yes.

670
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,870
You judged me wrong.

671
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,270
You thought I would agree
to this nonsense?

672
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,330
You must be mistaken...

673
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:00,510
Leave the hospital
within this week.

674
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,350
If you leave on your own,
I won't cause any trouble.

675
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:09,890
But... if you stay, I will file for your
dismissal to the board.

676
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,300
Is the vice president really on our side?

677
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,650
I really can't trust him anymore.

678
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,860
I feel the same way.

679
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,880
I think he's on the chairwoman
and the director's side.

680
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,470
How dare he!

681
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,200
I'm the one who brought him here.

682
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,720
What do we do now?

683
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,670
I think we've used up every method.

684
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,800
There's one more...

685
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,050
What's that?

686
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,310
I'll take care of you.

687
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:46,010
- You just need to make one sacrifice.
- What?

688
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,170
What sacrifice?

689
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,220
- Hurry.
- You go.

690
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,740
You should go.

691
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:05,260
Why did you push me?

692
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:10,710
We are in first grade.
You are in fourth grade, right?

693
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:16,080
We saw you on the blog.
You came out on TV, too, right?

694
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,920
Your songs are the best.
I thought it was a British person singing.

695
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,880
I copied you, but they said I
sounded like a pig howling.

696
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,090
That's right.

697
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,580
But, why are you here?

698
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,770
You're not here to get circumcised,
are you?

699
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,770
You dummy! They don't do that in the
pediatrics surgery department.

700
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,710
They might...

701
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:50,160
I heard you got invited by a famous
chorus in Germany.

702
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,780
You are so lucky.

703
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,620
I heard their sausage is the best.

704
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,070
They have huge ones.

705
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,390
I want your autograph.

706
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,340
When you become more famous,
I'm going to show it off.

707
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,760
What are you guys doing here?

708
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,080
Who told you to come in here?

709
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,760
We just walk around as we wish.

710
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,430
- Right?
- Yeah.

711
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,720
Not here.

712
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,470
Don't ever come in here.

713
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,280
Kyu Wan has to rest up,
and he needs to study, too.

714
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:30,890
Get out.

715
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,700
Hurry, and get out.

716
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,350
Excuse me.

717
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:49,980
Yes?

718
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,480
He needs friends.

719
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,300
He won't hurt as much then.

720
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,500
What?

721
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,490
Talking in a soft voice
won't strain his throat.

722
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,910
He needs to talk and laugh
to get healthy.

723
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,300
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

724
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,980
It's not nonsense.

725
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:08,210
When I was young, I was sick
because I couldn't talk or laugh.

726
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,040
I was sick everyday.

727
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:27,500
Dr. Park, I heard you paid for
Eun Ok's hospital bills.

728
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:34,240
The description they gave me at the
billing department was yours.

729
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,500
I know how you feel.

730
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,720
I felt that way once, too.

731
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,030
But that kind of generosity
will never stop once you begin.

732
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,770
You need to live, too.

733
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,310
I have a lot of money.
I have more than a million won.

734
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:03,000
And I paid with the benefits I received
that I had saved up.

735
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,480
You didn't use any of that?

736
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,640
No.

737
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,200
The director gave me allowance and
he treated me, so I didn't need it.

738
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,510
In a month, I only need enough money for
40 triangular rolls and sandwiches

739
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:19,270
and money to refill the bus card.

740
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,420
Still...

741
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,860
I'm fine.

742
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,090
I want to help people
in worse situations than me.

743
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,180
You are an adult.

744
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,750
You are a true adult.

745
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:34,800
Of course.

746
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,600
He's much more of an
adult than me.

747
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,290
<i>[There is no media.]</i>

748
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,660
Oh, right!

749
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,120
Shi On.

750
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,600
Hello.

751
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,850
What's that pot?

752
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,730
A few days ago, the cafeteria lady
made me some potato soup.

753
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:24,980
Potato soup?

754
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:28,640
That's not on the menu here.

755
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:34,120
According to Dr. Cha, she said
the lady made it just for me.

756
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,060
That's why I'm on my way to return the pot
after finishing the soup.

757
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:39,970
It was really delicious.

758
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,720
Zucchini, red pepper, green pepper,
sesame seed, and the texture of the potatoes.

759
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,500
It tasted just like the one
I used to eat in Tae Back.

760
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,700
Yes.

761
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,710
I remember that taste, too.

762
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,690
- Go, and give it to her.
- Okay.

763
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,910
Madame.

764
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,800
Doctor Park.

765
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,270
Thank you.

766
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,390
I'm sorry for returning this so late.

767
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,590
It's fine.
You're busy.

768
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,480
If you want to eat this again,
tell me anytime.

769
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,990
Can I really do that?

770
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,400
Of course.
Whenever.

771
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,320
Director.

772
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,230
What's this about?

773
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,320
We received a complaint that the
pediatrics surgery department

774
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,870
used the prohibited medicine, Heta Vizen.

775
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,690
That's why we are here
to investigate.

776
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,280
Director...

777
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,880
- What are you doing?
- They came from the Food and Drug Administration.

778
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,160
We are investigating the use of a
prohibited drug. Please cooperate.

779
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,240
Prohibited drug?

780
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,570
Yes, Dr. Park.

781
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,920
What's wrong with Kyu Wan?

782
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,960
He's having chronic pain in the throat.

783
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,780
The pain will get worse because the
soft tissues are expanding due to the infection.

784
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:38,040
We need to hurry and have the surgery.

785
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,340
Be quiet!

786
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,990
Why isn't the doctor coming?

787
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,300
How's his condition?

788
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,870
The left side of the neck is swollen.
His temperature is 39.2 degrees.

789
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,910
His throat is hoarse,
so he can't talk.

790
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,730
The pain started an hour ago.

791
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,000
The antibiotics must not be working.

792
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,700
Move him to the operating room.

793
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,990
Wait!

794
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,700
Let's talk.

795
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,120
I told you that the surgery is
not an option.

796
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,300
It's a simple operation to
drain the abscess.

797
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,540
You say that, but what if my child
can't sing again?

798
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,310
Who do you think we are?

799
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,880
We can't have the surgery without
your consent.

800
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,480
If I upset you,
I'm sorry.

801
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,890
Please prescribe a different antibiotic.

802
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,550
The child is in pain.

803
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,260
Even if we have the surgery,
it won't be here.

804
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:57,010
So, please just let the pain die down.

805
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,800
I understand.

806
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,270
Dr. Park, give him the ibuprofen.

807
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,380
What are you doing?

808
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,050
You are too much.

809
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,980
I thought that all mothers
love their children.

810
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:15,760
But, you don't love Kyu Wan.

811
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,780
You are just like
Eun Ok's aunt.

812
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,140
What is he saying?

813
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,510
How long has it been
since we've been off?

814
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:30,610
Hey, why is it so hard to
see sunlight?

815
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,030
We'll become vampires like this
due to lack of vitamin D.

816
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,210
Look at my complexion.
I look horrible.

817
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:43,940
Let's watch the situation this weekend,
and go hang out at a club.

818
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,430
I want to go, too.

819
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,960
No, thank you. What if you
ruin the atmosphere at the club?

820
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,360
You should look in the mirror
before saying that.

821
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,830
What?

822
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:57,280
What if you get caught?

823
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,510
You want to get in trouble with
the professor?

824
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:02,920
Such a coward...
We won't get caught!

825
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,510
Just let the music take over.

826
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,570
Bounce.

827
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,020
Bounce.

828
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,060
What's this?

829
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:16,360
See?
This is a sign from the heavens.

830
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,600
The earphones fell from the heavens.

831
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:21,810
Wait...

832
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,390
Where did this fall from?

833
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,280
Kyu Wan!

834
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,370
Kyu Wan!

835
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,960
Don't come near!

836
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,500
Kyu Wan, come down and let's talk.

837
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,180
Kyu Wan, why are you doing this?

838
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,540
I told you not to come.

839
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,730
No!

840
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:45,950
Subtitles by DramaFever

841
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:58,740
Everybody tells me
not to become a doctor.

842
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,660
Don't fall like me.

843
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,600
You need to keep trying,
until you get it.

844
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,410
Go there once you are finished
with Kyu Wan.

845
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:10,190
Professor Kim's not doing that because
he dislikes you.

846
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,970
No, he's sending me there
because he hates me.

847
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:17,070
You know what I hate the most, right?
Mistake, excuses, and lies.

848
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,690
Are you having a difficult time like me?
