2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,140
Kim Do Han!

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,470
I told you not to act all arrogant.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,980
What are you talking about?
Let me go.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,320
After I warned you, you dared to take
my patient without permission?

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,060
What?

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,220
That's a misunderstanding.
I haven't gone back...

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,050
Shut up!

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,110
I really don't know
what you are talking about.

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,500
Who took your patient?

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,140
A male resident
from the pediatrics department.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,570
That's what the patient's
parents said.

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,540
If it's a resident from the
pediatrics department...

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,610
It must be one of you.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,910
It was me.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,330
The baby can live.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,280
Not the HPB department, but the
pediatrics department can save the baby.

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,870
And I told them that Dr. Kim Do Han
would perform the operation.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,570
Park Shi On!

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,240
You've taught him well.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,500
You want me to believe that this resident
went on his own to make that decision?

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,740
I did it.
Professor Kim Do Han didn't...

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,030
Kim Do Han.

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,950
Are you looking down on me,
like you look down on your manager?

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,490
Do the pediatricians try to
make money off children?

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,500
You're trying to lure customers
as doctors?

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,290
I understand that you're angry,
but you shouldn't be demeaning us.

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,170
Be quiet, Cha Yoon Seo.

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,650
If you don't want me to demean you,
act right.

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,450
Kim Do Han.

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,560
You better take care of this.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,280
Otherwise, the hospital will
make you pay for this.

33
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,800
Let's say the last time, Sung Ho had
noticeable symptoms.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,060
What made you say that
you could save this preemie?

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,510
You better say something!

36
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:41,510
Since the HPB department won't
perform the surgery, we have to do it.

37
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,360
That's the reason?

38
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,880
Yes.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,510
Do you think you make any sense?

40
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,380
Excuse me.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,130
We are here to see Dr. Kim Do Han.

42
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,620
They are the premature baby's parents.

43
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,610
What do you mean you can't
perform the surgery?

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,230
Professor Kim Jae Joon is one of
the nation's top doctors.

45
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,150
My decision won't be much
different from his.

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,870
But, the doctor outside said
our baby can live.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,800
He's still going through training.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,610
He must have made a mistake
because he empathized with you so much.

49
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,950
It's all my fault.

50
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,160
Please forgive me.

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,720
How can you do this?

52
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,210
How can you take away
our last hope?

53
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,530
What do you think you are doing?

54
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,570
Hey!

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,470
If you can't help us out,
at least, don't make a mess.

56
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,730
I don't care if you make a
fool of yourself...

57
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,000
but why are you making a fool out of
our professor?

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,870
I know.
I was so embarrassed, too.

59
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,190
You're going to ruin our
whole department.

60
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,470
Why did you do that?

61
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,600
You can't do this to us.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,590
There's no use.
Let's go.

63
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,510
What are you doing?
You're not going to make your rounds?

64
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,490
Okay.

65
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,180
You must be suffering so much.

66
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,210
Be strong.

67
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,980
Be strong for just a bit longer.

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,710
What do we do now?

69
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,740
Should we go to another hospital?

70
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,930
This is the best hospital
in our nation.

71
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,120
Where else would we go?

72
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,440
Still...

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,250
We need to do something.

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,480
After all we went through
to have this baby.

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:12,780
As soon as he was born,
I never even got to breastfeed him.

76
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,670
I never got to embrace him.

77
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,550
I never got to change his diaper.

78
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,790
Just once.

79
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,850
Even if it's just once,
I want to do those things.

80
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,280
That's what mothers do.

81
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,460
I've returned the patient.

82
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,570
I'm sorry for everything.

83
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,600
If this happens again,
what will you do?

84
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,960
It won't happen again.

85
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,820
Let me ask you one thing.

86
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,230
Why are you staying in
the pediatrics department?

87
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,150
Because of the director?

88
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,860
I don't think this is the place
to tell you that reason.

89
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,220
The pediatrics department is barely
sustaining itself with the help of a respirator.

90
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,080
If you change your mind after the respirator
comes off, it will be too late.

91
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,790
If you come back before
it's too late...

92
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,870
I can guarantee you a position as
an assistant professor.

93
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,770
I'll be going then.

94
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,140
Hello.

95
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,600
<i>Park Shi On only thinks about
curing the patient.</i>

96
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,400
That's not based on a reasonable decision
or assurance.

97
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,380
It's just a robotic response
from training.

98
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,630
The Park Shi On that I observed
for two days was a robot.

99
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,120
A robot programmed just to
cure the patient, no matter what.

100
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,630
You still don't get it?
Why do you keep looking at the baby?

101
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,980
Don't make this hard.

102
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,490
You have no common sense.

103
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,710
The baby's condition is not improving.
He needs surgery...

104
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,740
Hey!

105
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,070
You're seriously so stupid.

106
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,860
What the heck is wrong with you?

107
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,550
What are you two doing?

108
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,470
Are you trying to rob him?

109
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,560
Should I give you 50 cents each?

110
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not that.

111
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,700
They've already made the decision.

112
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,350
Yeah, so what?
He can't even look?

113
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,250
You can't look at any patients in the NICU
if it's not your own patient?

114
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,460
Who do you think you are
treating him like that?

115
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,640
And he's one of my guys.

116
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,290
You want to die?

117
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,240
Follow me, Dr. Park.

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,880
What?

119
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,370
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

120
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,920
And if I did?

121
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,620
You think you could have
taken care of it?

122
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:42,100
If you don't have any skills, you should
at least have a firm grip on your guys.

123
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,660
I'm saying this for your sake.

124
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,020
Why don't you just go back to
one of the branch hospitals?

125
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,680
That way you won't have to put up with
this, and shame your colleagues.

126
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,300
It'll be for the best.

127
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,180
Park Shi On.

128
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,480
What's a doctor to you?

129
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,800
Hippocratic Oath.

130
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,730
As a physician, my foremost duty is to care
for my patients' health, and save their lives.

131
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,540
Doctors are people who think about the
patient's health and life, first and foremost.

132
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,190
Then what is a patient to you?

133
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,210
A patient is someone who
needs a doctor's help.

134
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,430
If someone needs help,
you need to treat him, no matter what.

135
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,880
How did you come to think
that way?

136
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,080
Hippocrates and Director Choi Woo Suk
both said so.

137
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,240
Other than what the director said...

138
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,730
Do you have any thoughts of your own
about the profession?

139
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,470
When sick people need help,
no matter what...

140
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,840
Never mind.

141
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,390
I got it.

142
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,100
The troubles you caused
in the past few days...

143
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,630
I took them well.

144
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,380
It was a headache, but I still liked you.

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,240
You reminded me of a time when
I was full of passion.

146
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,120
I felt proud to have you join us.

147
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,770
But, thinking about it again...

148
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't think you have any thoughts
of your own when you work.

149
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,900
A doctor without a soul
is like a robot in an operating room.

150
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,450
You must have your own thoughts
and assertions.

151
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,240
Before you think about
treating and curing patients.

152
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,450
Okay?

153
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,480
Why didn't you tell me anything?

154
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,940
Not only did you disrespect me, but
all your superiors and the entire hospital!

155
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,360
Then is it okay to disregard
basic ethics?

156
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,290
If that weren't the case, you wouldn't have
used a harmful medicine like Heta Vizen.

157
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,250
I have plans.
I have to go.

158
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,080
Professor Kim.

159
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,950
I know well that you don't respect me.

160
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,170
But, inside the hospital...

161
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,870
can't you just pretend that you do?

162
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,650
Like this?

163
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,180
Listen carefully to what I say.

164
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,790
From now on, if Park Shi On or Professor Kim
causes any trouble, report to me.

165
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,800
What?

166
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
And...

167
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,910
Do whatever I order you to
from now on.

168
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,650
What?

169
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,760
You don't want to?

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
It's not that.

171
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,900
Who's the one who brought you
all the way here?

172
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,950
Think well.

173
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,980
I thought you two would be busy,
so I came myself.

174
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,260
If you are going to talk about marriage,
I want to cancel my order.

175
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,790
I have no appetite.

176
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,820
Chae Kyung.

177
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,720
I won't talk about that.

178
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,210
I shouldn't if I want you to eat.

179
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,490
Thank you.

180
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,720
The two of you should go to the States.

181
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,610
Professor Kim, you can go to the Boston
Children's Hospital as an exchange doctor.

182
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,870
Chae Kyung, you can start a division
for our foundation there.

183
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,770
But, I don't have anyone to take over
my position at the hospital.

184
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,330
Don't worry about that.
The director and I will take care of it.

185
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,290
Chairman, I can see through you.

186
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,550
You want us to naturally get together
in the U.S.

187
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,750
And...

188
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,320
you want to get rid of the disagreeable
head manager at the Planning Department.

189
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,110
That's not what she meant.

190
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,920
Yes.

191
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,790
I didn't say that to get you upset.
You don't know that?

192
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,440
There's something you're mistaken about.

193
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm not angry because
you're talking about my marriage...

194
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,270
I'm angry because you're
trying to get involved in my life.

195
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,730
Please, keep your distance from me.

196
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,670
I'll be going then.

197
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,320
Even if you don't respect her as a mother,
you should respect her as an elder.

198
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm doing the best I can.

199
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,480
Chae Kyung.

200
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,860
Should we just get married?

201
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,020
I don't like this kind of proposal.

202
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,370
I want your earnestness.

203
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,380
That's all I want...
I don't care about marriage.

204
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,360
Really?

205
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,970
Oh my...

206
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,320
Professor Kim Jae Joon
totally stirred up everything!

207
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,470
How is it that not a single day goes by
without trouble since Dr. Park's arrival?

208
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,470
Again...
You are gossiping again.

209
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,330
We're not gossiping.
We're talking about our department.

210
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,130
I know you're talking about
Dr. Park Shi On.

211
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,850
What do you mean he's causing
all kinds of trouble here?

212
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,560
There's trouble everywhere.
Tsunamis and hurricanes all over.

213
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,940
Just go clean up.

214
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,730
You better watch it.

215
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,120
Why are they dragging him
over like that?

216
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,840
Don't even think about going over to
the NICU. Stay here.

217
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,440
Check on the patients thoroughly.

218
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,830
Just stay here.
Got it?

219
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,460
If he stays here,
who will answer the ER calls?

220
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,140
We've been receiving ER calls all along.
Professor Kim doesn't want Dr. Park doing that.

221
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,400
I was so happy that a new resident
was coming in.

222
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,020
You're a serious threat to my
profession.

223
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,600
Seriously...

224
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,450
Mom...

225
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,460
I don't want to eat it.

226
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,670
He's driving me crazy.

227
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,860
He's not listening again?

228
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,020
No. He won't eat.

229
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,300
What do I do?

230
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,030
Mother, he's really something else,
right?

231
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,190
Can you yell at him?

232
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,640
Dr. Park Shi On,
why don't you go?

233
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,730
Okay.

234
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,010
Seo Joon!

235
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,980
I don't want this.
I want pizza!

236
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,060
I told you that you can't have pizza.

237
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,520
Didn't you hear what the doctor
said yesterday?

238
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,210
Seo Joon, you can't digest well.
You can't eat food made from flour, yet.

239
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,540
Is this the plastic model
FS version?

240
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,770
How do you know that?

241
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,680
This is great.
Where did you buy this?

242
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,920
My dad brought it for me
from Japan.

243
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,750
You're so lucky.

244
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,280
Then, do you have the plastic model
FS version II?

245
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,500
Of course. I even have the
custom made HG limited edition.

246
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,740
You're seriously so lucky.

247
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,090
You're the first one who knows
all the series.

248
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,540
Can I borrow this just for a day?

249
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,900
No.

250
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,770
Just for one day.

251
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,190
I'll just look at it,
and bring it back tomorrow.

252
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,490
No.
Don't touch it.

253
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,460
I'll just look at it.
Really...

254
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,980
Mom, he's trying to steal
that from me.

255
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,350
I'm not stealing it.
I just want to borrow it.

256
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,370
What do we do?

257
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,660
Dr. Park, please stop.
Please have him eat.

258
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,140
If you keep crying,
I'm going to break this.

259
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,990
Don't do that.

260
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,580
Stop.

261
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,610
So...

262
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,630
He caused all that trouble
without Kim Do Han's permission?

263
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,210
Yes, but Kim Jae Joon thinks that
Do Han is behind this.

264
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,520
You should have let the
patient stay!

265
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,970
If something went wrong,
we could have kicked them both out.

266
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,550
I know.

267
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,070
There's no hope in that patient.

268
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,700
We keep getting chances.

269
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,040
But, nothing's working out.

270
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Using the baseball analogy...

271
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,470
There are too many runners
on the base.

272
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,590
If you have more runners on the base,
you are more likely to lose.

273
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,020
Then, what should we do?

274
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,620
We don't have enough to
create a problem.

275
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,740
Are you sure that it will be hard
to save that premature baby?

276
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,060
Yes.

277
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,300
No matter where he goes in the world,
it will be hard.

278
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,150
You have a good idea?

279
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,170
We should bring them to
self-destruction.

280
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,000
And the best way to do that
is to find a definite error.

281
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,650
Thinking about it in baseball terms...

282
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,790
Do you know anyone who
can work for us?

283
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
I'm so tired after trying to
calm him down for two hours.

284
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,390
I thought he would be okay
if he's good enough to be a resident.

285
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,300
But, I guess he has problems.

286
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,780
I knew it didn't make any sense
that an autistic person could be a doctor.

287
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,570
Why did the hospital choose
someone like that?

288
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:26,510
Even big corporations have special hiring
of handicapped people to rehabilitate them.

289
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,860
A hospital shouldn't do that.
It's a place of life and death.

290
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,580
I found out he's not even a
graduate of Seo Kang University.

291
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,850
He went to some college in the countryside.

292
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,350
Are you serious?

293
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,800
And he even goes home at a regular hour.
What kind of a resident is that?

294
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,500
But, he saved my Sung Ho.

295
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,950
It's not like he operated on him.
It was Dr. Kim Do Han.

296
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,980
We should tell his patients' mothers.
They should think about it.

297
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,550
I'll pluck your hair.

298
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,380
I want to change my child's doctor.
How do I do that?

299
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,990
Who's the doctor in charge?

300
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,120
We all have Dr. Park Shi On.

301
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,380
But, why do you want to switch?

302
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,010
Just do it for us.

303
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,210
Dr. Park is a great doctor, too.

304
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,260
How much skill can he have when
he's just a first year resident?

305
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,860
- Switch him.
- And I heard he's not even normal.

306
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,820
Why aren't you working?

307
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,580
Did you get in trouble again?

308
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,420
No.

309
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,670
Then?

310
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,470
It seems like everyone hates me again.

311
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
But, I'm not sad.

312
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,210
It's always been like that.

313
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,790
But...

314
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,910
A robot in an operating room...

315
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,450
A robot in an operating room?

316
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,920
Never mind.

317
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,420
I'm going in to work.

318
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,030
Park Shi On!

319
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,910
Don't you have to stay at the station?
Where have you been?

320
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,310
Stand tall. It's okay to
make mistakes in your residency.

321
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:07,240
Although it was something major...
Just don't do it in the future.

322
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,760
Doctor!
Hurry!

323
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,130
It's In Hye!

324
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,850
In Hye...

325
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,910
In Hye, what's wrong?

326
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,050
My eyes...

327
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,420
My eyes feel like they're
going to pop out.

328
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,950
- Dr. Park, why don't you examine her?
- Okay.

329
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,450
Where does it hurt?
Let me see.

330
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,630
My eyes.

331
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,320
My eyes...

332
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,850
Can you move your hands?

333
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,280
Welcome to the
pediatrics department!

334
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,370
Doctor.

335
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,960
Doctor?

336
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,870
Was that fun?

337
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,870
It wasn't fun for me at all.
That you were all making fun of me.

338
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,480
Oops...

339
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,380
This isn't what I wanted.

340
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,670
He must have misunderstood.
I'll bring him back.

341
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,290
Hello.

342
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,090
Yes, how have you been?

343
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,240
It's been awhile.

344
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,030
Yes.

345
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,420
Na In Hye, did you cause trouble again?

346
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,430
I didn't do anything.

347
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,980
What do you take me for?

348
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,330
Yes, sir.

349
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,990
<i>Do you have some time?</i>

350
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,350
Yes.

351
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,450
I heard what happened with
the HPB department.

352
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,770
And thank you for not
kicking out Dr. Park.

354
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,470
Professor.

355
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,420
Hearing you say sorry and thank you...

356
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,080
It makes me angry now.

357
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,700
You used to scream at me for
the smallest mistakes.

358
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,120
And you would harshly scold me
if I ever mistreated a patient.

359
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,670
I miss that.

360
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,830
Please answer me honestly.

361
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,130
Why are you so protective of
Park Shi On?

362
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,090
You're doing things that
you once hated.

363
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,990
I told you before.

364
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,450
That he's the student
most dear to you?

365
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,630
No, to you all your students
are the same.

366
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,420
You are wrong.

367
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,100
Shi On is very special to me.

368
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,060
You were always the top
from the beginning.

369
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,510
But, Shi On was always in
the worst situations.

370
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,940
If he was in the same situation
as everyone else...

371
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,560
he may have become a
top surgeon like you.

372
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:09,500
I want to recover Shi On's life.

373
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,290
And why is that significant to you?

374
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,630
Because I'm a doctor.

375
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,320
It's my last wish to heal
someone's life.

376
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Before I die,
it's a wish I want to fulfill.

377
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,840
It's all done.

378
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,040
Take a look.

379
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,840
They look 3-dimensional, right?

380
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,350
If he shows off his telescope again,
you can show him that.

381
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,660
What do you see?

382
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,110
Butterfly.

383
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,130
Tiger flower.

384
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,750
Frog.

385
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,620
Lizard.

386
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,200
Azalea.
Cicada.

387
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,150
Wow, you see all that?

388
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,430
I knew my brother was a genius.
A genius!

389
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,660
Professor.

390
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,790
Promise me something.

391
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,340
What?

392
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,780
You can't step down too easily.
You have to stay.

393
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,130
If you leave too easily...

394
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,740
I will resent you.

395
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,900
Fine.

396
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,440
No!

397
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,440
I won't let you leave.

398
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,610
Me, Kim Do Han!

399
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,790
I won't let you go.

400
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,380
He drank so much.

401
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,600
You were still at the hospital?

402
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,690
Yes, I was preparing
my thesis.

403
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,370
You did?
You should go in.

404
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,510
Director, you don't look fine, either.

405
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,850
I'll take care of Professor Kim.
You should go home.

406
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,930
No, it's okay.
Just go.

407
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,450
No, I can't do that.
I should take care of him.

408
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:52,800
Okay.

409
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,300
Please take care of him.

410
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,450
Seriously, he's completely drunk.

411
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,730
- Please be careful.
- Okay.

412
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,250
You'll be working hard starting tomorrow,
so drink up today.

413
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,170
For the pediatric department!

414
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,900
Cheers!

415
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,060
Drink up.

416
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,240
Your glass is empty.
Here.

417
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,860
This is the perfect time for drinking.

418
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,730
If you need anything,
let me know.

419
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,860
You know...

420
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,390
I...

421
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,610
Don't breathe on me.

422
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,120
You wreak of alcohol.

423
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,530
I...

424
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,340
Since a long time ago...

425
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,470
You...

426
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,450
What?

427
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,050
Do you like simmered food?

428
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,400
Simmered cutlass fish...
Simmered beef...

429
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,960
What are you saying?

430
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,810
Yi On.

431
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,960
Yi On.

432
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,220
Yi On!

433
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,450
Thank you for last night.

434
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,100
It was nothing.

435
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,040
But, you should watch your weight.

436
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,120
You've got quite some fat.

437
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,970
It's because of stress.
I'll be fine if you guys don't cause trouble.

438
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,540
If you blame that on us,
I have nothing to say.

439
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,780
Here.

440
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,640
Take it.

441
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,360
What is it?

442
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,400
Perfume?

443
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,070
You don't have any.

444
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,370
It's not for your sake.
It's for the patients' sense of smell.

445
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,280
And stop drinking so much.

446
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,400
Well... thank you anyway.

447
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,590
You still don't understand?
Didn't you hear what I said?

448
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,090
Do you think this is helping the
baby and our team?

449
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,210
Why do you act as you wish?

450
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,860
I told you to think!

451
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,090
I...

452
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,390
I'm not a robot.

453
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:22,480
You don't tend to the patients
with care, with your heart.

454
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,010
All you have is the desire to
cure them.

455
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,640
That's not true.

456
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,520
I can feel it.

457
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,970
That baby wants to live.

458
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,690
Did you see the baby's hands?

459
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,690
That's a sign that he wants to live.
That he wants to live very badly.

460
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,170
No.
It's just a reflex.

461
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,460
No.

462
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,630
The baby can't talk...

463
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,310
Because he's too young, too sick,
and too scared to talk.

464
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,950
But, he wants to live.

465
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,630
He wants to see his mom.

466
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,500
An inguinal hernia is very common
for boys.

467
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,670
We are performing surgery to prevent
any emergencies like an incarcerated hernia.

468
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,240
But, there aren't any symptoms.
And there's movement in his intestines.

469
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,130
There won't be any problems.
Don't worry too much.

470
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,850
Not right away...

471
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,210
<i>Tell Dr. Kim Do Han
what I just said.</i>

472
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,170
Woo Il Kyu.

473
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,650
Woo Il Kyu!

474
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,770
Yes?

475
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,020
What are you doing?
Put the images up.

476
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,660
I'm sorry.

477
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,280
Professor Kim!

478
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,890
What is it?

479
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,130
I don't know if I should tell you...

480
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,460
What is it?

481
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,760
It's nothing serious.

482
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,120
I overheard some residents from
the HPB department talking at dinner yesterday.

483
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,440
About that premature baby...

484
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,550
They were saying you returned the baby
because you didn't have the ability to treat him.

485
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,100
Professor Kim Jae Joon
must have said that.

486
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:09,350
He even said you didn't want to
take the blame for messing up the surgery.

487
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,270
When I heard that I got so mad.
I was going to start something...

488
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,500
But, I thought I may be over-reacting.

489
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay.

490
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,320
Don't spread any rumors.

491
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,820
I won't.

492
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,040
Give me the chart for the
preemie with the enteritis necroticans.

493
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,030
Professor Kim.

494
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,010
You shouldn't do this.
We are trying hard, too.

495
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,890
I shouldn't do this?

496
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:56,030
Fine, I won't cause you any troubles.
I'll take over this preemie.

497
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,230
What?

498
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:00,150
All you did was drainage,
and you say you did your best?

499
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,850
You don't even try to
help this poor baby.

500
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,850
You still call yourselves surgeons?
Just quit!

501
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,410
You don't even have the basics!

502
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,850
I was wondering why he called.
Why did he change his mind?

503
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,390
I don't know.

504
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,470
You should thank Professor Kim later.

505
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,550
You're not the only one
that wants to save the baby.

506
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,700
Remember that.

507
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,430
This premature baby was born at the
gestational age of 22 weeks and 3 days

508
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,050
weighing 547 grams.

509
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,700
Free air was found in the
X-ray of his abdomen.

510
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,120
Sonography shows enteritis necroticans
in a large portion of his intestines.

511
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,550
Aren't there a lot of variables
that can't be seen by a sonography?

512
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,760
That's right.

513
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,880
You can't tell everything by
solely looking at the sonography.

514
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,960
There's no way to know a patient
completely by running a test.

515
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,450
That's why clinical experience
is the most important.

516
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:03,300
The patient's condition hasn't
improved much after the drainage.

517
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
But since he's still alive,
we should attempt the surgery.

518
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,250
We'll have the surgery as soon
as possible.

519
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,760
- Within the next 24 hours.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,870
But, there's something you
should remember.

521
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,100
The success rate of this surgery
is less than 20 percent.

522
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,580
It looks like there's something
accumulating under the liver.

523
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,300
Although it's minimal, it looks like something
is accumulating around the gall bladder.

524
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:46,000
- You see something?
- It could just be an imaging artifact.

525
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,210
No, when you consider the the baby's
anatomical structure, I am correct.

526
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:53,310
You think you're a 3-D scanner?
How can you tell?

527
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:58,270
Stop. It's possible for a resident to
get confused by imaging artifacts.

528
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,770
What do you think you are doing?

529
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,560
What are you doing?

530
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,100
We are going to perform the surgery.

531
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,550
You...

532
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,570
You're not treating the patient.
You're just neglecting him.

533
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,610
I've never heard that neglect
is a form of treatment.

534
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,640
You.

535
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,510
I warned you before.

536
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,760
The hospital will hold you responsible.

537
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,920
- Yes.
- Be prepared to take full responsibility.

538
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,430
I'll take responsibility, too.

539
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:38,510
But, what are we
taking responsibility for?

540
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,140
Seriously...

541
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:11,960
Do you think this matter is grave enough
to call for a board meeting?

542
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:18,160
According to the hospital rules,
there's no way to avoid this.

543
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,120
Professor Kim Jae Joon is one of the
best doctors in the nation.

544
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,430
We should respect his authority.

545
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:36,350
Then I presume we will have
to discuss my leave as well.

546
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,560
Dr. Park Shi On is the one that
started all this trouble.

547
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,990
I should take the responsibility
along with Dr. Park.

548
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:51,200
Just as I promised everyone
at the board meeting.

549
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,450
Well...

550
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,620
I don't think you have to
worry about that.

551
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:02,470
How can they call a board meeting because
of this? And it's set for tomorrow?

552
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,050
I'm sure they want to take care of it
as soon as possible.

553
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,270
Since the HPB department chief's
pride was damaged.

554
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,260
Then, will we be able to have the
surgery, or not?

555
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,120
If they say we can't, we can't.

556
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,730
Then, what do we do?

557
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:21,360
The baby's condition keeps getting worse.

558
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,690
Park Shi On, this kid...

559
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:24,900
Enough.

560
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,820
Professor Kim is the one
who made the decision.

561
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,130
All we have to do
is follow his orders.

562
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,110
What is it?

563
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,400
Thank you for operating
on the baby.

564
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:56,940
You don't have to thank me.

565
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,640
I'm not doing this for you.

566
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,260
You've done wrong to the
patient and his family.

567
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,330
You gave them unfounded hope.

568
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,440
And that hope brought on
even bigger despair.

569
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,450
A doctor is not a religious leader.

570
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,630
You should never give them
unfounded hope.

571
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:29,460
Because of all this, there's no change
in my opinion that you're the worst doctor.

572
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,600
That's why I won't
let you get kicked out.

573
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,160
Go through your residency and
fellowship, and become a real doctor.

574
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,670
And realize for yourself how much you've
wronged all of your patients.

575
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:50,720
If you realize it then,
quit right away.

576
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
Without any regret...

577
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,400
You're even good at reading
people's psychological tendencies.

578
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,580
Who knew Professor Kim
would fall into our trap so easily?

579
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,550
His pride is indeed his weakness.

580
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,660
He gets out of control
at the slightest provocation.

581
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,760
We've set the trap for an error.
So, we should watch for now.

582
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,870
I will target Park Shi On
at the board meeting.

583
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:34,530
I will push that he's solely
responsible for the trouble.

584
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:38,940
Naturally, the director would step up
to take responsibility.

585
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,110
Good!

586
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,590
I'm sorry,
but I need to get going.

587
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,910
Why?
You should drink some more.

588
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,470
No, I have to take care of
something urgently.

589
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,610
Removed.

590
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,210
Yes.

591
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:03,250
The manager and the cleanup hitter
are perfect. They will both remain.

592
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,700
As long as the general manager changes,
there won't be any problem with rebuilding.

593
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,440
And...

594
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,680
There's a very interesting rookie.

595
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:20,530
First, we should figure out
who is responsible for this damage.

596
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,980
Who's the one that convinced the parents
to go over to the pediatrics department?

597
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,950
Was it Professor Kim Do Han?
Or was it Dr. Park Shi On's own decision?

598
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:33,240
Dr. Park Shi On.

599
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,880
It was me.

600
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,950
- Without permission...
- I did it.

601
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,330
After hearing about the patient's condition
from Dr. Park Shi On...

602
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,200
I made the order.

603
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,460
- No, I told the parents...
- Enough.

604
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,680
From what I know, it was
Dr. Park Shi On's personal decision...

605
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,520
Think reasonably.

606
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,720
Someone in their first year of residency
would not make this kind of decision.

607
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,360
It's not possible.

608
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,760
Then, why did you
change your decision?

609
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,550
Because of the HPB department's
negligence.

610
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,420
They were neglecting the patient.

611
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,420
Neglect? He wasn't going to get better
with any treatment.

612
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,800
If it wasn't neglect,
did you tend to him?

613
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,700
Giving treatment and pushing for surgery
to a hopeless patient...

614
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,320
That's a surgeon's pride
and selfishness.

615
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,520
There's a 20 percent chance of success.
It's not hopeless.

616
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,710
Be quiet!

617
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,760
How dare a resident interrupt!

618
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,240
The reason I didn't opt for surgery
was for the sake of the patient and family.

619
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,460
Because you knew he would die.

620
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,730
Isn't it because you didn't
want to waste time and money?

621
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,490
- What?
- Professor Kim Do Han!

622
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,730
Have some respect for your senior.

623
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,990
Professor Kim Jae Joon, you should
refrain from responding emotionally.

624
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:41,270
In any case, without permission,
Dr. Kim Do Han used the patient's parents

625
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:44,340
to transfer the patient.

626
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,020
This is something that should be
dealt with strictly.

627
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:54,300
Looking at the past examples,
there are two options.

628
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,210
One, he can return the patient
to the original department.

629
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,610
Then, write a written apology,
and receive one month's pay cut.

630
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,780
Two, he will perform the surgery
on the patient.

631
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,470
But, his performance rating will go down
with a three month suspension

632
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,310
and there will be a pay cut.

633
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,080
And his research funding will
be decreased.

634
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:23,930
Professor Kim Do Han,
what will you choose?

635
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:31,550
I will perform the surgery.

636
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:41,730
If the surgery goes wrong, you may
have to take ethical responsibility as well.

637
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,630
- I won't let that happen.
- No!

638
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,280
If something goes wrong,
the hospital may be in trouble.

639
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,680
What is it? Don't you see
that the meeting is in session?

640
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,780
I'm sorry.

641
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,850
Professor Kim,
the preemie’s vitals are unstable.

642
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:04,750
The heart rate dropped below 100,
and oxygen dependency is increasing.

643
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,990
- What about pH level?
- 7.1, metabolic acidosis is increasing.

644
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:12,310
He hasn't been urinating since three hours ago.
His abdomen is bloating up.

645
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,200
He needs the surgery immediately!

646
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:22,170
I'm sorry.
I'll return after the surgery.

647
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,250
We will have to take a recess.

648
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:34,060
Yes, we have no other choice.
I will have to go to NICU, myself.

649
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,170
- Prepare for the surgery now.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,500
I will find out the availability of an
operating room and an anesthesiologist.

651
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,460
- No, prepare for the surgery to take place here.
- Excuse me?

652
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,980
Here? Why?

653
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,320
The preemie’s body surface is too large,
and it's hard to control their body temperature.

654
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,030
It's easy to get hypothermia.

655
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,550
It will be very hard to maintain his
body temperature if we transport him.

656
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,600
It's also dangerous because
the intubation tube is unstable.

657
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,220
Preemies can be put in danger by the smallest
impact. We should operate in this condition.

658
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,010
Call for the anesthesiologist,
and prepare the operating table.

659
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,220
Yes, sir.

660
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,770
Why haven't the tools come up yet?

661
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,460
Dr. Jung, what's taking so long?

662
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,640
The manager won't allow us.

663
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,040
There's high risk for surgeries
away from the operating room.

664
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,320
He says it's worse because
it's a preemie with unstable vitals.

665
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,270
What about the scrub and circulating nurses?
And the tools?

666
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,160
It's impossible to bring the tools to this room.
We may lose them.

667
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,120
But, more importantly, our nurses don't have
experience performing surgery in this room.

668
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,340
This is an emergency.

669
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,770
Still, you have to follow the rules.

670
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,600
What rules when the baby's life
is in danger?

671
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,660
Who will take responsibility if
something goes wrong?

672
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,800
I won't hold you responsible.

673
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,450
If something goes wrong,
I'll be blamed.

674
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,890
Dr. Jung get ready.
Head Nurse, you should bring the tools.

675
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,600
And call for the nurses.

676
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,890
Yes, sir.

677
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,220
We are all set.

678
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,640
Scalpel.

679
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:25,580
The area of damage is larger
than we expected.

680
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:29,240
Check the entire small intestines.

681
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,010
Necrosis is present in almost all parts of the small
intestines, 30 cm below the treitz ligament.

682
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:42,050
Enterobrosia in three spots.

683
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,980
Remove the part with the necrosis.

684
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:48,410
We will make small intestine fistula
using the upper part of the intestine.

685
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,700
Clamp.

686
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,490
Suction.

687
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,340
Gauze.

688
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,950
Clamp.

689
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,950
Scalpel.

690
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,900
We are done removing the necrosis.
Fortunately, the small intestines held up.

691
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,070
This is better than expected.

692
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,760
We will now make the
small intestine fistula.

693
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,360
I'm asking because I don't know.

694
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,870
Is the surgery going well?

695
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,600
It's going beyond well.

696
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,060
In the few cases of surgeries
we have for preemies

697
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,520
this will be a success for the
smallest preemie ever.

698
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,750
Even amongst cases reported by the
Academy of Pediatric Surgery

699
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,850
this will be the most unique case.

700
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:36,320
The small intestine fistula is complete.

701
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,010
- We can close it up.
- No, you can't.

702
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,710
I saw something accumulating
under the liver.

703
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,620
- What are you talking about?
- Are you sure it wasn't an imaging artifact?

704
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:51,110
I saw it clearly.
Clearly.

705
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:55,110
We have to finish the surgery quickly.
The baby went through a lot already.

706
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,620
Wait.

707
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,690
Suction.

708
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:12,850
It's CBD perforation.

709
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,910
The bile seeping out
is creating bile tumors.

710
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:43,670
We need to remove them,
and start the cholangiojejunostomy.

711
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,430
- There's a high risk for infection.
- No, not the cholangiojejunostomy.

712
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,340
What do you mean?
That's the only option we have.

713
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,110
Park Shi On's right.

714
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:01,760
The biliary tract is too thin.

715
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,260
And the small intestine can't reach it.

716
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:08,000
Then...

717
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,040
Do you have another plan?

718
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,730
No.

719

720
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,010
I should take full responsibility.

721
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,130
I have to go.
I have to receive the punishment.

722
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,100
- Then go!
- Apologize.

723
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,860
Can't you even say you're sorry?

724
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,460
Can you stop that?

725
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,200
- In Hye!
- Move out of the way!

726
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,280
Doctor! What does this person do?

727
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,200
That doctor's really strange.

728
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,820
What does it matter if
you learn this all?

729
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,800
No one expects you to be a doctor.

730
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,360
If we leave him alone,
he'll end up killing someone.

731
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,590
A hero with deficiencies is only
possible in comic books.

732
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,100
Park Shi On, what kind of a
person are you?
