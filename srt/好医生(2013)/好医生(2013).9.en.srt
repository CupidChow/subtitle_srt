<i>Episode 9</i>

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,510
Kyu Wan!

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,340
Don't come near!

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,870
Kyu Wan, come down and let's talk.

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,900
Kyu Wan, why are you doing this?

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,870
Don't come near!

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,480
No!

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,310
Kyu Wan...

10
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,840
Please...

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,060
If I get the surgery,
I won't be able to sing again.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,610
I'll never be able to sing again.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,190
No, Kyu Wan.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,260
It's not like that.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,020
No Kyu Wan, your mom's right.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,250
It'll just be a treatment.

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,470
Trust us, and come down.

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,360
Stop lying.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,280
I heard everything!

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,340
Kyu Wan.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,170
Aren't you scared?

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,410
I'm not scared of dying at all.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,290
Not at all!

24
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,870
I...

25
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,870
I'm scared.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,510
If I die, I'll be all alone.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,700
I don't want to be alone.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,690
My bunny and my brother
are in heaven...

29
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,400
but, I don't think I'll be
able to go there.

30
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,410
I've hurt too many people.

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,920
Even if people hate me
and call me stupid...

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,880
I want to be alive.

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,140
At least, I can be around other people.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,180
But Kyu Wan,
a lot of people love you.

35
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,460
I'm envious of you.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,070
So, you shouldn't do this.

37
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,690
If you die, the people who love you
will be very sad.

38
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,170
Because they won't be able to
see you even if they want to.

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,610
I'm still alive
even when everyone hates me.

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,740
You can't die.

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,170
You have a mom and a dad.

42
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,470
I didn't have either
since a long time ago.

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,180
I get scared just standing
at the top of a slide.

44
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,230
Hurry, and come down.
I'm getting dizzy.

45
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,450
Hurry.

46
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,430
Thank you, Kyu Wan.

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,730
Move him to the ER.

48
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,610
Remove the abscess.

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,180
Yes.

50
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,280
Dr. Ko.

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,680
Did you ever administer Heta Vizen
to a patient?

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,020
<i>Just say that you administered it.</i>

53
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,630
<i>And don't forget to add that
the director knew about it.</i>

54
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,850
Who cares if you lose your license?

55
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,530
I...

56
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,270
I will give you a seat
on the board.

57
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,460
Did you administer it or not?

58
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,130
Heta Vizen...

59
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,080
I never administered it.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,590
Then, Professor Kim Do Han.

61
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,650
Did you ever use it?

62
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,650
No.

63
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,470
Then, I'll ask the director.

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,530
Were you aware of any use
of this drug?

65
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,840
Heta Vizen...

66
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,570
I'm the vice president.

67
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,360
- This is how you investigate?
- We are just asking a few questions.

68
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,370
Are you prosecutors?

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Bring us clear evidence first.

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,370
If you keep this up,
we will have to take steps, too.

71
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,760
Kyu Wan, this is not a surgery.

72
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,160
We are just taking the pus
from your neck.

73
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,020
So, don't worry.
Okay?

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Don't worry.
This will be over soon.

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm going to start.

76
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,760
What do you mean?

77
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,520
Kyu Wan wasn't listening to music.

78
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,240
There was nothing in his mp3 player.

79
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,560
Kyu Wan wasn't using the mp3 player
to listen to music.

80
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,040
He didn't want to hear any sound,
so he was using the earphones as plugs.

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,210
I'm sure he didn't want to
listen to music, either.

82
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,450
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

83
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,970
This isn't nonsense.

84
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,580
When I was young, I didn't
want to hear my friends teasing me...

85
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,130
So, I used to plug up my ears, too.

86
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,310
But...

87
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,080
You really won't
let him have the surgery?

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,160
No.

89
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,340
Never.

90
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,220
That's not good...

91
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,470
Not good...

92
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,590
You have to overcome this.

93
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,630
What use would that be?

94
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,100
I've already lost my conscience.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,050
It wasn't your fault.

96
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,720
You did that for Park Shi On.

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,550
That's only an excuse.

98
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,010
I could have used other methods
to keep Shi On here.

99
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,730
I was being too rash.

100
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,570
Let the vice president take care of this.

101
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,580
This is not about your conscience.

102
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,860
Do Han...

103
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,530
I hope you won't fall.

104
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,270
Like this undeserving teacher.

105
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,970
As a mother...

106
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,190
How can she not do anything
even after that happened to her son?

107
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,310
I know...

108
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,420
Other moms would try to
get the surgery done no matter what.

109
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,260
She's gone crazy over that choir.
And she calls herself a mother...

110
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,100
I guess there's Sim Bong who sold his daughter
for a mere 300 sacks of rice.

111
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,940
That's not a small amount.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,150
One sack of rice weighs about
144 kilograms.

113
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,380
300 sacks times 144 kilograms.
That's 43,200 kilograms, or 43.2 tons.

114
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,670
Currently there are 20 kilograms of rice in
one bag. That would mean 2,160 bags.

115
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,080
If we calculate a current bag of rice to
be 40,000 won...

116
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
2,160 times 40,000 won.
That would be 86,400,000 won.

117
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,570
At the market, they were selling
20 kg of rice for 18,000 won.

118
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Oh...
Really?

119
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,910
<i>I could have used other methods
to keep Shi On here.</i>

120
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,010
Did you want to see me?

121
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,440
Tell Shi On to come see me.

122
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,570
Are you going to tell him today?

123
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,260
- Please think about it a little bit more.
- About what?

124
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,810
You saw before...

125
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,000
Dr. Park didn't make any mistakes.

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,990
He's just starting to learn.

127
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,960
There are tens of thousands of decisions that
a surgeon has to make on a moment's notice.

128
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,000
And you want to acknowledge him
because of that one incident?

129
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,120
How long will we have to wait for him
to have the right decision making skills?

130
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,780
One year?
Ten years?

131
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,830
Nobody knows that.

132
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,190
But there is hope.

133
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,530
I'm sending him to another department,
so he doesn't lose that hope.

134
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,930
You scared me...

135
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,500
What the heck?

136
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,980
Would you like some ice cream?

137
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,120
I don't want any, go!

138
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,800
This ice cream divides into two.

139
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,270
Here.

140
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,670
You don't understand what
I'm saying...

141
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,950
Calluses and cuts...

142
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
What?

143
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
There are calluses and cuts
on your hand.

144
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm most envious of hands that
have calluses and cuts on them.

145
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,410
It's a hand that's been through
many surgeries.

146
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,990
You have many more than
Professor Kim or Dr. Cha.

147
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:35,420
I want to become a surgeon soon,
and have calluses and cuts on my hands, too.

148
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,740
That's my dream.

149
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,090
What the heck are you saying?

150
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,030
Stop talking nonsense, and go!

151
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,270
Enjoy.

152
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,230
I'm sure it was Executive Director Lee.

153
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,600
We destroyed all records of the drug use.

154
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,710
Yes.

155
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,650
What about the FDA?

156
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,730
Okay.

157
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,310
I understand.

158
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,820
Thank you.

159
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,910
Why are you just sitting there?

160
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,360
I was thinking about what Park Shi On
said before.

161
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,000
I just feel bad for him.

162
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,510
I don't think I ever really hated him.

163
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,460
- But, he must think that.
- I felt bad, too.

164
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,740
What's wrong with you guys
when you know his condition?

165
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,110
This doesn't have to do
with his condition.

166
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,520
Even animals know
when they are being hated.

167
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,300
Park Shi On doesn't listen
and he may cause troubles...

168
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,030
but, he's not a bad kid.

169
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,440
Hey.

170
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,900
Causing trouble makes you
a bad kid.

171
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,200
It's not like you never caused trouble.

172
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,200
Why's that kid
talking to me like that?

173
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,250
- The issues with the FDA will be settled by today.
- You don't need to tell me.

174
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,540
Don't get involved with
hospital matters anymore.

175
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,420
If you leave because of this,
what will happen to all your hard work?

176
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,340
If I did wrong, I should
take full responsibility, and leave.

177
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:28,530
What about all the students who respect you?
And Dr. Park who thinks of you as his own father?

178
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,620
You'll be hurting all of them.

179
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,860
No.

180
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,020
My leaving will be the last
lesson I teach to my students.

181
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,630
Take the proposal you gave me,
and leave.

182
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,690
If you decline, it will lead to a
bigger problem.

183
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,370
After I see you leave,
I will leave, myself.

184
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,060
After you are done with Kyu Wan,
switch your department.

185
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
To the clinical pathology department.

186
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,680
I already talked to the professor there.

187
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,000
This is my recommendation letter.
Hold onto it.

188
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,600
You're not going to take it?

189
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,930
I don't want to take it.

190
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,980
I'm going to become a pediatrics surgeon.
I'm not going to another department.

191
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,610
Are you rebelling against me?

192
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,590
I'm not rebelling.
I'm just telling you my dream.

193
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,550
Becoming a surgeon is
an unrealistic dream for you.

194
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,510
Becoming a clinical pathologist is realistic.

195
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,540
I don't know about that.
I'm going to become a surgeon.

196
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,270
- You don't understand what I'm saying?
- I know you don't like me.

197
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,460
But I don't care if you hate me more.
Please let me stay here.

198
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,330
Just listen to me!

199
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,030
Did I tell you to give up on
becoming a doctor?

200
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,920
You think surgeons are the only doctors?

201
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm saying this for you,
so listen!

202
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,990
Professor Kim, you should talk to him later.

203
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,100
Park Shi On.

204
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,660
Yes.

205
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,460
Professor Kim's not doing that
because he hates you.

206
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,910
You know that, right?

207
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,350
No, he's sending me away
because he hates me.

208
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,710
Up next is Chopin's Nocturne
Op. 9, No. 2.

209
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,730
Yes.

210
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,010
Shi On.

211
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,810
Listen carefully to what I'm
going to say.

212
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,820
Okay.

213
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,370
You'll be okay at the hospital
even if I'm not around, right?

214
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,950
You can answer me.

215
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,600
Are you going somewhere?

216
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,780
No...

217
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,590
I'm just asking you about the future.

218
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,230
If you are not around,
I'll be very sad.

219
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,700
Very.

220
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,280
Shi On.

221
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,750
You've grown up enough to be okay
even without my help.

222
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,530
No.

223
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm still young.

224
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,600
No.

225
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,480
The way you care for your patients...
You're not young at all.

226
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,090
I learn from you.

227
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
That's why you are an adult.

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:34,610
Whether I stay or not
is not that important to you anymore.

229
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,760
As I was a friend to you...

230
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,970
you need to become a good friend
to the sick children.

231
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,700
Do you understand?

232
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,260
As you said, I'll be a friend to the kids.

233
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,840
But...

234
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,590
I hope that you won't leave me.

235
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,460
If anything hurts, let me know.

236
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,740
I'll make it stop hurting.

237
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,640
Are you upset that
you won't be able to sing?

238
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,900
I'm not upset.

239
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,960
I still want to die.

240
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,380
You see...

241
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,350
All I ever did was sing
since I was four years old.

242
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,740
Before I even started talking...

243
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,490
I didn't go to school,
or meet with friends.

244
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,850
I didn't even play games.

245
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,920
If I can't sing,
then I'm nothing.

246
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,040
I think I understand what you're saying.

247
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,370
I may not be able to become
a doctor, either.

248
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,500
People tell me not to become a doctor.

249
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,360
Why?

250
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,890
I'm different from other people.

251
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,850
I'm kind of stupid because of that.

252
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,560
I can't understand well
what others are saying...

253
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,040
I cause trouble...

254
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,770
Still, you have hope.

255
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,090
Hope?

256
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,250
Even if people tell you not to become
a doctor, you can continue to try.

257
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,100
Until you become one.

258
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,580
Until I become one?

259
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,550
Yes.

260
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,650
Until you become one.

261
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,620
But...

262
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,520
I can't even try
if I get the surgery done.

263
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,650
I want him to get discharged
tomorrow morning.

264
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,280
Kyu Wan's condition is much worse
than how it appears on the outside.

265
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,350
All we did was remove the pus to get the
swelling down. It's still infected inside.

266
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,910
- We need to depart next week.
- The long flight might worsen his condition.

267
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,830
There are hospitals in Germany.
He can get the treatment there.

268
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,640
That's not the only problem.
He tried to commit suicide.

269
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,200
He needs psychological rest.
He needs professional help.

270
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,890
That will never happen again.

271
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,850
I will give him psychological rest.

272
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,730
If you have nothing else to say,
I'm leaving.

273
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,970
Wait!

274
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,470
You won't get him the surgery
even in Germany, right?

275
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,250
And you said you would give
him psychological rest.

276
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,040
How will you do that when your
priority is not his health?

277
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,060
Is it a doctor's job to interfere
with a parent's child rearing?

278
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,150
I'm not getting involved in your child rearing.
I'm just worrying about his health.

279
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,810
Go to the pediatrics ward,
and take a look at other mothers.

280
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,670
They can't even bear to watch
their children get injections.

281
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,650
You must not be married.

282
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,870
Every household has a different
way of loving their child.

283
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,320
In any case...

284
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,270
you can't take him without the
doctor's permission.

285
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,780
Do as you wish.

286
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,420
If I take him, that's the end.

287
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,750
Yes.

288
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,020
We have a five year old boy in the ER
injured from a car accident.

289
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,830
Hemoperitoneum is suspected,
and he has extremely low blood pressure.

290
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,040
The blood pressure isn't rising.
The blood transfusion is not enough.

291
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,110
Just continue.

292
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,430
- I'll raise RBC, FFP, and PC.
- Okay.

293
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,310
The spleen is badly damaged.
It will be hard to salvage it.

294
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,260
Tie up the splenic artery first.

295
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,460
Mixter.

296
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,770
Metzenbaum.

297
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,520
Tie.

298
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,760
Cut.

299
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,570
The blood pressure is rising.
We got the vitals.

300
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,360
- Dr. Cha, you take care of the rest.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,890
Forceps.

302
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,050
Why are you out here?

303
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,900
Mom doesn't know.

304
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,570
My dream...

305
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,510
Whether it's my real dream.

306
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,380
Then, do you have a different dream?

307
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,960
My dream is not to
become part of a famous choir.

308
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,050
Just as doctors heal
sick people.

309
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,100
I want to heal people's hearts
with my song.

310
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,050
That's such a cool dream.

311
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,980
That's a really cool dream.

312
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,960
Going to Germany...

313
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,410
Wearing beautiful robes...

314
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,290
And singing in grand halls...

315
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,890
I don't care about that.

316
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:31,410
I want to sing to the people
who really need my songs.

317
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,610
Her name is Lee Eun Ok.
She's two years younger than you.

318
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,350
Eun Ok doesn't have a mom.

319
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:02,220
So, she thinks about her mom in heaven
while listening to your songs.

320
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,920
She really can't speak?

321
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,640
No.

322
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,370
But, she's gotten a lot better.

323
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,930
Just a while ago,
she was really like a dog.

324
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,930
Looking at her expressions,
I think she likes you better than me.

325
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,950
She likes holding your hand
better than listening to your songs.

326
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,790
Eun Ok.

327
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Say, 'Oppa.'
(Big Brother/Friend)

328
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,800
'Oppa.'

329
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,010
Good job.

330
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,160
Good job, Eun Ok.

331
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,450
Dr. Park, may I see you?

332
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,250
She gave up the guardianship?

333
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,120
Eun Ok's aunt gave up her guardianship.

334
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,730
We got a call from
the management office.

335
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,410
They wanted to know what we
are going to do about Eun Ok.

336
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,450
Then, Eun Ok is an orphan?

337
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,830
Yes.

338
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,530
How can she do that?

339
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
That's not good.

340
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,940
She can't do that.

341
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,660
Are you okay?

342
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm fine.

343
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,930
You know what I hate the most, right?

344
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,610
Mistakes, excuses...

345
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,140
And lies.

346
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,570
I never lied to you.

347
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,900
Sitting here alone means that
you are lying.

348
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,790
Seriously...

349
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,410
Can't you just let it pass once?

350
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,040
If I let it pass?

351
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,850
What if you get caught by the kids?

352
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,730
How do you think I was when I lost
the first patient during surgery?

353
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,680
Probably as I imagine.

354
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,350
Without any feelings...
Logical and cold.

355
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,990
Yeah.

356
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,320
I thought that death was just
part of a doctor's duty.

357
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,320
But, I couldn't eat or drink anything
other than water for a week.

358
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,310
I don't know the reason.

359
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,430
And, this is the first time
I'm telling anyone about that time.

360
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,000
You're eating well, right?

361
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,120
Then, that's fine.

362
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,980
You are better than me.

363
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,870
I won't tell you to get over it.

364
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,200
Just struggle a little bit,
and come back.

365
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,080
Yes, sir. I'll be quick
to regain my mental health.

366
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,040
Really?

367
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
Then you should perform the surgery
next week for Jung Min.

368
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,290
What?

369
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,690
You were being so nice...
Why are you doing this?

370
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,240
Stop complaining.
This will be your first official surgery.

371
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,400
The first two were temporary.

372
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,440
If you are unhappy, then you
should become a professor, too.

373
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,700
I heard about her guardianship problem.

374
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,780
Let's find a way.

375
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,290
We can put our minds together.

376
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:01,980
If Eun Ok goes to an orphanage, the other
kids will hate her because she can't talk or play.

377
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,380
Like me.

378
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,850
Do you really think that everyone
will hate you?

379
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:11,710
I didn't know before, but now
I think I know how it feels to be mad.

380
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,890
I get mad that people hate me.

381
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,580
But...

382
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,280
- Like a fool, I can't even show anger.
- Who says you are a fool?

383
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,060
Why do you keep saying that?

384
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,120
Everyone hates you?

385
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,980
Nurse Nam, Nurse Jo, Dr. Han,
In Hye, and me...

386
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,360
What about us?

387
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,090
We are nothing?

388
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,570
People don't hate you
because you are a fool.

389
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,010
You become foolish because you think
that everyone will hate you.

390
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,280
Do it more.

391
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,650
About Professor Kim telling you to
go to the clinical pathology department...

392
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,450
I'll stop that, no matter what.

393
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,180
Although I can't guarantee you anything.

394
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,100
You should eat the beef rolls.
I'll just eat the vegetable rolls.

395
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,050
Aren't you sick of eating rolls?

396
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,120
Actually, I've become tired
of eating triangular rolls.

397
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,260
But, why do you keep on eating them?

398
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,280
I am sick of it, but I eat them
because the triangular shape is fun.

399
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,660
If you start eating it at the tip, it feels
like you are eating the top of a mountain.

400
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,950
You have a unique taste.

401
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,070
Right?

402
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,620
There are many qualified doctors...

403
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,660
But, how about keeping Dr. Park Shi On
at our hospital?

404
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,680
As you know,
he has many flaws as a surgeon.

405
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,890
You are right.

406
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,650
Even if his autistic tendencies improve,
the guardians will continue to be nervous.

407
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,220
So, I was thinking...

408
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:23,900
we should make Dr. Park the best
clinical pathologist.

409
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,050
A pediatric clinical pathologist.

410
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:36,500
I found out that you also looked
into that department for Dr. Park.

411
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,830
When I heard that,
I was impressed by your insight.

412
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,470
Dr. Park Shi On...

413
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,410
He's a very attractive character.

414
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,790
Trying to overcome autism
and become a doctor...

415
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:57,300
A genius with savant syndrome.

416
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,280
Very dramatic...

417
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,790
The patients won't be so against him
in the clinical pathology department.

418
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,450
There's no other doctor
better fit for this position than Dr. Park.

419
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,610
The media will show a huge interest, too.

420
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,610
It will be international news.

421
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,770
You want to use Dr. Park
as a marketing tool for the hospital?

422
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,000
Don't take it the wrong way.

423
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,300
I only mean the best.

424
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,160
A doctor is not a celebrity.

425
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,070
Professor Kim, the world has changed.

426
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,400
Doctors should be in the spotlight, too.

427
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,450
That doesn't change the fact that
they heal patients.

428
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,790
I will pretend that I didn't hear
any of what you said today.

429
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,090
Echo...

430
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,570
Heta Vizen.

431
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:18,360
When given to children, it's been reported to
cause cholestasis, pancreatitis, and hemorrhage.

432
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,410
Drainage tube...

433
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,100
You know...

434
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,990
Professor Kim wants me to
perform my first official surgery.

435
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,440
The last two were temporary.

436
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,930
<i>Wow, congratulations.</i>

437
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,520
But, I'm scared.

438
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,460
I thought I was over everything.

439
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,840
<i>You've overcome everything.
You don't need to be scared.</i>

440
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,550
Will I do a good job?

441
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,170
<i>You'll do a great job.
I believe in you, too.</i>

442
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,990
Thank you.

443
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,200
I didn't say anything.

444
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,320
But, I know everything.
Exactly what you said...

445
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,460
That's amazing.

446
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,480
I really hope everything will go well.

447
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,930
When I perform the surgery,
you need to come in, too.

448
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,820
If I have a hard time...

449
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:43,520
You have to say, 'There's a problem.
You have to hurry.'

450
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,780
Okay?

451
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,680
This is a big problem.

452
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,880
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow,
and get it checked out.

453
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,240
Lift up your shirt,
so I can check you.

454
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,220
No.

455
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,360
- Let me see.
- No.

456
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,330
What's that?

457
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,400
Isn't Eun Ok cute?

458
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:42,700
She's cute, but I feel bad for her.

459
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,360
She can't talk.

460
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,870
And she has nobody next to her.

461
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,610
But, strangely I feel better
when I see her.

462
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:01,300
She's going through hard times,
but she always smiles when she sees me.

463
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,670
Your mom smiles at you, too.

464
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,260
No.

465
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,630
She only smiles when I win an award.

466
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:19,060
I can't remember the last time
I smiled.

467
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,270
Look at me.

468
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,380
I want to hear you continue to sing.

469
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,630
It's so beautiful.

470
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,490
But, do you know what I want
to hear more?

471
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,370
Your laughter.

472
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,010
I'm not sure what would
make you more happy.

473
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,620
But, one thing is for sure.

474
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,490
You can only laugh if you are healthy.

475
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,370
Mom will be happy, too, when
she hears you laughing later.

476
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,010
Maybe even more than when
you are singing.

477
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,790
Don't cry.

478
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,270
Everything will be okay.

479
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,330
I received the files you sent.

480
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,770
We need to start
taking care of them one by one.

481
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,230
Thank you.

482
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,530
You are the one who reported
the Heta Vizen incident to the FDA, right?

483
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,620
What?

484
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,480
What kind of nonsense...

485
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,260
This is your phone record for
the past week.

486
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,790
There's even a direct phone number
to the FDA.

487
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,310
It's been confirmed that you
provided the information.

488
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:11,160
If you were going to use someone, you
should have used someone unrelated to this.

489
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,670
You were secretly doing all this?

490
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,190
For the sake of your relationship to the late
chairman, we are going to wrap this up quietly.

491
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,570
What if I can't end this quietly?

492
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,230
Do as you wish.

493
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,640
There's no records of use of Heta Vizen
at the hospital.

494
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,870
And strictly speaking...

495
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,210
your brother-in-law is responsible
for that.

496
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,350
You are all in this to get me.

497
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,480
I'll leave.

498
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,670
But...

499
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,990
you'll regret this.

500
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,560
Wait and see.

501
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,930
Hyuk Pil.

502
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,630
If you took care of it,
I wouldn't have gone through this!

503
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,940
I'm sorry.

504
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,970
You take care of yourself now.

505
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,150
I don't care what happens
to you anymore!

506
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,800
Hyuk Pil.

507
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,160
And don't ever come to my house again.

508
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Hyuk Pil.

509
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,230
Hyuk Pil!

510
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,900
Park Shi On.

511
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,800
Come here.

512
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,120
You should take care of yourself.

513
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,830
If your collar is messy,
you look really disheveled.

514
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,650
Thank you.

515
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,170
What are you saying?

516
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,640
You don't want to leave?

517
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,660
Are you in your right mind?

518
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,810
I won't leave until I'm all better.

519
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,970
We have to depart the country
next week.

520
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,790
We need to get ready starting today.

521
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,100
I'm not going to Germany.

522
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,500
You...

523
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,510
And, I'm going to have the surgery.

524
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,470
What?

525
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:11,150
Even if I go to Germany,
I won't be happy.

526
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,120
Even if I can't sing after the surgery,
I want to live happily.

527
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,230
I want to go to school,
and meet with friends.

528
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,680
I want to eat what I want to eat.

529
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,000
Be quiet!
I'm doing this for you.

530
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,730
Please listen to Kyu Wan.

531
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,660
You should stay out of this.

532
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:34,580
Why won't you listen to Kyu Wan?
If you don't listen, he'll feel suffocated.

533
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,870
- Get changed.
- No, I won't go to Germany.

534
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,270
- Hurry and get changed.
- I won't leave the hospital.

535
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,050
I'm not going to Germany,
and I'm going to have the surgery.

536
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,230
Let him be. Even if he has the surgery,
he will be able to sing...

537
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
It's nothing.

538
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,950
A doctor is not a religious leader.

539
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,070
You should never give any unfounded hope.

540
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,570
No.
I can't.

541
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,860
I can't say that.

542
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:28,740
No.

543
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,890
What do you mean discharge
when we didn't even allow it?

544
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,220
The mom's throwing a fit,
but the child's staying put.

545
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,110
Can you please leave?

546
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:53,380
The doctors here...

547
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,330
Do they normally make people
this sick and tired?

548
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,240
Do you know something?

549
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,180
When I was young,
we used to have a puppy at our house.

550
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:14,950
When it would snow a lot,
the puppy would run around in the yard.

551
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:19,880
I used to think that the puppy was
jumping around because he liked the snow.

552
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,300
But, that wasn't it.

553
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,760
The puppy was jumping around
because his paws were so cold.

554
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,850
Kyu Wan is like that puppy.

555
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:37,420
You think Kyu Wan sings
because he enjoys it.

556
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:40,510
But, Kyu Wan is cold.

557
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,390
That's why he sings louder.

558
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:47,260
Children are good.

559
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,870
Even if they don't want to, they force
themselves to do what is asked of them.

560
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,050
But, doing something by force
is not good.

561
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,340
I hate that, too.

562
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,710
But...

563
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,180
Even if she forces me to do
things I don't like...

564
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,760
I wish my mom was next to me.

565
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:19,000
Even if she forces me to
do things I hate...

566
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,820
Do you really have to hurt me
like this?

567
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,030
I don't want to hurt you.

568
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,780
That's why I want to have
the surgery.

569
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,590
I...

570
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,090
I want to laugh.

571
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:46,350
Like when I used to go to kindergarten,
and the time I rode on the carousel.

572
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,000
I want to laugh like that.

573
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,510
I don't hate you.

574
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,360
I was just upset.

575
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,670
Because you didn't know
how I felt at all.

576
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,630
I'm sorry, mom.

577
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,060
Why are you sorry?

578
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,650
Dr. Cha.

579
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,180
What is it?

580
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,130
Can you perform the surgery
on Kyu Wan?

581
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,040
I know Professor Kim is good.

582
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,110
But, I think it would be better if
you perform the surgery.

583
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,690
Why would it be better?

584
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:05,020
For some reason, I think you would
help Kyu Wan's dreams come true.

585
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:09,010
No, I don't have those abilities.

586
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,700
And the diagnosis has
already been made.

587
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,530
I want to help.

588
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,780
If that situation arises,
I want to help.

589
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,930
Instead of just standing around,
I want to help with the surgery.

590
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,320
You really think you can help?

591
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:37,090
I want to perform Kyu Wan's surgery.

592
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,020
As my first formal surgery.

593
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,390
I've never performed this kind of surgery.
And it's the first kind in the hospital.

594
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,530
That's why I think it's better.
It will be a first for anyone.

595
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,500
I'm not just saying that I want to
give myself a new challenge.

596
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:06,300
I want to try my best to protect
Kyu Wan's dreams.

597
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:14,480
As much as you are worried,
I know that you trust me.

598
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,430
So...

599
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,070
Please allow me to perform
the surgery.

600
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,220
You are slow at making decisions today.

601
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,020
Are you confident?

602
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,980
Yes, Professor Kim.

603
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,140
Kyu Wan's surgery is not life-threatening.

604
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,890
However, the area is so small that
we won't know exactly until we open it up.

605
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,830
There's another important thing.

606
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,710
This surgery will be an exchange of
a child's health for his talents.

607
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:05,620
I normally don't consider the patient's
personal situation in performing surgeries...

608
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,650
But, this surgery must be something that
Kyu Wan will appreciate for the rest of his life.

609
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,490
Do you understand, Dr. Cha?

610
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,820
Yes.

611
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,450
Professor Kim.

612
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:23,060
I want my first assistant to
be Dr. Park.

613
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,050
No.

614
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,580
Isn't it the performing surgeon's
choice to choose the first assistant?

615
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,410
Still, no.

616
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,920
I will talk to him.

617
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,260
You didn't hear what I said?

618
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,210
I heard.

619
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,930
You are going to switch departments.
You don't need to go into surgery.

620
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,360
This is my last dream, too.

621
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,770
Just like Kyu Wan, this is my last chance.

622
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,310
That's why I want to be with him.

623
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,990
I will allow your attendance.

624
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,090
I don't just want to attend.
I want to participate.

625
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,700
What if you have another spasm?

626
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,920
Then, I'll leave the surgery room.

627
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,280
If that's going to happen,
you shouldn't go in at all.

628
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,210
Why can't you trust me?

629
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,890
You don't hate me because
I made a mistake.

630
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,690
You hate me because you think
I'm going to make a mistake.

631
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,190
I won't make a mistake.

632
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,790
Never.

633
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,770
Just keep your promise.

634
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,730
If you have a spasm,
you are out immediately.

635
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:12,980
Thank you.

636
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,070
Thank you.

637
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,850
Yes!

638
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,570
<i>Yi On.</i>

639
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,560
<i>To be honest, I'm nervous.</i>

640
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,870
<i>But, I'll be okay, right?</i>

641
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,900
<i>You're going to help me, right?</i>

642
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,400
You're really not upset?

643
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,760
How can Dr. Cha ask for Park Shi On
instead of you?

644
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:53,870
I'm not upset.
I was a first assistant my first year, too.

645
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,670
But, you are different from Park Shi On.

646
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:58,080
Yeah, we are different.

647
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,550
Park Shi On may be better than me.

648
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,990
Since we are on the topic,
let's make something clear.

649
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,920
Hyun Woo, Sung Ho, and Dong Soo...

650
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,350
Who helped them overcome
their crisis?

651
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,690
And who helped Eun Ok talk?

652
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,330
Tell me, Woo Il Gyu.

653
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,720
Yeah, it's true that Park Shi On
is a troublemaker.

654
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,080
But, because of that we all forgot
that he helped all those children.

655
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,940
No, we didn't acknowledge it.

656
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,080
We only cared about our feelings.

657
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,170
Hey, Dr. Park.

658
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,250
Yes.

659
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,970
During the surgery, you think you will think of
a way for Kyu Wan to continue singing?

660
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,120
Yes.

661
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,440
I mean...

662
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,800
I might.

663
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,460
Did you tell Kyu Wan?

664
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,920
No.

665
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,330
Why not?

666
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,560
I didn't have the conviction.

667
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,710
You were not like that with
Sung Ho or Dong Soo.

668
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:19,630
Professor Kim told me not to give patients
any unfounded hope.

669
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,150
That's why I didn't tell Kyu Wan.

670
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:30,890
I'm so happy these days...
just watching you grow.

671
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:35,510
Hey!

672
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:37,770
Have some of mine.

673
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,870
Thank you.

674
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:45,670
<i>If we can find the fistula, we may be able to
save the nerve by twisting the thyroid cartilage.</i>

675
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,330
Are you looking over Kyu Wan's case?

676
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,590
Are you checking it over
because you can't trust me?

677
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,120
Yeah, so what?

678
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,590
I'll do well,
so you don't attack me.

679
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,780
I'm going.

680
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,180
Cha Yoon Seo.

681
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,640
- Congratulations on your first surgery.
- Thank you.

682
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,020
Eun Ok!

683
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,080
Do what you learned before, Eun Ok.

684
00:56:51,400 --> 00:57:05,770
Be... strong...

685
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,270
Eun Ok.

686
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,630
It's hard for Kyu Wan to
sing right now.

687
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,460
We have a special guest with us today.

688
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,870
It's Kim Kyu Wan who is hospitalized
in the pediatrics surgery department.

689
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,530
He is famous on the internet for his
heavenly voice.

690
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,610
Our first song starts with
Kim Kyu Wan's live stage.

691
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:14,620
<i>Mom, when I become healthy after the
surgery, please grant me one wish.</i>

692
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,870
Professor Kim.

693
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,690
I didn't come to perform the surgery.
I'm just going to watch.

694
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,810
- Start.
- Yes, sir.

695
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,750
- Army navy.
- Army navy.

696
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,590
Forceps.

697
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,320
Bovie.

698
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,360
- Suction.
- Suction.

699
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:20,220
We are going to remove the fistula.

700
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:23,030
There are infections around the
thyroid area.

701
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,710
But we may not have to
sever the thyroid.

702
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:29,720
Start from where you can
see the fistula.

703
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,750
Yes, sir.

704
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,550
<i>Kyu Wan.</i>

705
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,480
<i>I will help you to hold onto
your dreams.</i>

706
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,080
<i>I will do that.</i>

707
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,800
The fistula is all removed.

708
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,400
Will it be okay to continue?

709
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,360
Be careful.
That way is to the front of the cartilage.

710
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,090
It may be difficult to salvage
the laryngeal nerve.

711
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,810
Okay.
Mixter.

712
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,550
Hold on.

713
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,830
What is it?

714
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:10,060
Kyu Wan can sing.

715
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:18,290
We can make Kyu Wan's dreams
come true.

717
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:51,460
Don't you think he's changed
in the last day or two?

718
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:55,650
I didn't say that Professor Kim will
perform the surgery.

719
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,210
Starting tomorrow,
stay on call 24 hours at the hospital.

720
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,840
Congratulations.

721
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,880
Even the parts that are covered up?

722
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,000
What are you looking at?
Where did you look?

723
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,520
- What don't you know?
- I don't know the meaning of those words.

724
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,580
- How can you do that?
- Worse things will happen in the future.

725
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,180
- You didn't tell her your feelings?
- You have a beautiful heart.

726
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,880
There's something you must do
if you want my acknowledgment.
