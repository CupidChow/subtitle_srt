1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,110
Professor Kim, can't we change the direction,
and perform the tracheotomy?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,930
No.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,980
No matter where, the baby may die
due to excessive bleeding.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,420
Professor Kim!

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,950
We don't have time.
The mother is bleeding too much.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,440
And her heart is too weak. We need
to take the baby out, and close her up.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,910
Professor...

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,960
Professor Kim, you did
the best you could.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,880
We need to give up on the baby.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,810
No!

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,330
We need to save them both.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,800
There's a fifty/fifty chance
that both can live.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,620
They both have hope.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,330
So, we need to save them both.

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,280
Otherwise, the one who survives
will be sad, very sad.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,330
- We will make the incision from the side.
- It'll be hard like this.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,250
- The anatomical structure is all twisted up.
- You may damage the surrounding nerves.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,890
- This is the only way to save the baby.
- Then, check the sonogram.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,280
We have no time.

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,870
Park Shi On, come over here
and find the location of tracheostomy.

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,910
Feel the neck, and match up the
location with the past MRI image.

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,350
How can he determine the location
just by touching?

23
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,790
Just trust us.

24
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,950
Scalpel.

25
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,420
Park Shi On,
hurry up!

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,390
Here.

27
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,630
It's this part right here.

28
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,400
This is the location for the
second and third tracheal rings.

29
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,930
2.5 tube.
Hurry.

30
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,770
- You can cut the umbilical cord.
- Okay.

31
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,240
Clamp.

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,330
We've installed a monitor to check
the facial nerve.

33
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,170
We will remove the lymphangioma.

34
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,530
Scalpel.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,870
All the cysts are removed.

36
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,570
Dr. Cha, finish up,
and move the baby to the NICU.

37
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,980
Yes, sir.
Good job.

38
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,230
Did you call me?

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,190
Did you say that both the mother and
baby had a 50/50 chance of survival?

40
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,790
Yes.

41
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,630
To me, there was a 100 percent chance
that both would die.

42
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,380
Starting with 100 percent death risk...

43
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,190
it's the surgeon's job to lower
that percentage as much as possible.

44
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,110
After the percentage is reduced,
that number becomes the final probability.

45
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,370
The 50/50 you mentioned was not a
calculated percentage, it was only your wish.

46
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't ever estimate a number
when you are dealing with life and death.

47
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,970
Do you understand?

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,570
You may go.

50
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,630
Park Shi On.

51
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,550
Good job, today.

52
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,380
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,350
For what?

54
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,990
Scolding you for asking
too many questions at the meeting.

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,620
It's okay.

56
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,260
I was so sleepy that I don't
even remember getting scolded.

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,010
In any case, all the variables
you questioned came up.

58
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,280
That was nothing...

59
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,020
You are being haughty?

60
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm not being haughty.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
You are being too cocky.

62
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,400
I should take care of this kid.

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,150
How arrogant...

64
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,000
Good for you!

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,840
The night shift room is that way.

66
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,090
You're not going?

67
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,840
Are you walking me to the
main entrance?

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,420
No.

69
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,780
Is it because you think
I'll be scared to go alone in the dark?

70
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,360
No, it's not like that.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,270
Convenience store...

72
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,950
I was going there to buy bread.

73
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,880
If you open my drawer,
there's bread inside you can eat.

74
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,340
Not bread...

75
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,790
I'm going there to charge
my cell phone.

76
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,680
I have a charger in the drawer, too.

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,110
Hammer...

78
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm on my way to buy a hammer.

79
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,830
Hammer?

80
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,290
They sell hammers at the
convenience store?

81
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,710
Yes, they do.

82
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,060
Let's go.

83
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,520
Professor Kim.

84
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,280
Get in.

85
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,980
I'll take you home.

86
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,950
It's right here.
You don't need to take me.

87
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,500
It's on my way.

88
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,020
Don't forget to buy the hammer.

89
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,390
See you tomorrow.

90
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:54,260
<i>One step, when even
one step is hard to take</i>

91
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,950
<i>Because I know the weight
of that step, to my friend</i>

92
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,180
<i>To my love...</i>

93
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,550
Hey!

94
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,830
It's so beautiful.

95
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,090
Dr. Cha.

96
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,230
Just say it already!

97
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,910
Did you eat?

98
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,560
Right...

99
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,330
Did you make up with
Manager Chae Kyung?

100
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,200
What if she dumps you?

101
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,130
Then, I'll get dumped.

102
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,420
I know you'll take out all
your stress on us.

103
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,310
Before...

104
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,460
I loved Chae Kyung a lot.

105
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,390
You were truly a lovey dovey couple.

106
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,070
Just thinking about it...

107
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,860
makes my skin crawl.

108
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,260
I don't know why I forget everything
these days.

109
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,380
I feel like I'm surrounded by
curtains all around me.

110
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,590
I can't remember how I lived.

111
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,720
And I don't know how I should
live from now on.

112
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,460
I wonder about what I did
all day long.

113
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,600
It must be because you have too many
things to think about.

114
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,770
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,650
Bringing you down when you must
already be tired.

116
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,180
It's okay.

117
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,850
I'm sorry that I can't help you
unload your burdens more.

118
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,090
I'm so proud of you...

119
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,530
You even know what my burdens are.

120
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,550
I'll go in.

121
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,040
Okay.

122
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,450
Good job, today.

123
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,080
Get home safely.

124
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,970
<i>Dreaming of tomorrow</i>

125
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,900
<i>That beginning and the anticipation</i>

126
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,410
<i>It's not over yet...</i>

127
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,870
I guess they really do sell
hammers at the convenience store.

128
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,490
Yes. They had it underneath
the light bulbs.

129
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,170
7,000 won?

130
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,960
Tae Yang hardware store?

131
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
There's a convenience store
called Tae Yang hardware store?

132
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,880
Is there?

133
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,270
What's wrong with your face?

134
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,660
Your complexion has gotten so bad
in the past few days.

135
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,280
I've been having a lot of surgeries.

136
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,180
You should still take care of your health.

137
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,820
It's not like I can take care of you.

138
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,520
Your plans...

139
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,870
Nothing has changed?

140
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,000
I see.

141
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,870
Oppa.

142
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,960
I make you that uncomfortable?

143
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,900
It's not that you make me
uncomfortable.

144
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,460
Your plans make me uncomfortable.

145
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,370
What has happened to us?

146
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,480
I should be sad that
you want to take time apart.

147
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,770
We should both be very upset.

148
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,680
But, neither one of us
feels anything.

149
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,510
More than your words,
it makes me sad that I don't feel anything.

150
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,410
Are you here to see a baby?

151
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,700
Yes.

152
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,710
What's the baby's name?

153
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,100
I don't think the baby has a name, yet.

154
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,790
The mother's name is Lee Soo Jin.

155
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,670
The surgery went well.

156
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,770
And the recovery is going well, too.

157
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,940
Have you gone to see your wife?

158
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,870
The one who's struggling the most
is your wife.

159
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,650
But, she has no one next to her.

160
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,470
Do you know why Ms. Soo Jin
is so great?

161
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,040
She doesn't resent anyone.

162
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,110
It's not because she's foolish
or overly nice.

163
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,320
It's just her way of loving her family.

164
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,010
That's why she's strong.

165
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,680
She will be a better mom
than anyone else.

166
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,110
You call that a love confession?

167
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,890
What is that?

168
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,200
'Did you eat?'

169
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,330
Seriously...

170
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,820
I couldn't say anything.

171
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,950
You can't express yourself.
You can't confess your feelings.

172
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,650
What's the point of coaching you?

173
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:24,430
I can finally understand why my
teachers gave up on me.

174
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,120
Does that lady look at you as a child?

175
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,490
Then, it can make confessing
your feelings hard.

176
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,310
Whether she's older or not,
if she looks at you as a child...

177
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,930
It will be very hard.

178
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,890
Tell me the lady's name and birthday.

179
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,450
I'll read your fortunes,
and see if you are a good match.

180
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,200
Fortunes?

181
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,630
Yes.

182
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,190
I just need to know
her name and birthday.

183
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,120
Really?

184
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,500
Of course.

185
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,920
I read fortunes for all my
couple friends.

186
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,560
- Her name is...
- Yes?

187
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,050
- Snow...
-Snow...

188
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,020
- Wha...
- Wha?

189
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,980
That's a tacky name...

190
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,250
And?

191
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,620
White...

192
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,590
Forget it!
I don't want to know.

193
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,590
She looks like
Snow White to me.

194
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,930
Did you talk to your husband
on the phone?

195
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,920
He just left me a voicemail.

196
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
That he's sorry he couldn't come.

197
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,950
It must be hard for him, too.

198
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,800
People call him a 'mama boy.'

199
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,520
But my mother-in-law
is very burdensome.

200
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,660
Anybody would be like that
around my mother-in-law.

201
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,700
I want to see the baby.

202
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,870
But I haven't been able to see him
because of my condition.

203
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,090
Wait one minute.

204
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,240
I took a picture.

205
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
He's so cute.

206
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,120
Honey.

207
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,600
Honey, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,630
When you were going through
so much...

209
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,180
I couldn't be with you.

210
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,630
And thank you.

211
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,050
For protecting our baby.

212
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,710
You don't need to thank me.

213
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,820
That's what mothers do.

214
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,860
When you are all better...

215
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,740
let's take the baby and
go to the U.S.A.

216
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,260
Honey.

217
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,770
I'm sorry.

218
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,270
I'm really sorry.

219
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,300
I told you to come on time
for the test.

220
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,560
I'm sorry.

221
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,140
I'm late because I had to
tend to patients.

222
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,690
You have to answer me as soon as
I ask the test question.

223
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,260
If you pass five seconds,
I'll mark it as wrong.

224
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,960
Are you ready?

225
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,710
Yes.

226
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,000
A child is vomiting. It's not indigestion
or enteritis.

227
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,570
What can you suspect?
Tell me two categories.

228
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,250
It's categorized into bilious vomit
and non-bilious vomit.

229
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,940
If it's bilious vomit?

230
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,340
It could be mid-gut volvulus, intussusception,
ileus, intestinal fistula, or incarcerated hernia.

231
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,620
- Non-bilious vomit?
- If there is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis...

232
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,760
gastroesophageal reflux...

233
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,680
Convulsion, narcolepsy, or hypotension...

234
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,270
it could be
congenital metabolic abnormality.

235
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,360
Below the right rib, there is a tumor the size
of an acorn, the child vomits, and turns cold...

236
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,410
- What's the problem?
- It's hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

237
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,370
- What's the surgery method?
- Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy must be performed.

238
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:17,670
An experienced surgeon should perform the
surgery to reduce fatal complications.

239
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,340
Next question.

240
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,930
When a newborn has swelling in the stomach
and there is a delay in meconium discharge...

241
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,510
and microcolon is seen in colon study...

242
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:31,720
it could be total colonic aganglionosis,
small intestine obstruction, or meconium ileus.

243
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,480
Good.

244
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,820
That's it for today.

245
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,440
You passed all the questions for today.

246
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,730
Go.

247
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,720
Okay.

248
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,960
Thank you.

249
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,220
Yes.

250
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,730
How did today's testing go?

251
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,870
He passed all questions.

252
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,590
What a monster-like kid...

253
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,630
They were the most difficult questions?

254
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,910
Yes.

255
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,030
He even answered my third
question correctly.

256
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,480
What was the question?

257
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,220
Pediatric stomach fever.

258
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,650
I didn't even know the answer
because it's an Eastern Medicine topic.

259
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,220
How is Joon Young?

260
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,170
The doctor didn't say much?

261
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,760
Just stay there.

262
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,500
You don't need to come to Korea.

263
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,230
I'll call you back later.

264
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,460
You have two days left
before you have to leave.

265
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,010
I know.

266
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,110
It's okay if you want to
leave before then.

267
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,160
I'll take care of it.

268
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,980
I will trust that you will
take care of everything.

269
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,900
Director Choi.

270
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,410
You should have held onto me.

271
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,000
Dr. Park is doing so well.

272
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,810
Really.

273
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,910
Just yesterday, he was a big help to us.

274
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,690
I'm sure you are teaching him well.

275
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,640
No, he's trying very hard.

276
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,320
When I think about Shi On
as a young boy...

277
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,700
This is really like a dream.

278
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,790
He couldn't even talk well.

279
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,970
I worried so much about him.

280
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,620
I thought about dying together
several times everyday.

281
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,860
This is all my fault.

282
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,110
He should have met a better mom.

283
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,460
It's not like that.

284
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,850
Don't say that.

285
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,610
But...

286
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,530
You don't know where
Shi On's father is?

287
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,820
I don't know.

288
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,950
I saw him for the last time
when I left home.

289
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,970
I've done wrong, too.

290
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,230
But Shi On's condition got worse
because of his father.

291
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,370
Shi On and I used to get
beat up constantly.

292
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,930
<i>Shi On got beat for being different
from others.</i>

293
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,490
<i>I got beat for giving birth
to Shi On.</i>

294
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,080
<i>It may be wrong of me to say...</i>

295
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,320
<i>but, I hope he never shows up
in front of Shi On.</i>

296
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,090
I'm sure you were contacted by
the marketing department.

297
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,150
There must be other departments better fit
for making this documentary.

298
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,500
No, the pediatrics surgery department
here is so well known.

299
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,470
It sounds like a good cause.
You should agree to it.

300
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,550
Should I change into something different?
I look rather grungy.

301
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,680
No, we can shoot just
the way you are.

302
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,230
Dr. Park, what are you doing?

303
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,410
I heard I'll be coming out on TV.

304
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,560
Park Shi On.

305
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,660
- What time is Min Soo's surgery?
- 12:30.

306
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,280
Okay.
Prepare for it.

307
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Yes, sir.

308
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,640
Please confirm this patient's
NPO order.

309
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,060
What should I help with?

310
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,370
Dr. Park.

311
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,590
Look here.

312
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,300
Dr. Park.

313
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,790
Stop looking.

314
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
Should we try again?

315
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,530
Why are you looking into the
camera like that?

316
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,160
I always do that when I see
a TV camera.

317
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,050
No matter how far away the camera is,
I run over and put my face in.

318
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,910
You want to be a celebrity?

319
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,130
No.

320
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,340
I do that in case mom and dad
happen to see my face on TV.

321
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,320
I heard that parents recognize their
children's faces even when they're all grown.

322
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,250
If they see me on TV,
I hope they will recognize me.

323
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,050
Hey!

324
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,660
Did you see my interview?
They said I was the best.

325
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,940
I know...
You can do this.

326
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,380
Look at you talk...

327
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,880
But did Professor Kim and Dr. Cha
go home already?

328
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,270
Yes.
They left together earlier.

329
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,950
They left together?

330
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,480
Yes.

331
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,270
Where did they say they were going?

332
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,530
I don't know about that.

333
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,770
But...

334
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,520
is Professor Kim and Manager Chae Kyung
on bad terms these days?

335
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,150
She hasn't been coming by lately.

336
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,350
Hey...
I'm sure they date outside.

337
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,070
Those are the kids that start
the false rumors.

338
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,620
Wait.

339
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,840
Are Professor Kim and
Manager Yoo Chae Kyung dating?

340
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,630
They are engaged to get married.

341
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,220
Really?

342
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,740
Hello.

343
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,250
Are you here to see me?

344
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,830
Yes.

345
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,360
Where are we going together?

346
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,610
You'll see when we get there.
Don't ask me.

347
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:46,080
Are you kidnapping me? You should
at least tell me where we are going.

348
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,580
I want to treat you as your senior
for the first time in 12 years.

349
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,570
You haven't taken care of me
for 12 years... Why all of a sudden?

350
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,180
You really need to talk back like that?

351
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,500
I don't always talk back.

352
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,560
Maybe once for every two times
you speak.

353
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,040
Why are you bringing me here?

354
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,870
Pick one out.

355
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,880
I have a lot of clothes.

356
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,000
You always complain that you only
get to wear grungy gowns.

357
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,250
That's a gown.

358
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,490
And I don't wear
expensive clothes like these.

359
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,480
Just do as I say.

360
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,740
Just buy it for Manager Chae Kyung.
I'll pick one out for you.

361
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,060
Finish in 10 minutes.

362
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,340
Finish what?

363
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,600
There's someone I like...

364
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,130
I need to confess my feelings.

365
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,640
What?

366
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,890
But, I don't know how to do it.

367
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,020
So, I was curious how Professor Kim
confessed his feelings for you.

368
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:20,000
Professor Kim is such a great man.
I'm sure he confessed in a really cool way.

369
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,720
Why don't you ask the professor then?

370
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,450
If I ask him,
he'll just say one thing.

371
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,470
What's that?

372
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,660
Park Shi On.

373
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,800
Get out!

374
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,260
Go home!

375
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,600
Please tell me.

376
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,080
But, what do I do?

377
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,390
I'm the one who confessed first.

378
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,570
Oh...

379
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,650
Then, Professor Kim
never confessed his feelings for you?

380
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,360
He did later.

381
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,290
What did he say?

382
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,240
Well...

383
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,510
I don't know...

384
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,490
I can't remember.

385
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,520
I think it was really touching...

386
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,020
Why can't I remember?

387
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,850
It's possible to not remember.

388
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,880
I can't remember my mother.

389
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,910
I'm sure we had good memories.

390
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,520
But, I can't remember.

391
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,000
But...

392
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,090
Thinking hard about it...

393
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,530
I think I'm the one who's
trying not to remember.

394
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,180
When I was young,
it was so hard and painful.

395
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,700
I wanted to erase all memories
of that time.

396
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,620
As I was erasing, I think I lost
everything about mom and dad, too.

397
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,300
I wanted to erase all the bad things...

398
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,350
but the good things got erased
along with them.

399
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,440
Still... How can the four of us
share this one bottle?

400
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,840
I can drink two bottles by myself.

401
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,770
Dr. Han.

402
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,430
We won't get caught.

403
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,540
We came so far away from
the hospital.

404
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,650
Stop.

405
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,060
We may have an emergency,
so just drink this one bottle.

406
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,890
Dr. Han, what's wrong?

407
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,300
Hold on.

408
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,920
He'll be back soon.
Let's eat.

409
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,940
Welcome.

410
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,480
In Young.

411
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,260
How did you know about this place?

412
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,790
I saw you walking into this place.

413
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,750
Then, you should've just gone your way.
Why did you follow me in?

414
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,530
It's amusing seeing me like this, right?

415
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,050
This is how I live.

416
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:42,340
It's a life that people like you
can't understand.

417
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,790
Did I say something?

418
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,230
'You are so amusing.
Living like this...'

419
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,960
'I don't know about this lifestyle.'

420
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,690
Did I say that?

421
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,990
As soon as I saw you,
I had a doctor's thoughts.

422
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,490
'It must be hard for her trying to save up
enough money for In Hye's surgery.'

423
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,900
'She must be harming her health because
she has to work so late into the night.'

424
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,970
In any case, I'm sorry.

425
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,200
For making you get upset.

426
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,430
I'm sure you won't, but
please don't say anything to In Hye.

427
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,730
Why are you out here?

428
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,530
I was just hot.

429
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,890
Are you coming back from somewhere?

430
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,560
Yeah, I had to go somewhere.

431
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,710
I bought some clothes.

432
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,380
I see.

433
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,670
Do you have something to tell me?

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,440
It's nothing.

435
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,090
Good night.

436
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,390
I have to go back to the hospital.

437
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,950
<i>All fear disappears</i>

438
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,150
<i>You look good</i>

439
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:57,790
<i>Smile more for me</i>

440
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,600
<i>I'll always firmly protect you from fear</i>

441
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,700
I'm so proud of you.

442
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,440
You even know what
my burdens are.

443
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,000
<i>Smile more for me like you are now</i>

444
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:27,910
<i>I hope you won't be surprised
by my stammering words</i>

445
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:33,190
<i>My dear</i>

446
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:43,950
<i>In my dream I called you,
who doesn't seem real to me</i>

447
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:51,940
<i>All fear disappears</i>

448
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,390
<i>You look good</i>

449
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,800
<i>Smile more for me</i>

450
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,970
<i>I'll always firmly protect you from fear</i>

451
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:14,950
<i>Smile more for me like you are now</i>

452
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:23,470
The rumors about our hospital
were true this time.

453
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
A few days ago

454
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,280
the vice president gave the director a
proposal for opening up a 'for-profit' hospital.

455
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,750
The vice president?

456
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:39,080
I don't know who the leader is,
but I think the vice president is involved.

457
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,940
- He approached Professor Kim Do Han, too.
- Even Oppa?

458
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,450
He needs the director and
Professor Kim, too.

459
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,510
For the value of the hospital.

460
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,950
What is it?

461
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,080
The banks called, asking us to pay off
all the loans.

462
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,050
What?

463
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,480
You scared me.

464
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:13,240
- What if you fall?
- I won't fall.

465
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,320
I'm not a kindergartener.

466
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:21,070
What is it? You need more info
about my sister?

467
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,230
Good morning.

468
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,390
Hello.

469
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,300
Dr. Park.

470
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,280
Yes?

471
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,790
Are you upset at me?

472
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,650
No.

473
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,230
Then why are you acting like that
since yesterday?

474
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,900
I'm not doing anything.

475
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,480
Park Shi On.

476
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,230
Follow me.

477
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,800
You still look anxious
during every surgery.

478
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,180
The first time you assisted,
your hand was shaking.

479
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,060
If it wasn't for Dr. Cha,
you would have made a mistake.

480
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,770
You are the best at memorizing
and organizing information.

481
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,250
But, you will never become
a surgeon like this.

482
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,060
You need to be able to control
yourself completely.

483
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,830
You'll only be able to overcome your weakness
if you withstand the worst case scenarios.

484
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,770
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

485
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,020
You have the ability to conjure up
mental images in your head.

486
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,830
Imagine what I am describing,
and become the main surgeon.

487
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,060
- What?
- Let's start.

488
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,730
On this table, there is a premature newborn
born with a ruptured membrane.

489
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,040
There is extreme metabolic acidosis.
The platelet level is low.

490
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,560
There is extreme abdominal bloating,
and the color is blue. What's the problem?

491
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,760
It's meconium peritonitis!

492
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,160
Within the procedural knowledge you have,
you will operate on this baby.

493
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,140
If you waste any time,
the baby will die.

494
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,340
Begin.

495
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,650
What are you doing?

496
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,180
Scalpel.

497
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,500
This is an emergency surgery.

498
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,840
Yes.

499
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,480
Don't you know that you'll damage the
newborn's liver if you press that hard?

500
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,100
- Army navy.
- Army navy.

501
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,190
Forceps.

502
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,750
Mixter.

503
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,700
Forceps.

504
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,980
It's bleeding wherever
enterolysis was performed.

505
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,610
Hurry and find the point of origin.

506
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:25,040
The baby's body temperature is dropping.
What's taking so long?

507
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,490
Bleeding is getting heavy.
Pulse is dropping. Arrest!

508
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,530
The baby died.

509
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,670
This is an imaginary scenario,
you can't even do this?

510
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,580
If you continue like this,
you'll never perform a surgery.

511
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,360
You'll just be a shell of a surgeon
blabbing on...

512
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,590
That's what you want?

513
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,140
No.

514
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,790
Don't even think about telling yourself
that you've improved a lot since before.

515
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,480
The way I see it...

516
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,320
You haven't changed at all.

517
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,850
You worked hard.

518
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,390
Did you see what I did?

519
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,870
No, I had a patient.
I didn't get to see.

520
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,170
Just think of it as a simple practice.

521
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,460
Professor Kim said that the patient died.

522
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,640
He said that to make you work harder.

523
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,850
Don't rush it.

524
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,030
You can work it out slowly.

525
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:15,390
You still have a lot of time.

526
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,940
You are training him a lot
tougher than I thought you would.

527
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,760
This is extreme training,
but he should bear through it.

528
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,820
I think he's more sensitive to
psychological pressure.

529
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,790
More than others with
autistic tendencies.

530
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:51,450
He had severe trauma regarding his father
when he was young.

531
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,920
Father?

532
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,180
Before, when I couldn't do
something right

533
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,560
I just thought to myself that I'm
just a bit handicapped.

534
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,110
But these days, I feel embarrassed,
and it makes me feel bad.

535
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,950
Of course.

536
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,040
Nobody is proud of something
they can't do well.

537
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,170
I don't want to show people
things that I'm embarrassed about.

538
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,850
I can't do that.

539
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,720
There's still too many things
that I can't do right.

540
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:22,550
- I'm just a shell of a surgeon.
- Stop saying that.

541
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,540
Who's only a shell?

542
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:31,900
Are you embarrassed about showing this
side of yourself to that lady?

543
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,020
How did you find out about
Park Shi On's history?

544
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,210
I heard from the director.

545
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,490
I'm not going to train him
any less harshly because of that.

546
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,700
I'm sure Park Shi On always felt
weak as he was growing up.

547
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,280
He was used to
sympathy and pity from others.

548
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,360
I need to break that.

549
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,380
No matter how painful it is.

550
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,940
Come out.
It's about to begin.

551
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,680
<i>For the future of the children...
And for the happiness of the family...</i>

552
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,380
<i>These are the pediatric surgeons from
Sung Won University Hospital.</i>

553
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:29,990
<i>Let's listen to the beautiful stories of these
doctors who work daily to help these children.</i>

554
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:34,080
Children are our dream.
Children are our hope.

555
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,450
What's this?

556
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,280
Everyone watching this will think that
we are all like him.

557
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,080
What's wrong with that?

558
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,480
Woo Il Kyu, watch what you say.

559
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,740
Okay.

560
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,090
<i>The nurses and doctors will never
stop trying to help these children.</i>

561
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,110
Over here!

562
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,640
Get me another bottle!

563
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,940
Stop drinking.

564
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,730
You don't even have the money to pay.

565
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,690
I'm going to pay you back.

566
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:16,490
Otherwise, I'm going to break
everything here!

567
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,780
Fine, I'll give it to you.

568
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:28,940
<i>It's my dream that there will be
no more sick children in this country.</i>

569
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,800
<i>Sick children need to get
treated right away.</i>

570
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,230
Come to the hospital
whenever you need to.

571
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,770
Park Shi On.

572
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:43,630
Follow me.

573
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,450
What?

574
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,020
You don't want to do it?

575
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,210
You're not going to do it?

576
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,330
I'll do it.

577
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,230
There's a 10 year old boy with abdominal
bleeding from a fall related accident.

578
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,470
Spleen and liver hemorrhaging is possible.

579
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,700
A branch has caused a
big laceration in the abdomen.

580
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,720
Think over the surgery steps.

581
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,110
Don't let the child die
like last time.

582
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,470
Do you understand?

583
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,040
Yes.

584
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,290
Scalpel.

585
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,290
The child's breathing is becoming unstable.

586
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,540
What is it you need to do
in this situation?

587
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,950
I need to check whether it's
pneumothorax or hemothorax.

588
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,010
Hurry! Can't you see that the
saturation level is dropping?

589
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,890
Chest...
Chest tube.

590
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,940
Arrest!

591
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,640
Defibrillator... no.
Atropine...

592
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,330
Atropine.

593
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,000
Defibrillator.
Defibrillator!

594
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,300
Dead.

595
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,680
You lost the chance before
the asystole.

596
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,480
Defibrillator is of no use.

597
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,090
Nothing has improved!

598
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,370
I'll stop for today.

599
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,900
Who said you can?
Do it again.

600
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,160
I'll practice by myself.

601
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,750
What will change if you are alone?

602
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,670
You are not easy to give up.

603
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,500
I can't do it!

604
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,860
Then, quit.

605
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,690
If this continues, you are not a surgeon
healing people with a scalpel.

606
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,460
You are a murderer holding a knife.

607
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,640
It's okay.
You can practice.

608
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,420
Why did you come to see?

609
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,130
I came to see if you are doing well.

610
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,260
But...

611
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,750
I didn't do well.

612
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,260
I messed up again.

613
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:36,370
Shi On, should we go eat something?

614
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:50,240
Or should we go for a drink?

615
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,390
I...

616
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,360
I won't feel better by eating.

617
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,410
And I...

618
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,080
I'm not a little kid who
only likes eating good food.

619
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,360
Shi On!

620
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,970
Shi On!

621
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:13,390
I've been following you for 10 minutes!
Say something!

622
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,050
I know you are upset.

623
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:21,310
You should give yourself some time.

624
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,300
Shi On.

625
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,960
- Professor Kim just wants to make you stronger.
- I know.

626
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,060
I know why the professor is doing this.

627
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,540
Then, why...

628
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,130
I'm embarrassed.

629
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,370
I'm upset because I don't want to be
embarrassed in front of you!

630
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,640
You don't need to feel embarrassed
in front of me.

631
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,480
I didn't feel that way before,
but now I feel embarrassed.

632
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,020
Why now?

633
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:56,880
Because... I like you!

634
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,700
Every time I see you, I hiccup
and my heart starts beating fast!

635
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,010
I don't want to look like a fool
in front of someone I like.

636
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,950
I want to do better,
I want to brag...

637
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,150
But, it's not that easy.

638
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,500
Shi On!

639
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,940
<i>Even if I lack a lot</i>

640
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,700
<i>There is one person who loves you</i>

641
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:45,890
<i>I can't express my love to you with words</i>

642
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:54,200
<i>Even if you add all of the world,
it's not enough</i>

643
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:02,120
<i>Until my tears dry,
until my heart wears out</i>

644
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:14,320
<i>The love that I want and long for is you</i>

645
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,490
Hey!

646
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,400
If you bumped into us,
you should apologize!

647
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,700
I'm sorry.

648
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,610
Hey!

649
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,180
Do it more respectfully.

650
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,170
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,970
- Doesn't he sound like he's mocking us?
- I know.

652
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,720
I'm not mocking you.
I'm being sincere.

653
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,490
What's wrong with his speech?
Is he not normal?

654
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,180
No.

655
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,060
Don't speak like that.

656
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,430
Are you going to hit us?

657
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,300
I don't like people who start arguments.

658
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,380
Please stop.

659
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,080
This kid...

660
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,000
- Are you preaching to us?
- Are you crazy?

661
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,870
You want to die?

662
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,450
Get up!

663
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,640
Get up!

664
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,100
Who do you think you are?

665
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,430
You want to die?

666
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,600
You want to die?

667
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,910
It's not like that.

668
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:08,550
We were just walking along,
and he hit us first.

669
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,170
I understand, just give
me your social security number.

670
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,880
What do you understand?
We are telling the truth.

671
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,610
Whatever.
Just give me your social security number.

672
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,810
He's the one who hit us first!

673
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,330
You beat up that other guy first!

674
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,500
They are lying.
Can't you tell that he's a retard?

675
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,740
What did you say?

676
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,490
I said he's a retard!
What?

677
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,760
A retard?

678
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:37,880
A retard?

679
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,800
Hit me!

680
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,460
A retard?

681
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,760
How did you find out?

682
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:01,440
A call came through regarding
verification of identity.

683
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,610
Why were you just getting
hit like that?

684
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,140
You should have beat up
at least one of them!

685
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,450
I can't hit people.

686
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,330
How much longer are you
going to live like this?

687
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,280
Letting them call you a retard like that?

688
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm not a retard.

689
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,920
Then, prove it.

690
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:35,020
If you continue what you did in the
operating room before, you'll never change.

691
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,990
Professor Kim!

692
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,770
Shi On.

693
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:01,040
What you said before...

694
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,400
I'm sorry.

695
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,470
It's nothing to be sorry about.

696
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:10,410
In this world,
there are many qualifications.

697
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,060
Qualifications to become a student...
Qualifications to become a doctor...

698
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,140
Qualifications to become a man...

699
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,910
And...

700
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:25,410
Qualifications to like or love
another person.

701
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,730
I still have a lot of qualifications
I need to achieve.

702
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:43,550
If I don't have qualifications,
there's nothing I can do.

703
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,580
I...

704
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:52,200
I want to walk alone.

705
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,210
I didn't like walking alone.

706
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,090
But, I want to walk alone today.

707
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,630
Okay.

708
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,450
I understand.

709
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:25,200
<i>The you in my heart is not weak</i>

710
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:31,980
<i>You can cry all you want</i>

711
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:41,230
<i>Because holding it in
doesn't mean you're strong</i>

712
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:48,260
<i>Always love, love yourself</i>

713
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:57,620
<i>Don't be afraid, believe in me</i>

714
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:07,790
<i>Sadness and pain are just keys to happiness</i>

715
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,860
<i>Surpass me.</i>

716
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:04,790
I'm teaching you how you can
remain in this hospital.

717
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:16,160
I think his pride was hurt yesterday.

718
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,720
I never saw him like that.

719
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,850
That's a good thing.

720
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,630
If he has pride,
he'll be more persistent.

721
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:26,150
But...

722
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,520
But, what?

723
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,990
It's nothing.

724
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,300
I'll do it again.

725
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,340
I won't give up easily
like yesterday.

726
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,460
Can I trust you?

727
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,150
Yes, Professor Kim.

728
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,350
I'm sorry to interrupt.

729
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:00,060
Dr. Park, you have a visitor outside.

730
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,280
Shi On.

731
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,570
Park Shi On.

732
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,360
This bastard...

733
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,310
he hasn't changed at all.

734
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,640
You retarded kid!

735
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,210
<i>Retard!</i>

736
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:43,540
<i>Why did you have to be born?</i>

737
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,550
<i>Just die!</i>

738
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:47,680
<i>Die!</i>

739
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,720
Die!

740
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:52,800
Die!

741
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,860
Shi On.

742
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,500
It's your father.

743
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,580
Your father is here!

744
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,450
Get over here!
