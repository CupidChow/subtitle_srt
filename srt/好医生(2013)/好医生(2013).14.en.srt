1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,350
- Anesthesia is finished.
- Okay, I'll be there soon.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,120
The vitals are dropping.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,250
- There's bleeding around the liver.
- Gauze.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,850
We are going to pack it with gauze.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,370
- Professor Kim, what about that child?
- Wait!

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,190
BP can't be sustained.
You need to start quickly.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,060
Professor Kim.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,750
Put glue on the bottom portion.
More blood transfusion.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,830
Glue.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,460
Professor Kim.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,740
I can't leave this room right now.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,250
Then, what do we do?

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,310
Park Shi On.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,650
You perform the surgery.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,240
Excuse me?

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,240
What are you waiting for?
Get ready!

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,060
- How can I perform the surgery?
- If you don't start in five minutes, she will die!

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,110
Suction.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,480
I can't do that!
I'm only a first year resident.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,800
This is an emergency.
This is like war.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,900
We need to save the patient!

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,200
You are the only one who can
perform the surgery on her right now.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,280
If we wait for another surgeon,
it will be too late.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,780
You have three minutes.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,410
Park Shi On!

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,690
Hurry up!

28
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,670
I will do it.

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,600
Professor Kim, if it's okay with you,
I will assist Dr. Park.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay. Go in.

31
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,590
You should start.

32
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,630
Doctor!

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,290
We need more people.

34
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,510
Please ask if there are any
extra doctors in Dr. Cha's room.

35
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,910
Dr. Park, start.

36
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,220
Scalpel.

37
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,340
Park Shi On is performing the surgery
next door.

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,750
Dr. Park?

39
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,340
Yes, there was nobody else,
so Professor Kim assigned him.

40
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,750
They are asking for an assistant.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,390
Then, you should go.

42
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,870
The bleeding has stopped.

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,820
- What about the vitals?
- It's returning to normal.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,290
The BP is not rising despite
the blood transfusion.

45
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,870
Is she still bleeding a lot?

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,280
Yes, I haven't found
the splenic blood vessel, yet.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,590
Gauze.

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,060
It's continuing to bleed a lot
on this side.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,960
- The source of bleeding...
- We've already suctioned out 1,000 cc of blood.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,380
You need to hurry!

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm here.

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,980
Suction.

53
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,240
Dr. Park.

54
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,580
You need to hurry.

55
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,740
- Underneath the spleen..
- Don't get nervous, Dr. Park.

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,080
BP is dropping.

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,670
Transfuse more blood.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,340
Hand me the right angle.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,670
I will begin extracting the spleen.

60
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,060
I can't see...

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,330
<i>Shi On.</i>

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,220
<i>It's not anybody else that's
made you change like this.</i>

63
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,510
<i>You made yourself change.</i>

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,150
So, trust in yourself more.

65
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,930
Okay?

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,190
You must be able to overcome the
worst situation to win over yourself.

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,640
If you continue like this, you are not a
surgeon healing people with a scalpel.

68
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,460
You are a murderer holding a knife.

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,040
I will carefully approach the
hilum splenium.

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,740
Vascular clamp.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,680
Long forceps.

72
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,050
Right angle.

73
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,710
Tie.

74
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,000
The splenic artery has been closed off.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,510
I will close off the splenic veins.
Suction.

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,520
It's finished.
Dr. Joo, you finish up.

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,330
Suction.

78
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
Metzenbaum.

79
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,500
Spleen has been extracted.
Vitals?

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,510
Her vitals are returning to normal.

81
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,020
Good job, Dr. Park.

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,770
Good job.

83
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,760
Good job.

84
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,880
<i>I did it, Dr. Cha.</i>

85
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,660
<i>I did well.</i>

86
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,980
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

87
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,760
<i>Good job, Shi On.</i>

88
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,770
<i>I don't think you'll need me anymore.</i>

89
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,760
Yoon Jung's father.

90
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,040
Yoon Jung's surgery went well.

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,490
She will be okay now.

92
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,080
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

93
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:31,020
When Yoon Jung is all better, she
will be able to pick you up again from work.

94
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,800
She will be healthy again.

95
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,560
Why couldn't you stop the
bleeding more quickly?

96
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,980
It's something we practiced in
mock surgery.

97
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,840
It took longer than expected
to find the source of bleeding.

98
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,360
You need to minimize that time.

99
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,350
If anything unexpected comes up,
you may need that time.

100
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,100
Yes, sir.

101
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,790
Unless an emergency like this occurs again

102
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,950
you won't be performing another surgery
for another five years.

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,290
Not until your second year fellowship.

104
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,050
I will tell you now what I would
say in five years.

105
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,430
Congratulations on your first surgery.

106
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,440
If you boast around that you performed
a surgery, I will crush you.

107
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,970
Do you understand?

108
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,350
Yes.

109
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,770
It's Dr. Park!

110
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,240
Get him!

111
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,160
Make sure you leave tonight's schedule
open. Everyone worked hard.

112
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,770
- Let's go out for a team dinner.
- Yes!

113
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,070
Chairman Jung...

114
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,710
You haven't changed at all
in 15 years.

115
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,600
It's not like that this time.

116
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm trying to make a legitimate investment.

117
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,950
Is that why you're acting as the creditor
and threatening us?

118
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:33,490
Most of your bonds are bad.
We are trying to save you.

119
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,620
Shut your mouth.
How dare you insult us!

120
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,840
We can't allow for this kind of takeover.

121
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,440
I don't think the two of you are in
any situation to be picky.

122
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,420
I'm planning to take over the hospital.
Of course, you would be included, Director Choi.

123
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,650
I will be expanding my investment,
and building a pediatric surgery center.

124
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,170
That's my condition.
Isn't it great?

125
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,930
One last condition...

126
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,560
Chairwoman Lee, you just need to resign.

127
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:21,230
I will just watch from afar. I'll appoint
a new young and smart chairwoman.

128
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,400
If we refuse?

129
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,710
There are lots of corporations
looking to buy the hospital.

130
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,560
I'm a businessman.
I can just sell the hospital.

131
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,990
I'm sure the new owners will
completely ruin the hospital.

132
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,320
Because of you,
my husband died.

133
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,290
You think I'll abide by your plans?

134
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,220
That's why you need to think well, so that
another tragedy like that doesn't happen again.

135
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,470
What?

136
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,410
How dare you say that?

137
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,040
You have two months to
pay back the debt.

138
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,980
Just wrap things up
within that time.

139
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,680
Still...

140
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I feel better that
I told you everything.

141
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,550
I feel upset,
but my heart feels at ease.

142
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,690
What is it now?

143
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,830
What do you mean?

144
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,430
Don't ever get into gambling.

145
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,010
You can't keep your emotions
from showing.

146
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,470
Hurry up and tell me,
I don't have a lot of time.

147
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,890
What are you worried about?

148
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,460
It's Shi On.

149
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,670
I think I've made a mistake.

150
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,860
I've been treating him like a child.

151
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,290
You can't help that.

152
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,660
When Park Shi On first came here,
he was very childish.

153
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,470
In the beginning, that was true.

154
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:29,330
I think I believed that he would
stay like that forever.

155
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,750
Because most people with Shi On's
condition are like that.

156
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,250
That's what I was thinking.

157
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,550
Shi On is an adult with feelings, too.

158
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,470
So...

159
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,140
Is that why you are upset?

160
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm upset, and I feel sorry.

161
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,070
Did Park Shi On say something to you?

162
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,630
No, it's not that.

163
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,800
As his pride grew,
I think he was getting hurt by me.

164
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,210
I guess he could have felt that way.

165
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,890
But...

166
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,070
If you didn't take care of Park Shi On the way
you did, he wouldn't be where he is now.

167
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:29,040
Your fondness for Park Shi On is
what enabled him to change.

168
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,790
As Shi On changes,
you can change little by little, too.

169
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,720
You shouldn't be too worried.

170
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,680
I think Shi On is really ready now
to do well on his own.

171
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,070
Even if I don't take care of him
by his side.

172
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,860
We are going out for team dinner later.
Where should we go?

173
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,150
I want to rest today.

174
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,830
Go without me.

175
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,090
You're going to skip out
on team dinner?

176
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,980
It happens...

177
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,990
Congratulations.

178
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,950
In a month, you will be the
new chairwoman.

179
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,440
I will be your subordinate, then.
Since, I will still be the vice president.

180
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,600
There was no need to pull
Professor Kim Do Han into this dirty business.

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,420
I wasn't pulling him in.
I was offering him a partnership.

182
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,610
I heard you were trying to use
Dr. Park Shi On as a marketing tool.

183
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,690
I wasn't using him,
just helping him to fulfill his talents.

184
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,800
For the future of Dr. Park Shi On.

185
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,090
I don't think it was right for you
to do that to Dr. Park Shi On.

186
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,130
Weren't you using Chairman Jung
to get what you want?

187
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,270
To regain the foundation that
your stepmother took over?

188
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,600
We'll be walking the same path
from now on.

189
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,470
Let's get rid of these
bad feelings between us.

190
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,340
- They want him to leave that hospital, too?
- There's no more available treatments.

191
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,750
And there are no other surgical methods.

192
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,750
Transfer him to the Boston area.
I'll be there next month.

193
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,940
What if they tell us to leave, too?

194
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,740
Let's transfer him there, first.

195
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,140
Joon Young is having a really hard time.

196
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,060
We'll just go back to Korea.

197
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,430
Even if you come here,
there's nothing that the hospitals can do.

198
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,630
Cheers!

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
You guys all worked hard today.

200
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,420
Good job.

201
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,130
Dr. Han, congratulations on your
first surgery.

202
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,500
Thank you!

203
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,700
We had great teamwork today.
We worked quickly.

204
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,990
It feels a bit empty without
Dr. Cha around.

205
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,010
I know.
She's the QTD of our department.

206
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,900
- What's QTD?
- Queen of Team Dinner!

207
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,290
That's what the juniors call her.

208
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,000
I thought her nickname was GGB?

209
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,880
How did you know that?

210
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,460
What's that?

211
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,030
GGB?
What's that?

212
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,910
Is it a name of a town?

213
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,720
It's not that...

214
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,270
- I don't know what kind of a god it is...
- Don't say it.

215
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,270
God-given body.

216
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,610
But the important thing here is that...

217
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,430
it's not what others call her.
She calls herself that.

218
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,950
Here.

219
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,770
Good job.

220
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,820
Good job!

221
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,040
Cheers!

222
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
I keep getting mosquitoes in my ears.

223
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,330
<i>One step</i>

224
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,300
<i>When even one step is hard to take</i>

225
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,320
<i>Because I know the weight of that step</i>

226
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,920
<i>To my friend, to my love</i>

227
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,640
<i>Trust me</i>

228
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,670
<i>Two steps, I can't block the wind</i>

229
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,570
<i>But I can walk with you</i>

230
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,330
<i>To my friend</i>

231
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,630
Did you visit your father?

232
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,630
Not yet.

233
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,640
You didn't go,
or you couldn't go?

234
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,710
You don't like getting your pride hurt
or getting embarrassed, right?

235
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,670
No, I don't.

236
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,270
Do you know how you really
damage your pride?

237
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,630
Lacking in abilities?

238
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,480
Not making a lot of money?

239
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,220
No.

240
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,140
Forever being fearful of something
that you once feared.

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,540
It applies to our job,
and to life in general.

242
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,500
A lot of people are mistaken.

243
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,180
They think not experiencing fear
means they're courageous.

244
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,650
Isn't that courage?

245
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,580
No.

246
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,970
Having courage doesn't mean
that you don't feel fear.

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,600
Courage is doing something
despite being fearful.

248
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,960
Did you have a good dinner
last night?

249
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,550
Yes.

250
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,720
Professor Kim Do Han bought us beef.

251
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,840
He must have spent a lot of money.

252
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,270
Did anything funny happen?

253
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,430
No, not really.

254
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,790
I'll be in the operating room.

255
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,820
Isn't Chairman Jung
the chairman of West Hamson Fund?

256
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,210
I guess you know him.

257
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,050
I heard he specializes in investment and

258
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,200
M&A of American hospitals and
pharmaceutical companies.

259
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,030
But...

260
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,610
what's important is not that he's
the chairman for West Hamson Fund.

261
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,300
It's his relationship to the
late chairman of the board.

262
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,170
The late chairman?

263
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,420
Yes, about 15 years ago

264
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,450
when Chairman Jung was the regional director
of West Hamson's Southeast Asia office...

265
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,560
he tried everything he could to
acquire our hospital and foundation.

266
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,200
He was much more aggressive
than now.

267
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:51,040
The late chairman went through an ordeal
trying to stop that.

268
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,510
He was successful in the end, but he was
diagnosed with liver cancer soon after.

269
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,490
It seems that Chairman Jung already has a
new chairwoman picked out for the foundation.

270
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,020
He says it's somebody young
and talented.

271
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:19,690
Does Chae Kyung know the truth
about Chairman Jung?

272
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,250
No.

273
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,920
Chairwoman Lee and I didn't tell her
anything about him.

274
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,340
We didn't want to hurt Chae Kyung.

275
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,330
I'm the one who stopped the
financial sponsorship to the hospital.

276
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,020
As the first step in making
Chairwoman Lee step down.

277
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,290
- You...
- Yes.

278
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,430
I'm going to become the
new chairwoman.

279
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,870
How are you any different from the
vice president?

280
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,120
Let's say that the vice president is on
their side. What about you?

281
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,180
Why are you doing this
to your family?

282
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,390
Can you stop saying that
she's my family?

283
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,160
I'll define who my family is.

284
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,530
Fine, you do that.

285
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,530
But...

286
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,600
Stop associating with Chairman Jung.

287
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
The deal's already been made.

288
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,080
I can't stop now.

289
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,930
Do you even know who
Chairman Jung is?

290
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,770
I know him better than you do.

291
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
How did you get to know him?

292
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,220
I need to explain that to you?

293
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,480
Just tell me.

294
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,300
I was introduced to him.

295
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,320
By someone that my father's
friend knew.

296
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,280
How can you trust that man
and partner up with him?

297
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,340
He's the only one who listened to me.

298
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,610
Nobody cared why I was having
such a hard time.

299
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,940
Nobody cared why I was so mad
for such a long time.

300
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,160
Everyone always just believed that
I would get over it someday.

301
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,470
Even you.

302
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,740
I can't get over it.

303
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm not as strong as everyone thinks.

304
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,130
All those times that you spent alone...

305
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,570
It would have been nice if you
shared some of that time with me.

306
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,150
I sound like a problem child
putting the blame on her teacher.

307
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,100
Chae Kyung.

308
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,710
Listen carefully.

309
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,750
Dr. Cha.

310
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,800
Yes?

311
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,130
You've been looking down for the
past few days.

312
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,050
Me?

313
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,130
I'm not feeling down.

314
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,100
Don't I look like a well-mannered lady
now that I'm so quiet and calm?

315
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,860
I don't care if you don't look mannered,
you should be loud like usual.

316
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,490
It doesn't look like you are taking care
of Shi On like you used to.

317
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,290
He's doing well on his own.
I don't need to look after him.

318
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,860
His father is around, but he's
not someone he can count on as family.

319
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,730
There may be other things in the future
that he might get hurt over as well.

320
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,240
Dr. Han.

321
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,650
Worry about yourself.

322
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,490
<i>Now do you understand?</i>

323
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,360
<i>What kind of a man
Chairman Jung is?</i>

324
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,100
You've partnered up with someone who
led your father to his death.

325
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,500
Yoon Jung, does it hurt a lot?

326
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,130
It doesn't hurt as much
as it did last night.

327
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,750
Thank you, Doctor.

328
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:37,640
Thanks to you, I can continue
to guide my father around.

329
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,710
If I'm not around, it's hard for my father
to even cross the street.

330
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
Yes.

331
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,350
You're such a good girl,
Yoon Jung.

332
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:55,190
Is your father healthy?

333
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,470
No.

334
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,010
He's very sick.

335
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,470
Oh, no...

336
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,940
You should love him more
if he's sick.

337
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,930
How can I love him?

338
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,200
Like how I did today.

339
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,630
Like what you did today?

340
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:25,590
I had the heart to live because I thought
I would never see my dad if I died.

341
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:42,020
It's spread all throughout his body.

342
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,870
Do you know how to read this?

343
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,900
- Yes.
- It's too late.

344
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Even chemotherapy won't be helpful now.

345
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,620
The only thing we can do now
is to prescribe him painkillers.

346
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,110
Does he know?

347
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,090
Yes, I think he got tested
six months ago.

348
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,050
But, he doesn't know that
it's this serious.

349
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,420
<i>Courage doesn't mean
that you don't feel fear.</i>

350
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,380
<i>Courage is doing something
despite being fearful.</i>

351
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,270
That hurts!

352
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,930
Why is the needle so thick?
It hurts!

353
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,270
It's all finished.

354
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,830
It hurts...

355
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,020
Why does it hurt so much?

356
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,340
This kid...

357
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,580
You are showing up now?

358
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,680
You weakling...

359
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,360
Passing out and losing consciousness...

360
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,750
You better get over here!

361
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,400
My son...

362
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,610
Did you hear that I have
a big illness?

363
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,970
Then, of course, my doctor son
will cure me.

364
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,020
No?

365
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,780
Answer me!

366
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,640
I...

367
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm not an E.N.T doctor.

368
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,190
I can't cure you.

369
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,980
You call yourself a doctor?

370
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,610
You're here through the
director's influence.

371
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,960
But...

372
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,090
do you get paid?

373
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes.

374
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,090
Then, you should pay for the hospital bills,
and take care of me here.

375
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,970
I'm the father who gave you life
and raised you.

376
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,300
No?

377
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,310
Am I correct or not?

378
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,230
You're right.

379
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,280
Right...

380
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,810
That's a good boy.

381
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,040
You're a smart and good boy.

382
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,970
It hurts a lot.

383
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,360
It keeps getting worse.

384
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,510
I've been waiting for a month to
get an appointment with Dr. Kim Do Han.

385
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,530
That's nothing.

386
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,280
I had to wait for two months.

387
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,160
What's this?

388
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,990
What are you doing here?

389
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,350
Hello.

390
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,060
How can you be relaxing out here
when you are a first year resident?

391
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,940
Is your father a good father?

392
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,790
What are you talking about?

393
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,510
In this world, there are a lot of things
to be envious of.

394
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,740
I keep having more and more.

395
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:05,180
I wish my father would be
proud of me.

396
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,840
Even if everybody else ignores me,
I wish that my father would be proud of me.

397
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,840
And I wish I could be proud of
my dad, too.

398
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,900
Did something happen between
you and your dad?

399
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,140
It's nothing.

400
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,310
I'll be going.

401
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,090
Hey!

402
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,480
Yes?

403
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,720
Get something to eat.

404
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,790
It's okay.

405
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,530
I have money, too.

406
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,690
If an adult gives you money,
you should accept it.

407
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,370
Thank you.

408
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,020
He seems very strange today.

409
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,790
Here?

410
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,390
No.

411
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,450
- Do you feel pain anywhere?
- No.

412
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,250
There's no place that hurts.

413
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,890
Hello, Doctor.

414
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,340
Yes, are you Dong Jin's mother?

415
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,240
Yes, I'm finally getting
to meet you.

416
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,780
I run a store in Jeju Island.

417
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,360
I haven't been able to come.

418
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,440
I know.

419
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,910
His aunt has been taking
good care of him.

420
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:44,480
Can he be discharged the day
after tomorrow?

421
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,790
Yes. Everything has healed,
and there's nothing else that's wrong.

422
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,210
Thank you, Doctor.

423
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,460
You want to go home, right?

424
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,230
Yes, I want to go home,
and stay with mom everyday.

425
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,050
You're so lucky.
I want to go home soon, too.

426
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:09,040
I really don't want to stay in the hospital.
I'm so sick of it.

427
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,860
But, what's the first thing you want
to do when you get home?

428
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,180
I just want to be with my mom
everyday.

429
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,640
I want to see my dad,
and I want to see my sister, too.

430
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,960
When I get discharged, I'm going to
eat pork and drink cola.

431
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,950
I can eat 10 servings!

432
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,980
- I know...
- Piggy!

433
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,990
What's wrong?

434
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,600
I think I'm getting indigestion
from what I ate this morning.

435
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,230
Is somebody inside?

436
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,060
Oh, it's you, Dong Jin.

437
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,970
Did you vomit?
I think I heard something.

438
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,860
No, I just had something
stuck in my throat.

439
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,480
I was just coughing.

440
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,040
Hello.

441
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,440
What is it?

442
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,520
Shi On.

443
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,930
I...

444
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,640
I'm your mother.

445
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,720
I'm your mother.

446
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,570
I'm sorry, Shi On.

447
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,520
For not telling you.

448
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm sorry.

449
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,820
I'm so sorry.

450
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,580
<i>I'm sorry, Shi On.</i>

451
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,630
<i>I'll come find you later.</i>

452
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,280
Mommy...

453
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,310
Mommy...

454
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,010
Mom...

455
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,430
I don't like my mom.

456
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,870
Shi On.

457
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,610
My mom left a letter,
and abandoned me.

458
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,920
She left without me.

459
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,610
Shi On...

460
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,140
My mom was bad.

461
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,860
She was bad, just like my dad.

462
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,920
I'm sorry.

463
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,120
I'm really very sorry.

464
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,260
I...

465
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,890
I don't need a mom.

466
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,550
Is there anything else you need?

467
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,690
Not at all.

468
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,150
Your fluids are all finished.

469
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm going to the nurse station.

470
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,640
She must have bought a new wallet.

471
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,060
This is her cellphone number...

472
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,330
Na Hee Ra?

473
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,080
Yes, Ms. Park.

474
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,780
I'll look for him.

475
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,460
Okay.

476
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,670
Dr. Park.

477
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,750
Yes.

478
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,300
What is it?

479
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,450
I heard you met your mother.

480
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,370
Yes, I did.

481
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,220
Are you okay?

482
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,790
I'm okay.

483
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,510
But, I don't really want to see her.

484
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,310
Why not?

485
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,370
You wanted to see her a lot.

486
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,880
Yes.

487
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,250
But, I remembered that she
didn't love me.

488
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,640
When I saw my father,
I remembered that he used to hit me.

489
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,810
But when I saw my mother, I remembered
how she abandoned me and I was left alone.

490
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,810
I hated my mom back then.

491
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,500
I know how you feel.

492
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,810
But, you should listen to
your mom, too.

493
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:53,940
No.

494
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,200
You don't need to worry about it.

495
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,170
<i>I rub my trembling hands</i>

496
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:18,320
<i>I bite my dry lips</i>

497
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>But the tears that burst keep seeping out</i>

498
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,900
<i>So all day, I kept crying</i>

499
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:39,630
<i>I kept whispering out your name,
but there was no answer</i>

500
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:46,680
<i>My hands reach out to you,
but it's only an empty seat</i>

501
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,960
<i>I held onto my aching heart
and cried and cried</i>

502
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:01,200
<i>But I don't have the
confidence to melt you down</i>

503
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,830
<i>My heart aches</i>

504
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,440
<i>I am crying again</i>

505
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,400
<i>As I hold my torn heart alone...</i>

506
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,590
Are you going home?

507
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,510
Yes.

508
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,090
Get home safely.

509
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,250
Shi On!

510
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,890
You can tell me the truth.

511
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,110
You are upset because of
your mom, right?

512
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,900
No.

513
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,720
If you're upset, you can tell me.

514
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,380
If I'm upset about something...

515
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,150
I will talk to Professor Kim Do Han.

516
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,520
I love you, too.

517
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,610
Very much.

518
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,850
As my junior and as a friend.

519
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:24,540
That's love, too.

520
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,250
- I'm serious.
- That doesn't make any sense.

521
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,800
Why don't you believe me?

522
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,230
Hey...

523
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,360
What are you doing in here?

524
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,800
Kids aren't allowed in here.

525
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,190
Get out.

526
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,730
Now.

527
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,310
Get out.

528
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,420
Let go.

529
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,910
- Get out.
- I said, let go!

530
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,940
You call this a convenience store?

531
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,560
What's with your outfit?

532
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,960
How did you find out about this place?

533
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,250
How long were you going to
keep it a secret?

534
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,510
Did Dr. Han tell you?

535
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,710
He knew about it, too?

536
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,280
I saw your business card
inside your wallet.

537
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,050
Forget everything!

538
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,800
I don't want to get healthy
at the cost of making you do this!

539
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,020
In Hye.

540
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,030
What's this?

541
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,600
What the heck is this?

542
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,710
In Hye!

543
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,480
Na In Hye!

544
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,280
Where did you go this late
in the evening?

545
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,100
What is it?
Is something wrong?

546
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,460
Why didn't you tell me?

547
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,030
- About what?
- In Young's job.

548
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,340
You see...

549
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,110
You're worse than her.

550
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,290
In Hye!

551
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,210
Stop!

552
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,840
Dong Jin!

553
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,890
- Are you okay?
- Dong Jin!

554
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,200
- Open your eyes.
- Dong Jin!

555
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,540
Hey!

556
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,100
Wake up!

557
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,370
Get up!

558
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,940
Hey!

559
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,360
He's supposed to get discharged tomorrow.
What's wrong with him?

560
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,790
Dong Jin!

561
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,360
Try to wake up!

562
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,790
What's going on?

563
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,730
He vomited up bile ten minutes ago,
and he's been in pain.

564
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,760
Now, he's in a state of
unconsciousness.

565
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,460
Run a blood test and
take a CT scan.

566
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,320
What's going on, Doctor?

567
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,900
We need to run more tests
to find out.

568
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,070
It's intestinal obstruction.

569
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,420
After getting the surgery for
pancreatic pseudocyst, he got synechia.

570
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,400
It's small, but necrosis has
formed already.

571
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:18,080
He must have had pain
starting at least a week ago.

572
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,580
No, even up until yesterday, he didn't
complain of any pains.

573
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,810
Dr. Park, arrange for an operating room.

574
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,850
Okay.

575
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,360
I'm sorry.

576
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,500
It's not as critical a mistake
as you think.

577
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,650
Intestinal obstruction is discovered late
in many cases.

578
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,700
It will be okay if we
have the surgery now.

579
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,830
It's my fault that this happened
to Dong Jin.

580
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:04,330
If I had discharged him without knowing,
it would have been even more dangerous.

581
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,640
And I've done wrong to you
who performed the surgery.

582
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,800
Stop talking nonsense,
and get inside.

583
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,790
Let's go in.

584
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,220
Gauze.

585
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,070
Suction.

586
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:21,970
Dong Jin.

587
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,790
You really didn't feel any pain?

588
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,280
Tell me.

589
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,210
I was in a lot of pain.

590
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,440
And I kept vomiting.

591
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,150
Then, why didn't you tell anyone?

592
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,520
I didn't want to have to
stay in the hospital.

593
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,320
If I told them it hurt, then
I would have to stay in the hospital.

594
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,250
I wouldn't be able to go home.

595
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:57,150
I wanted to go home,
and stay with mom, dad, and my sister.

596
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,590
If it hurt that much,
you should have told the doctor.

597
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,990
I'm sorry.

598
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:08,980
Did you tell your mom?

599
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,560
- That you were keeping your pain a secret?
- No.

600
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,430
Can you keep it a secret?

601
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:18,850
Mom will be mad at me.

602
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,030
Please, Dr. Park.

603
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,420
I'm sorry.

604
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:33,000
How can you do this?

605
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,000
If this happened after we went home,
what would have happened?

606
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,760
I can't just let this pass.

607
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,600
If I keep quiet,
something like this will happen again.

608
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:52,450
For the sake of other children,
people like you should get punished.

609
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,880
His mother must be very upset.

610
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,230
Whatever she does,
I have nothing to say.

611
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:31,880
Don't worry too much.

612
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,510
It's not malpractice.

613
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,160
It's just a small mistake.

614
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,300
If there's a problem,
I'll take care of it.

615
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,580
I know that I can make mistakes.

616
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,190
Mistakes are bound to happen.

617
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,310
But, this time...

618
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:51,920
my focus as a doctor
was blurred.

619
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,660
I put Dong Jin in danger.

620
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:58,330
Your focus was blurred?

621
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,230
Cha Yoon Seo?

622
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:04,800
I guess that happens to me, too.

623
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,580
I wonder how Dr. Cha is doing.

624
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,410
I know.

625
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:19,180
Dong Jin's mom was going around
saying she's going to call reporters.

626
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,890
I can understand that she's upset,
but I'm so worried about Dr. Cha.

627
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,730
What is it?

628
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:29,870
Look.

629
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,480
Why is he bowing down to her?

630
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,520
Do you think he caused trouble?

631
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Thank you.

632
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,080
Excuse me.

633
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,760
Mrs. Cha.

634
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,550
Is Dr. Kim Do Han around?

635
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,650
Yes.

636
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:03,710
What is it?

637
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,350
What am I supposed to do?

638
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,310
I can understand that you care
for your junior.

639
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,830
But, you shouldn't be doing this.

640
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,310
What do you mean?

641
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,740
I heard that it was this
resident doctor's mistake.

642
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,770
He was aware of Dong Jin's condition,
but he says that he forgot to report it.

643
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,690
Yesterday, I saw Dong Jin
vomiting up bile.

644
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,510
I should have reported it to
Dr. Cha right away.

645
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,220
But, I forgot to report it.

646
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,350
It's my fault.
I should take responsibility.

647
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,800
That's why Dr. Cha couldn't
diagnose the condition.

648
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,340
Dr. Park...

649
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:02,470
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.

650
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:12,170
Listening to the other mothers in the ward...
They say he's a hard-working doctor.

651
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,900
I don't want to ruin a young doctor's
future, either.

652
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:25,600
I'm still angry, but I
won't pursue this any further.

653
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,490
Please take care of the remainder
of Dong Jin's treatment.

654
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,620
Why are you doing this?

655
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,720
This was my fault!

656
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,010
No.

657
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,550
It was my fault.

658
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,660
You think I will feel better
if you do this?

659
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,640
Why are you making me into a fool?

660
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,780
I'm not trying to make you into a fool.

661
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,900
Then what?

662
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,890
Are you making a sacrifice for me?

663
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,590
Sacrifice...

664
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,930
I don't know about that.

665
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,780
Fine.

666
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,380
I know you are doing this for me.

667
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,010
I know that well.

668
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,720
That's why it makes me more
upset and angry.

669
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,770
Why do you have to do this
because of me?

670
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,640
You're going through
more hardship than me.

671
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,580
I'm not having a hard time.

672
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:38,970
Shi On.

673
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,620
You should think about yourself
more than you think about me.

674
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,330
It's okay for me to make a mistake,
but not you.

675
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:56,070
What you did today didn't help
either one of us.

676
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,040
I can understand that you did
that for Dr. Cha.

677
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:33,060
But, you shouldn't take on
someone else's burden like that.

678
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,620
Especially, if you didn't do
anything wrong.

679
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,760
No.

680
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,040
The director once told me.

681
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,030
Sometimes you have to take on other's burdens
even if you didn't do anything wrong.

682
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,410
Why are you trying to take responsibility
for something you didn't do?

683
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,970
I wanted to console her.

684
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,020
Console her?

685
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,400
Yes.

686
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,990
Until now, I've only been receiving
consolation and care.

687
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,520
That's why I was so grateful.

688
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,360
I wanted to help others
and console them, too.

689
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,090
But, I couldn't do that.

690
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:17,880
I really wanted to do that when I got
smarter and more acknowledged by others.

691
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,040
I don't think Dr. Cha was
very appreciative.

692
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,620
Console her with sincerity.

693
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,120
Nothing grand.
Just a sincere consolation.

694
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,220
The warm and small consolations
you've been receiving in your life.

695
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,560
Did something happen?

696
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,460
No.

697
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,110
It's not anything new
for me to be drinking alone.

698
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:57,940
It is something new that you are
so depleted of energy and weak.

699
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,420
You should eat something, too.

700
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,860
You'll harm your health.

701
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:10,000
<i>Even if I lack a lot</i>

702
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:16,460
<i>There is one person who loves you</i>

703
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:22,950
<i>I can't express my love to you with words</i>

704
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:31,610
<i>Even if you add all of the world,
it's not enough</i>

705
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:39,300
<i>Until my tears dry,
until my heart wears out</i>

706
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:49,780
<i>The love that I want and long for is you</i>

707
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,500
What are you doing here?

708
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,490
I'm just standing around.

709
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,730
Why?

710
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,200
I thought you would be upset.

711
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,870
I'm standing around
because I'm worried.

712
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,850
I did wrong.

713
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,980
I'm sorry for making you mad.

714
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:27,600
But, that was the only thing
I could do.

715
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,760
I don't like to see you hurt.

716
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,230
I hate it more than hurting myself.

717
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,460
Shi On.

718
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,520
That's because you like me.

719
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,050
There's nothing I can do for you.

720
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,030
Except for saying thank you.

721
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,810
I'm okay even if you don't
do anything.

722
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,410
What I did today has nothing
to do with my feelings for you.

723
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:11,050
I just wanted to console you.

724
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,220
With all of my sincerity.

725
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,560
I thought you would feel uneasy.

726
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,080
That's why I was staying away
from you.

727
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,230
But today...

728
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,090
I couldn't do that.

729
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:39,630
Don't be too hurt.

730
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:46,160
What happened to Dong Jin
is not your fault.

731
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:51,970
Don't do this anymore.

732
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:58,390
I'm upset and going through a lot.
Why are you doing this to me?

733
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:05,190
<i>I'm sure that day will come,
the day when I can love</i>

734
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,980
<i>If I hope and hope</i>

735
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:14,860
<i>Do you know how it feels</i>

736
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:19,350
<i>To love someone so much
that you hate them?</i>

737
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:25,440
<i>You don't know, this foolish me</i>

738
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,930
<i>If I take a step closer,
you get farther away</i>

739
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:37,130
<i>Don't you know how I feel?</i>

740
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:41,208
<i>I love you</i>

741
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:44,211
<i>You'll look for me some day...</i>
