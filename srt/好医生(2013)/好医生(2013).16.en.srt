00:00:-4,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Good Doctor</i>

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:03,380
<i> Episode 16 </i>

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,600
Who are you?

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,350
Yeong Seo. Yeong Seo.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,620
Doc. It's that guy.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,210
That guy!

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,910
Are you the guy who made her like that?

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,520
Mister, you are really a bad guy!

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,580
Y... y... you are truly a bad guy!

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,870
Take Yeong Seo and leave!

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,520
Professor.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,810
Hurry, Park Si On!

13
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,650
Help please! Help!

14
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,660
Professor!

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,280
Professor.

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,140
What have we here?

17
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,210
If you get on your knees right now, I'll at least let you live.

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,750
If you do anything stupid...

19
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,900
Then you're going to die.

20
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,920
Did you get it, you bastard?

21
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,050
Come to your senses, Professor!

22
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,630
Are you all right?

23
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,620
Don't make such a fuss, I'm fine.

24
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,730
How is his condition?

25
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,420
According to the results of the examination,
fortunately, there's no damage to the organs.

26
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,450
The stab wound is slightly angled that there is only damage to the abdominal walls.

27
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,730
It's really a relief. It could have been much worse.

28
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,920
How could you jump in so recklessly?

29
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,800
Dr. Park was more reckless than I was.

30
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,110
You were great, Park Si On.

31
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,420
What about the culprit?

32
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,260
S... Senior Nurse!!

33
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,250
You should have stayed at home instead of coming here.

34
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,450
No... What... What the heck happened?

35
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,510
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,410
For now, I think you need to go with him.

37
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,630
But, he caught the culprit. Where do you have to take him like a criminal?

38
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,100
It's okay. Let's go.

39
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,840
No. I'll go with you.

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,040
No, you can just stay here.

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,480
How can I just stay here?

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,940
Police Officer, let's go.

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,520
You are not hurt?
- No.

44
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,600
Are you still shaking?

45
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:38,240
It's the first time I ever hit someone.

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,010
How did it feel to hit someone?

47
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,550
When I saw heroes hit the villains in movies, it felt good.

48
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,330
So, I thought I would feel good after hitting a bad person.

49
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,330
It isn't like that.

50
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,920
There's something called unavoidable violence.

51
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,200
In a situation like today, I mean.

52
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,150
If no one took on that discord, we wouldn't
have been able to catch that criminal.

53
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,020
But you absolutely can not use violence
that's intentional or without reason.

54
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,560
Your conduct today was appropriate.

55
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,480
But you... What if, as I'm walking at night, I'm completely surrounded by gangsters...

56
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,620
What will you do? Will you stay still?

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
The thugs are trying to do something bad to me.

58
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,770
"Ah! What are you doing? What do I do?"
 You're the only one around. What will you do?

59
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,710
This is what I'll do.

60
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,810
What?

61
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,490
"How many cavities do you have?"

62
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,370
What?

63
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,050
"I run a pawnshop."

64
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,770
"I accept gold crowns."

65
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,890
"After pulling out the gold crowns, I'll chew you up."

66
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,450
That's from the movie Ahjussi.

67
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,440
What if that gangster has an implant?

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,650
(My thoughts) didn't go that far.

69
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,540
Stop watching movies, please.

70
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,030
That's when you're supposed to fight.

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,310
With more power.

72
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,640
How did you find out?

73
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,770
Dr. Han told me.

74
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,890
That kid. Needlessly.

75
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,130
Do you always have to make me find out too late like this?

76
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,050
I didn't want you to worry.

77
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,600
If I found out later,

78
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,450
you knew instead of worrying I would have been angry first.

79
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,730
It's not a big deal.

81
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,370
Then, what is considered a big deal?

82
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,100
If something bad happens to you,

83
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,870
have you thought about how I would feel?

84
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,750
I have a prayer I say.

85
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,490
Since God took my father and mother away early,

86
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,540
to allow the people I have left to stay with me for a long time.

87
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,730
I don't know about other times, but
when it's a serious situation, think a bit about me.

88
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,510
I understand. I won't do it again.

89
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,530
I don't believe you. What you said.

90
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,350
Yeong Seo. Now you really don't have to be worried.

91
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,170
Understand?

92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,280
The bad guy was punished a lot.

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,450
By all of us.

94
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,220
Yeong Seo.

95
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,400
You have more good people than bad people next to you.

96
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,240
So, from now on you don't have to be worried.

97
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,730
Doctor.

98
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,670
Is that doctor all right?

99
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,030
Ah, the professor?

100
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,890
He's fine.

101
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,750
That doctor was like my dad.

102
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,710
My dad.

103
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,750
I see.

104
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,120
We'll be like your dad and uncle.

105
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
Geez, they should say something that makes sense.

106
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,840
When you caught the criminal for them,
what, excessive defense?

107
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,630
Well, that's what the law says. What can I do?

108
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,070
Don't worry.

109
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,540
If they go on about punishment or something,
we'll take measures at the level of the association.

110
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,600
I mean, where is another nurse like this?

111
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,710
It's been a while since I've been questioned that I feel like my stomach is a little empty inside.

112
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,200
Wh... wh... what do you want?

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,940
Meat?

114
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,140
But, Senior Nurse.

115
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,250
Yes?

116
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,550
How did you fight so well?

117
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,350
Especially with someone wielding a knife.

118
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,030
Well, it just happened.

119
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,620
Do you have a black belt or something?

120
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,430
No, I just used my fists some around
the neighborhood in the old days.

121
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,090
Even then...

122
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,310
I... have something I am suddenly curious of.

123
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,040
What is it?

124
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,990
Because earlier, when you were writing the report, I saw

125
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,390
the two Chinese characters for "Joeng Mi" from your name Jo Jeong Mi,

126
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,850
they were the same Chinese characters used to spell rice mill (jeong-mi-so). What does your name mean?

127
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,450
You're right. They are the characters
used to spell rice mill.

128
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,940
Huh?

129
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,770
When my mom was in full term...

130
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,840
She went to the rice mill to grind some rice
 and gave birth to me there.

131
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,460
She wasn't able to go to the hospital, so a town grandma who helps during birth giving came.

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,150
And my dad ended up naming me "Jeong Mi."

133
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,700
Why are you laughing at the name of someone's precious son?

134
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,350
I won't laugh.

135
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,820
But, Chief Nurse...

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,260
Rather than taking measures at the level of the association... Could you first...

137
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,080
Yes, first...?

138
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,790
Couldn't you first clear me of the false accusation
of sexually harassing you?

139
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,940
Yes?

140
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,070
Let me think about it first.

141
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,140
Eat some.

142
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,840
Eat.

143
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,680
I will.

144
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,720
Why?

145
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,200
Ouch! (scratchy)

146
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,270
Why did you do that?

147
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,300
I'm so thankful about what happened yesterday,

148
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,560
and congratulations on coming out of the police station.

149
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,660
But why a peck on the cheek?

150
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,990
You kissed me when I officially became a resident last time.

151
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,800
It seems like you like it this way that's why I did it too.

152
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,140
I don't exactly like it, but it feels weird.

153
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,220
Dr. Park.

154
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,390
Don't do that to me. I don't like it.

155
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,210
You received your first kiss from a guy.

156
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,850
How would you know if that's my first kiss or not?

157
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,280
The troublemaker... the Assistant Director is here.

158
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,610
What was going to happen has happened, that's all.

159
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,070
Rather, just overlooking it is better for us.

160
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,720
But think about all the things Seongwon Foundation went through to cultivate this hospital.

161
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,630
You're worrying over all sorts of things.

162
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,860
Just don't think about anything and quietly stay still.

163
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,500
Why?

164
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,550
Are you sad about the thought of being a branch director just flew away?

165
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,660
You... that was an old story...

166
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,150
Why would you say that?

167
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,560
This time, get in the right line.

168
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,760
Because West Emerson is precise
 with their personnel management.

169
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,770
What line...

170
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,420
A surgeon should be just good at performing surgeries.

171
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm going.

172
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,450
What's wrong with him?

173
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,810
I thought it was just a rumor but it turns out to be true.

174
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,910
They say the Assistant Director is
 a person from the company taking over.

175
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,340
He stabbed the Director and Chairman Lee's back properly.

176
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,700
But then, isn't that a good thing for us?

177
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,170
There will be a pediatric surgery center, and later if the whole hospital becomes a children's hospital.

178
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,270
The number of staff will increase, too.

179
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,580
They say they'll convert it to a for-profit hospital,
didn't they, if legislation passes later.

180
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,020
A for-profit hospital?

181
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,800
Yes, do you know what that is?

182
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,880
Yes, I read it in a news report.

183
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,870
You won't be able to be treated if you don't have money.

184
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,470
Especially the children's treatment fees will become expensive so the parents will have a hard time.

185
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,840
There aren't only bad points.

186
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,900
It's possible to treat patients
 in a somewhat better environment.

187
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,120
Be it a good thing or not, it is not something we could judge.

188
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,750
We are just saying this on a doctor's perspective and there should also be the patient's perspective.

189
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,500
Then, the announcement must have been sent out on the messenger because of this.

190
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,910
That everyone above assistant professor level is supposed to come to an emergency association meeting.

191
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,400
It shouldn't be. It shouldn't really be.

192
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,110
Professor, what are you doing not going home?

193
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,850
No need. With just this.

194
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,160
You can't since it's to tiring. You can't do surgeries right now.

195
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,480
I can still see patients, so don't worry.

196
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,750
Why don't you rest, just like Dr. Cha says.

197
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,090
No need, I said.

198
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,610
These punks talk so much.

199
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,990
He should be resting.

200
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,580
What now?

201
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,050
Is our hospital... really being taken over?

202
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,540
What about the Director and Chairman Lee?

203
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,210
I also don't know that well.

204
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,910
What if, after we're taken over, the Director leaves...?

205
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,710
Then I guess there's no need for me to be in this hospital.

206
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,840
Then I will follow you out.

207
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,020
Let's think about that later on.

208
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,170
Don't let the juniors get shaken because of this situation.

209
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,310
Yes, don't worry.

210
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,220
<i> We are sorry to notify you
 that we are unable to handle this case.</i>

211
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,340
<i> According to our pediatric department
 the new medical procedure is too risky for this patient.</i>

212
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,520
<i>So we recommend that you discuss this issue with Dr. Cha Yoon Seo </i>

213
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,490
<i>at Sungwon University Hospital in South Korea.</i>

214
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,700
<i> Dr Cha has been consulting with us regarding this case</i>

215
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,290
<i> and I believe she has found the best possible solution.</i>

216
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,690
Cha Yoon Seo.

217
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,240
I'm pretty sure there's a risk.

218
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,620
Should I have researched it more before sending it?

219
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,370
I too am not getting the gam* yet.
<i>(feel, sense / persimmon)</i>

220
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,330
I too am still not getting the sagwa either.
<i>Sagwa = apple or apology</i>

221
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,010
Ugh...

222
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,440
Why?

223
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,010
Did you do that just now to be funny? Gam sagwa?
<i> Gam sagwa = Persimmon apple or feeling of apology</i>

224
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,450
It's not funny, huh?

225
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,160
Yes. (It's not)

226
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,910
Sorry.

227
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,860
I ask you to take special care.

228
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,290
True, we only issued instructions about the conclusion
 and were not concrete about the process.

229
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,430
Maybe the hospital in Boston also finds it hard.

230
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,820
For now, we will have to request the cooperation of the Taeheung University Hospital professor who examined this child.

231
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,250
Since I'll give him a call, you go and
get the material from him now.

232
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,900
Yes, I will go now.

233
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,510
Hello.

234
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,760
Are you going somewhere?

235
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,330
Yes, I'm going on an errand for Doctor Cha
 to Taeheung University Hospital.

236
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,130
I see...

237
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,470
It's become cold outside suddenly.

238
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,520
You should dress warmly and go out.

239
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,690
I have to go get them at Taebaek.

240
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,550
I didn't bring a single jacket.

241
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,420
Before you do your errand, can you give me just 30 minutes?

242
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,620
Oh...

243
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,320
Where are you going?

244
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,450
I... I'm alright.

245
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,940
Don't feel burdened.

246
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,590
Just think of it as your older sister buying for you.

247
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,320
Come on.

248
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,240
This is too wide.

249
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,680
The Director told me...

250
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,900
not to be indebted to strangers.

251
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,210
Am I such a stranger?

252
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,250
Oh. This is nice.

253
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,800
It's handsome, isn't it?

254
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,070
It suits you well.

255
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh my! Didn't I take so much of your time?

256
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,810
No.

257
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,250
Thank you so much.

258
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,850
Thank you, Dr. Park.

259
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,140
For saving Professor Kim Do Han.

260
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,750
It's nothing.

261
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,690
You're going to be late. Hurry and go.

262
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,810
Thank you.

263
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,820
Yes, this is Cha Yoon Seo.

264
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,960
I saw that you sent the material on the VP shunt patient
 to the Boston Children's Hospital.

265
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,710
How do you know that?

266
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,190
That email came to me.

267
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,650
I heard you're not the Assistant Director anymore,

268
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,300
yet you receive those reports.

269
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,660
Of course, I should receive it.

270
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,250
The patient is my son.

271
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,540
The surgery method that Doctor Cha suggested to America...

272
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,820
was rejected... because there was too high a risk.

273
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,850
That there's too high a risk...

274
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,740
Doesn't that mean that it's impossible.

275
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,960
As it states, there's a lot of risks but it's not impossible.

276
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,880
Even the hospital in America refused to operate...

277
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,770
Would it be possible here?

278
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,930
You seem to think poorly of our pediatric surgery's standards.

279
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,860
Objective differences do exist clearly.

280
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,450
Then there's no need for me to be seated here.

281
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,950
Discuss it with that hospital.

282
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,700
How can something like this happen?

283
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:48,640
But, why do you think the Boston hospital rejected the surgery?

284
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,490
They probably felt a greater danger than we did.

285
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,000
And another thing,

286
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,430
If the patient is not American, there can be complications if a medical accident occurs.

287
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,250
I don't think this is a case that they should fear that much..

288
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,960
Don't be too confident.

289
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,540
They could have discovered a variable that we didn't see.

290
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,850
What if other hospitals refuse this surgery as well, not only Boston hospital?

291
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,410
The assistant director would probably take care of the next step.

292
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,700
I came back.

293
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,080
Yes. Did you receive all the documents?

294
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,500
Yes.

295
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,530
Wait a minute!

296
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,170
This is a piece of clothing that I haven't seen.

297
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,160
Ah, yes..

298
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,250
Did you go shopping while running the errand?

299
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,280
What is this?

300
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,790
Wow, so embarrassing. You should at least take this off.

301
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,580
$875!

302
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,430
What?!

303
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,260
This clothing is that expensive?!

304
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,400
What is this? You didn't buy it?

305
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,260
Ah, I... well, the thing is...

306
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,370
Just because she said she would buy it for you, you just accepted this expensive clothing?

307
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,210
I didn't know the price.

308
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,180
I didn't know it was the price of 972 triangle kimbaps.

309
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,870
And I kept telling her that I didn't want to buy it.

310
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,360
In any case, you wore it in the end.

311
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,280
Am I right or wrong?

312
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,350
You should know to decline an excessive favor.

313
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,200
Am I right or wrong?!

314
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,890
And you...

315
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,820
If you need clothing, you should have told me!

316
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,170
Why did you go to the General Manager for no reason?

317
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,090
Wait a minute here, Doctor.

318
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,790
It was wrong of me to openly receive this expensive clothing.

319
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,540
But, why you are getting so angry...

320
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,870
I don't really understand the reason.

321
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,600
Hey!

322
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,240
I was just worried that you might hear upsetting things from other strangers...

323
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,220
General Manager Yoo is not much of a stranger...

324
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,580
Yes. If you say so, then I guess it isn't.

325
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm sorry for getting angry.

326
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,350
The doctor, she's pissed off.

327
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,600
As for sacrococcygeal tumor, the line where it meets the colon is unclear, and

328
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,580
because it's pressing on the nerve that goes down through urethra and the legs,

329
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,230
I expect the surgery will be a little difficult.

330
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,920
If the surgery goes well, is complete recovery possible?

331
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,170
The prognosis will depend upon the biopsy result after extracting the tumor,

332
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,920
but if it turns out to be benign, complete recovery is possible.

333
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,080
I came here all the way from Gangwon-do because I was told it would be difficult.

334
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,870
Please take good care of him.

335
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,840
Yes, I will do my best.

336
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,840
Thank you.

337
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,990
<i>The suspect who's wanted for the so-called "Yongbong-dong Don't ask Bloodshed" incident</i>

338
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,390

So on the day Park Si On's father came, it was a chaos.

351
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
Now, we also have to worry about Park Si On's father.

352
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,830
I am so annoyed.

353
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,750
But, why are you so curious about Park Si On all of a sudden?

354
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,730
Huh?

355
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,240
What do you mean... "why"? He's our resident's... maknae.

356
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,540
I heard that you even went to his house.

357
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,860
Huh?

358
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,970
I did go with him.

359
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,430
Family visitation.

360
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,710
What?

361
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,100
Good work for bringing these documents. Now, you can leave.

362
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,630
Yes.

363
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,330
But, Chief...

364
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,430
I have something to ask you on a personal level.

365
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,810
What?

366
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,960
What is it?

367
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,430
Nothing.

368
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,930
I will be leaving.

369
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,310
What a silly dude.

370
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,890
Joo Nam.

371
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,630
This hospital has the most successful doctors in all of South Korea.

372
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,650
Now, you can have your surgery and get fully healed.

373
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,100
So, don't worry too much.

374
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,720
I understand, Dad.

375
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,110
It's that way.

376
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,360
Excuse me.

377
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,450
Do you perhaps know where Park Si On is?

378
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,710
Are you talking about Doctor Park Si On?

379
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,940
This.. this.. this... doctor. What do you mean by "doctor"?

380
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,210
How did you get here...?

381
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,870
I am his father! Si On's father!

382
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,190
Where did he go?

383
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,820
Thank you for looking after our Yoon Jeong.

384
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,080
This is small, but please take it.

385
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm sorry.

386
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,670
We are not allowed to accept presents.

387
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,380
It's nothing big.

388
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,300
This is our best. So, please accept it.

389
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,560
No.

390
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,290
If you do this, it puts me in an very uncomfortable situation.

391
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,020
You are Yoon Jeong's life savior.

392
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,070
Just think of it as our heart and please accept it.

393
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,780
I'm really sorry.

394
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,140
I will just accept your kind intentions.

395
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,800
Then, I understand.

396
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,780
Thank you for all you have done so far.

397
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,090
Please go back safely.

398
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,310
Yes.

399
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,450
Si On!

400
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,130
This jerk...

401
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,840
After talking back to your father...

402
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,090
Now, you don't even reveal yourself.

403
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,920
But, you know... After what I've heard,

404
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,570
That "don't ask me" culprit or whatever,

405
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,290
Did you hit and capture him?

406
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,370
Yes, we all captured him.

407
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,400
This guy...

408
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,410
I guess you've inherited my fighting genes.

409
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,420
We can't fool blood relations.

410
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,250
It's different from you hitting me.

411
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,940
I only hit a bad guy.

412
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,820
But you hit Mom and me.

413
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,840
What? You brat!

414
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,090
Pardon me.

415
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,250
I am the Chief of this department. But, are you perhaps Doctor Park's father?

416
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,270
That's correct.

417
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,490
Oh.

418
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,850
Dr. Park, hurry to the NICU

419
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,780
and check up on the new premies.

420
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,470
But, what?

421
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,480
Go.

422
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,780
Hurry.

423
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,310
Ah. Yes.

424
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,850
Si On. While your father is talking, where are you going, Si On?!

425
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,780
Excuse me.

426
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,390
This is Dr. Park's place of employment.

427
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,330
Even though you are family, please don't visit this area without any specific reasons.

428
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,390
Ah, but this hospital is always like "Don't meet him".

429
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,710
"Don't visit him". I can't even see my own child?!

430
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,080
You are being really funny!

431
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,130
Look at that, you are sick.

432
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,580
I told you not to perform the surgery.

433
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,810
Don't talk to me.

434
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,510
You deserved it, not listening to your hoobae's words.

435
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,210
I need to at least be hurt like this.

436
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,080
While hurting other people's feelings,

437
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
I didn't even know anything.

438
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,640
I guess you resolved things with the General Manager.

439
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,950
You did well!

440
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,250
Yoon Seo,

441
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,290
Yes?

442
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,490
You were always there when I needed you. Always looking after me.

443
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,290
Thank you

444
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,990
For teaching me what it means to really comfort others.

445
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,770
How could you ... ?

446
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,830
Is that true?

447
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,180
Yes.

448
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,710
I am the one who stopped the funds.

449
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,290
I'm also the one who gave our financial information to CEO Jeong.

450
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,920
No matter how much you hate me, how could you?

451
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,370
Are you, by any chance, the new chairman that CEO Jeong had in mind?

452
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,190
Is that you?

453
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,020
It's already a foundation that will be passed
 on to you. Why are you so pointlessly-

454
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,080
If I had just known the fact that Chairman Jeong was the person that made father pass away,

455
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,220
something like this wouldn't have happened.

456
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,960
Forget it. Leave.

457
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,420
I don't want to look at your face again.

458
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,820
I'm sorry, ahjussi.

459
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,430
I ... will definitely set things right.

460
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,850
Definitely.

461
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,530
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,790
We made you like this.

463
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,230
It's not your fault.

464
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,930
Ahjussi.

465
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,020
I hope you would recognize just one thing.

466
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,660
The foundation, the hospital,

467
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,210
there won't be any lingerings even if we lose them.

468
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,290
With that kind of thing, whether it's me or Chairman Lee,

469
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,490
it's merely a small part of us.

470
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,660
But, losing you is like losing everything.

471
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,580
Your father will probably be thinking the same thing.

472
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,440
I'm leaving first. Work hard.

473
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,860
Goodbye.

474
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,900
Park Si On.

475
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,770
Are you a stalker?

476
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,340
Why are you chasing me so creepily?

477
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,370
I thought that you seemed upset,
so I wanted to relieve your anger.

478
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,270
What am I upset for?

479
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,810
You were upset before.

480
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,870
You're making me seem so petty. When did I?

481
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,730
The decibels are still high right now.

482
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,290
Alright.

483
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,930
Let's say I compromised with you
one hundred times and was still upset.

484
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,240
How are you going to relieve that?

485
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,450
Well...

486
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,190
What?

487
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,860
You guys. I don't like you lately.

488
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,490
Now that you've been doing some weird
things, are you doing body gags, too?

489
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,980
If I've relieved your anger, that's enough.

490
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,660
But you,

491
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,770
do you know what I've actually become so upset about?

492
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,950
I saw it on the internet.

493
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,110
That the most difficult question that women throw at us since the civilization started is,

494
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,140
"Do you know why I'm angry?" It said that.

495
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,090
Please tell me.

496
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,610
I don't know, either.

497
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,240
If you don't know, then who does?

498
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,160
I know, right.

499
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,250
Whatever the case, it's because of me.

500
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm sorry for making you angry.

501
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,640
He always says he's sorry.

502
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,950
Do you not need to go to the hospital?

503
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,230
I will go then.

504
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,210
Go quickly!

505
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,410
Yes!

506
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,270
Oppa.

507
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,190
I heard it from the Director.

508
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,410
I heard you confessed to Chairman Lee.

509
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,860
Let's go. Let's go and die together.

510
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,310
Aigoo, this is the first time I've seen the madam drunk.

511
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,520
Why, uncle? Am I not allowed to get drunk?

512
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,850
Why wouldn't you?

513
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,860
Professor Kim is here, too. Just go all the way today.

514
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,690
I thought I was smart.

515
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,740
Is that not true?

516
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,070
You're smarter than me.

517
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,990
What's the point of that?

518
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,630
I've completely been had, and I've become a fool.

519
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,520
A total fool.

520
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,100
I look pathetic to you too, right?

521
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,270
I always make a ruckus saying I'll handle it by myself,

522
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,120
but I never do one thing properly.

523
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,300
You do make a ruckus,

524
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,100
but there are more times that you do things properly.

525
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,780
Kim Do Han!

526
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,820
What?

527
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,370
Why are you acting so much like a lover all of a sudden?

528
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,400
Of course I'm your lover, am I an
adolescent from your neighborhood?

529
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,540
It's because I'm getting scared that
you're being like this all of a sudden.

530
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,140
I'm afraid that you'll become cold again after being like this.

531
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,230
I'm afraid that you'll be alone again.

532
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,780
Dr. Park Si On said that.

533
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,880
That you always eat alone and you don't smile that much, either.

534
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,490
I was like that, too.

535
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,960
I wish all of the good memories would return soon.

536
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,430
At the time when I liked all people ...

537
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,390
Those warm memories?

538
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,370
I would like to tell you my opinions about my son's surgery.

539
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,290
Among both of you,

540
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,030
one of you go to Boston, please.

541
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,790
I understand what you're trying to say,

542
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,110
but the people over there still won't perform the surgery.

543
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:35,380
And we are not participants. We only
have the right to become simple advisers.

544
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,770
Please bring him to our hospital.

545
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,550
We know very well that you don't trust
 our Pediatric Surgery Department.

546
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,690
The choice is up to you, Assistant Director.

547
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,890
It's not that I can't trust you. It's just that
 I trust that side a little bit more.

548
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,990
Seongwon University Hospital, the Pediatric
 Surgery Department's capabilities,

549
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,820
I know them better than anyone.

550
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,450
However,

551
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,350
it's a bit early for me to trust you.

552
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,580
That's why I wanted to reform it.

553
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,450
To create a hospital that I was more one
hundred percent sure about than anything else.

554
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,530
Do you think a patient's trust

555
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,980
can be gained by only investment and reform?

556
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,020
What good does it do to have a good system and facility?

557
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,460
If we can't do surgeries for them at the most needed time?

558
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,070
<i>We too have no intention of performing a surgery without the guardian's trust.</i>

559
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,250
<i>I believe this is beyond our control,</i>

560
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,080
<i>so I sincerely wish you luck.</i>

561
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,500
Hello.

562
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,530
Yes, hello.

563
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:18,130
Assistant Director. You're bad.

564
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,650
I heard.

565
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,020
That you're trying to convert

566
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,210
our hospital into a for-profit hospital.

567
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,660
I also know what that means.

568
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,120
It will make the children and parents' lives more difficult.

569
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,820
If they have no money, they can't even get a proper surgery.

570
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,690
There are two sides to everything.

571
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,060
I believe the matter at hand is not much different, Doctor.

572
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,560
That is not so.

573
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,090
Even if we have good equipment and a good facility,

574
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,190
if the patients can't come, there's no use.

575
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,400
It gets sadder if they die because they can't come.

576
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,450
When the chance to live gets taken away,

577
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,810
it gets even sadder.

578
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,040
Say it again.

579
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,410
In Hae.

580
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,040
This means the donor of my small intestine is

581
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,020
you.

582
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,640
Then it means you're giving me yours.

583
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,260
They say it's the safest way.

584
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,660
Are you crazy, Unni?

585
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,170
You worked your butt off for me, and now you're giving me your intestine?

586
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,600
I'm okay.

587
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,450
So, In Hae...

588
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,050
Forget it!

589
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,870
I don't need a surgery or anything.

590
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:59,790
I'm just going to die! I'm just going to die!

591
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,890
In Hae! In Hae!

592
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,910
In Hae!

593
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,400
In Hae!

594
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,640
Don't come.

595
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,660
I'm going to be here alone.

596
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,570
In Hae.

597
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,850
I told you not to come.

598
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,430
Why did you

599
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,970
not tell me in advance?

600
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,900
I, too,

601
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,360
thought there was some other donor.

602
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,670
Look.

603
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,660
It's not an urgent surgery,

604
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,100
so if you would wait just a little more...

605
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,180
Please don't say anything.

606
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,630
Professor.

607
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,120
They say In Hae's surgery has been scheduled.

608
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,660
Why was In Hae's surgery scheduled?

609
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,530
They say Chief Kim from HPB scheduled it.

610
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:11,380
Chief Kim?

611
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,680
Why didn't you tell us anything?

612
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,070
Na In Young wanted me to keep it secret.

613
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,690
Then you should've told us at least right before you scheduled the surgery.

614
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,460
You did find out eventually.

615
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,870
In Hae.

616
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,530
She's a patient whom we have been continuously monitoring.

617
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:25,420
So?

618
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,270
We must participate in the surgery as well.

619
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,240
Intestine transplant.

620
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,500
You don't have much experiece of it.

621
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,760
I don't have much, but I've never failed at it, either.

622
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,550
You can't do that when you've only done a few.

623
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,710
I have to be in full charge of this surgery.

624
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,400
If I have your department in it,

625
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,870
I'll get distracted, so it can't happen.

626
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,440
In Hae's condition is different from any other short gut syndrome.

627
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,380
Intestine barely exists, so we need to come up with another surgery method until right before the transplant.

628
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,870
Are you lecturing at me?

629
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,590
That I might do the surgery without even knowing that...

630
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,960
Are you worried?

631
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,350
I'll take care of it on my own,

632
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,590
so you just stay put.

633
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,040
What were you thinking coming here so thoughtlessly?

634
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,460
I'm sorry.

635
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,510
We had no options over there,

636
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,930
and Joon Yeong wanted to come to Korea, too.

637
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,570
Then you should've called me in advance
 at the airport, not here.

638
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,150
Dad.

639
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,530
Yes.

640
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,050
You must be tired coming all the way here.

641
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,360
Dad.

642
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,910
I heard they could cure me here.

643
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,350
I hope it will happen for sure.

644
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,560
So I can play baseball again.

645
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,940
Yes.

646
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,060
I'll make that happen.

647
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,730
I'm going to have him admitted just for the time being.

648
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,110
Until I find other alternative.

649
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:45,020
Please do as you like.

650
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,390
Thank you for your understanding.

651
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:50,260
Let me ask just one question.

652
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,140
I thought, by observing our pediatric surgeries until now,

653
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,250
you would have more than enough reasons

654
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,240
to know our ability.

655
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,240
You even told us you trusted us.

656
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,050
I don't understand why you distrust us now despite all that.

657
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,040
The reason is simple.

658
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,020
Because

659
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,980
I'm his father.

660
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,970
There's no father in the world

661
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,210
who would put his own child at the risk of uncertainty.

662
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,180
Honey.

663
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,510
You don't say anything.

664
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,610
Are you

665
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,110
Dr. Cha Yoon Seo?

666
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,450
Do you know me?

667
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,630
Yes.

668
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,930
My mom showed me the email you sent her.

669
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,270
A way to do surgery.

670
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,740
I see.

671
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,720
You're much prettier than I had imagined.

672
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,290
Thanks.

673
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,950
Doctor, you will do my operation, right?

674
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,040
Please promise me.

675
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,540
After seeing your letter, I pestered
my mom to come back to Korea.

676
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,250
Why is everyone set on his or her way?

677
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,490
If there's a better solution they should pick that one.

678
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,450
Please calm down.

679
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,520
If something happens to the kid, each will try
to avoid blame or harm probably.

680
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:40,490
There's nothing we can do. Everyone thinks
 his or her choice is the right one.

681
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:55,170
No matter how much I learn about the world, there are too many hard things.

682
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,880
There are hard thing for me too. The older I get...

683
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:08,030
I don't know why people only believe in their thoughts and not listen to others.

684
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,240
A disease does not hurt the person...

685
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,250
A person hurts the person more, I think.

686
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,060
Not even a doctor can fix that.

687
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,870
For a virus, there's a vaccine and for a tumor, there's an anti-tumor agent.

688
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:27,880
There is no remedy for a person that hurts others.

689
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:32,550
You're right but the only remedy is another person.

690
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,100
I wish doctor could fix diseases and people.

691
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,450
You are doing that.

692
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:45,210
All those children with wounds that we saw...

693
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,960
They all got discharged because their hearts were healed.

694
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,710
Not because of the treatments but because you reduced their pain by giving them love.

695
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,420
Love... reduced... pain?

696
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,230
That's why you're a good doctor.

697
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,440
I still don't know what a good doctor is.

698
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,530
A good person.

699
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:15,410
I think a good person becomes a good doctor.

700
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,300
Oh! That's why you're a good doctor.

701
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,240
No. I'm still a doctor who's about to become good... or not.

702
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,830
No, you're wrong. If I say you're wrong then you're wrong.

703
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,020
Are you my fan-club president? Your praise is too much.

704
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:38,140
I'm your bba, a "do-anything-for-you fan". Cha Yoon Seo's bba (die hard fan).

705
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,850
Stop spending so much time on the internet. You speak more and more weird language as the day goes by.

706
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,910
Dr. Park, haven't you seen In Hae?

707
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,050
I didn't. Did she go somewhere?

708
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,350
A short while ago, she must have come to her hospital room and, while I was not around, changed into her clothes and gone out.

709
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,870
I will go outside right now to look for her.

710
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,330
In Hae.

711
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,220
Why are you here?

712
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,530
Did you come out as you pleased again?

713
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,630
You shouldn't be here.
Let's hurry back into the hospital.

714
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,010
I don't want to.

715
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:46,470
Today, I just really don't want to be at the hospital.

716
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,960
Yes. I understand.

717
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:03,330
Dr. Cha has taken her and will bring her tomorrow.

718
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,900
Don't worry too much, Miss In Yeong.

719
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,490
Ta da!

720
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,200
That's the bathroom. Go take a bath and disinfect yourself.

721
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,670
Inside there's a disinfecting solution.

722
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,390
Yes.

723
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,600
Excuse me, Respected Elder Sister.

724
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,820
Yes, Doctor?

725
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,080
Dr. Cha will look after her very well.

726
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:03,750
Yes, of course, she would.

727
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,540
In Hae should be mad and hurt now but...

728
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,370
She will understand your heart.

729
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:13,070
In Hae seems more mature than me.

730
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:15,430
She is a child with a large heart.

731
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,240
And, Respected Elder Sister...

732
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,470
It's kinda weird being called Respected Elder Sister just...

733
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,830
Please just call me In Yeong.

734
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:27,980
Ah, yes.

735
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:31,330
In Yeong... excuse me but...

736
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,520
Dr. Han Jin Wook likes you a lot.

737
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,050
He sleeps above me in the night-duty room bunk bed.

738
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,190
He rolls over every night.

739
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,770
He's too loud for me to fall asleep.

740
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:49,300
So I also stay up all night.

741
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:55,350
I thought I was the biggest idiot inside this hospital but..

742
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:59,180
Han sunbae was behind me.

743
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,690
He's really, really a dummie.

744
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,590
Dr. Han told me this:

745
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:12,120
"There's no qualifications necessary to love someone, and if you love that person sincerely without any condition,

746
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:16,090
you develop the qualifications necessary
 for just that person."

747
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,840
I, Respected Elder Sister, that is, In Yeong,

748
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,020
would give Han Sunbae a certificate of qualification.

749
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:32,360
So that he can carry in around in his heart, not his wallet.

750
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:42,180
Have you not thought about how your sister
would be happier to let you get your surgery?

751
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,190
Why would she be happy?

752
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:47,930
She can't even fall in love or get married.

753
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:51,210
No. She can do everything.

754
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,650
It's not that serious a surgery.

755
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,740
Believe what your doc is saying.

756
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,330
How do you and your sister have such kind hearts?

757
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,270
-- Doc.
 -- Hmm?

758
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:09,410
But... didn't you refuse Dr. Park's confession?

759
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:10,510
What?

760
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,850
Because the rose is hung over there.

761
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:17,250
If you hadn't accepted his confession, you
would have thrown it away. Strange.

762
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,780
How do you know that?

763
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:25,560
Doc Park said he liked someone, so I counseled him.

764
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:29,770
But he wouldn't say who he liked no matter what.

765
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:33,680
Then, in your cell phone, I saw that.

766
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,660
That's the confession method I told him about.

767
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,690
Really!

768
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:40,590
Why are you that embarrassed?

769
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,060
No, I'm not embarrassed.

770
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,350
- Why?!
- Nothing.

771
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,620
Just. Because he confessed so earnestly,
I couldn't ignore it.

772
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:03,380
Then, it's not because you accepted his confession that you hung up the rose, but...

773
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,790
you hung it up to mean that you're not ignoring his feelings?

774
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,140
Yep.

775
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,940
I'm acknowledging him as an adult.

776
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:15,100
I thought...

777
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:20,830
Doc Park... is a very good man.

778
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:22,840
I know.

779
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:28,750
I... would like it if all the good men in this world wouldn't get hurt.

780
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:52,890
<i>♫ Because you are on my mind all day, ♫</i>

781
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,490
<i> ♫ I am all smiles while you are looking at me. ♫</i>

782
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,380
<i>♫ Because you are also thinking of me sometimes, ♫</i>

783
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,460
<i>♫ Tonight I won't be able to sleep. ♫</i>

784
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,790
<i> ♫ Loving alone and ♫</i>

785
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,930
<i>Doctor...</i>

786
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:21,930
<i>The meaning of the phrase "Love is something that eases people's suffering."</i>

787
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,970
<i>I didn't know it very well earlier today.</i>

788
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:30,250
<i>♫ Then that day will come
 that you love me. ♫ </i>

789
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,540
<i>But after I thought about it deeply,</i>

790
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:37,370
<i>there doesn't seem to be a painkiller as perfect as this.</i>

791
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,850
<i>♫ For someone who is loved so much ♫</i>

792
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,960
<i>♫ Don't you know I don't dislike it?</i>

793
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,300
<i>Thank you, Doctor. Sweet dreams. </i>

794
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,650
<i> ♫ Silly me. ♫ </i>

795
00:59:54,600 --> 01:00:01,250
...

796
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:41,010
In Hae! Hurry and wake up.

797
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,100
You have to hurry to the hospital to
get your infusion and get disinfected.

798
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,200
Just a little longer.

799
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,260
Oh? Why did you come?

800
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,700
I came to get In Hae.

801
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:07,090
There's no need for you to worry since I'll escort her well.

802
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:12,680
Look at your eye crud. Did you come,
 not having washed your face even?

803
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,610
Doc...

804
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,490
I'm...
