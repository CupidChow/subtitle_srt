<i>Episode 13</i>

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,300
Shi On.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,610
Park Shi On.

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,890
This bastard...

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,700
He hasn't changed at all.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,600
You retarded kid!

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,300
Retard!

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,720
Why did you have to be born?

10
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,380
Just die!

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,730
Die!

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,670
You damned child!

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,510
Die!

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,980
Shi On.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,620
I'm your father.

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,190
Your father is here!

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,750
Get over here!

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,760
Dr. Park!

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,180
Park Shi On, wake up!

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,260
Shi On!

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,640
You bastard!

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,990
Get up right now!

23
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,420
Shi On.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,660
Shi On, say something!

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,810
Shi On!

26
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,800
Shi On!
Shi On!

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,600
Shi On!

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,820
Park Shi On!

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,130
Shi On!

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,200
How can you lock up the child like that?

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,420
If he goes out,
he'll just put our family to shame!

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,360
How can you say that?

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,470
Please don't do this.

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,830
Get out!

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,970
I should just break his legs,
so he can't go out.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Dr. Park!

37
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,260
Dr. Park, say something.

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,440
I...

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm okay.

40
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,090
Father...

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,660
My father...

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,790
He's outside.

43
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,150
Mr. Park.

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,630
Wait...

45
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,700
This kid...

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,070
Is he in his right mind now?

47
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,520
What are you doing?

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,670
- You can meet your son later.
- What?

49
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,790
He's not in stable condition right now.

50
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,120
I'll let you see him
when he is stable again.

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,860
Who do you think you are?

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,000
- Who are you to tell me what to do?
- Dr. Park Shi On is my student.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,910
Who cares if you are his teacher?
Why are you getting involved in family business?

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,090
- Get out of the way.
- Listen to him!

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,780
Where do you think you are
causing this violence?

56
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,210
I knew it...

57
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,300
I knew it!

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,740
What are you doing?

59
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,550
I knew it!

60
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,400
I knew it!

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,490
Please calm down!

62
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,450
Who are you?

63
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,020
Let go!

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,500
Let me go!

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Let go!

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,320
Mrs. Park.

67
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,040
- Quiet down.
- You thought I wouldn't find you?

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,430
You didn't think I could find you?

69
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,320
You didn't think I
would find you?

70
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,400
You didn't think I would find you?

72
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,330
You thought I wouldn't find you?

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,400
<i>Is that what you thought?</i>

74
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,030
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

75
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,530
<i>You didn't think I would find you?</i>

76
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,040
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,840
His mother wanted to keep it a secret.

78
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,020
Still, you should have told me.

79
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,300
She was asking me so earnestly.

80
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,480
Looking at him pass out like that,
I think the trauma is worse than I thought.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,030
Still, he can't just continue
to avoid his father.

82
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,250
I don't think he will be ready
any time soon.

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,430
What about his mother?

84
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,820
We can't keep his mother
a secret from him, too.

85
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,130
You two were hiding from me.

86
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,920
You thought you would live well
without me?

87
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,020
Does it look like I'm living well?

88
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,910
How dare you stare at me
like that and yell?

89
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,090
Shi On doesn't even know who I am.
He can't even recognize my face.

90
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,170
He recognizes me.
And he doesn't recognize you?

91
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,170
You're lying to me now?

92
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,550
Just go.

93
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,950
Don't appear before Shi On.

94
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,730
Why should I leave?

95
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,560
If you need money,
I'll give you all the money I have.

96
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,070
Please just go!

97
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,040
You think I'm
some money hungry critter?

98
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,100
I spent my whole life looking for you.

99
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,580
So that I could kill you with
my own hands.

100
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,550
Good.

101
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,060
Why don't we both die together, then?

102
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,050
For Shi On's sake.

103
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,390
What?

104
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,210
Who is it?

105
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,630
Who's the one that's putting our
foundation in this danger?

106
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,420
Didn't I tell you?

107
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,490
I told you something worse would happen
if you turned down my proposal.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,630
My goal was to establish a hospital
with you and Dr. Kim Do Han at the center.

109
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,150
If the two of you are not around, the
hospital would be missing two main pillars.

110
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,150
I have no desire to work with people like you
who only have money as their goal.

111
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,250
Get out immediately.

112
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,970
Without going through the board, I am
dismissing you with the authority I have.

113
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,610
Fine.
I'll leave.

114
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,380
But, within the next few days,
I'll be back in this place.

115
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,520
I will be the one running this
hospital in the end.

116
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,230
Even now,
I still have respect for you.

117
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,110
Soon, a meeting will be called
to negotiate with you.

118
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,640
Please reconsider my proposal,
Director Choi.

119
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,680
<i>I will bring Shi On's father
to my home.</i>

120
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,000
<i>Please comfort Shi On.</i>

121
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,350
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

122
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,030
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

123
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:11,490
Did my father leave?

124
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,320
Yes, he left.

125
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,660
Does it hurt anywhere else?

126
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,910
No.

127
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,270
Your dad was very scary, right?

128
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,310
He's not scary anymore.

129
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,480
But before, I felt like I went in a time machine
and traveled back to when I was seven.

130
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,530
If you don't want to see your father,
I won't let him come for a while.

131
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,860
Shi On.

132
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:48,460
When you remembered your father's face,
did you also remember your mother's face?

133
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,400
I still can't remember her face,
but she passed by.

134
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,670
Mom was getting hit, too.
A lot.

135
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,470
I hope mom doesn't remember.

136
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,230
If she is full of wounds like me,
then she would be feeling very hurt.

137
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,140
I'll go down in a little bit.

138
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,270
I want to be alone for a while.

139
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,520
Oh...

140
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,150
Okay.

141
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,900
I think there was a lot that
we didn't know about Shi On.

142
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,440
Treat him like nothing happened.

143
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,890
Don't try too hard to cheer him up.

144
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,120
Just treat him like you always do.

145
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,620
That's what Shi On needs
right now.

146
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,240
He must have been hurt
so badly as a child.

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,740
But, his father...

148
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,360
What if he comes back here?

149
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,510
We can't let him meet Shi On, right?

150
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,910
Where have you been?
You need to prepare for the meeting.

151
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,090
Park Shi On.

152
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,590
- Get the x-ray files ready for the meeting.
- Okay.

153
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,710
Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be accompanied
by any small intestine or heart malformations.

154
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,550
Usually, a congenital diaphragmatic hernia

155
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,810
is accompanied by the conditions that
Dr. Cha just mentioned.

156
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,170
It's fortunate, but patent ductus
arteriosus is present.

157
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,870
Park Shi On.

158
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,190
Yes.

159
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,110
Tell me about the surgical methods.

160
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
Come on.

161
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,290
I don't know.

162
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,250
I can't think.

163
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,970
Then, looking at the x-ray,
which way do you think the liver turned?

164
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,710
Dr. Park.

165
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,920
I can't see.

166
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,180
I can't picture it in my mind.

167
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,920
Do you think it's temporary?

168
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,680
There's no way to tell.

169
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,190
What if his condition continues?

170
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,350
Then, he won't be able to do
anything in the future.

171
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,810
That's the only ability that
Park Shi On has.

172
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,500
How can his father...

173
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,170
I don't know how to help him.

174
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,830
How can we help?

175
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,970
There's nothing we can do.

176
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,410
Hello.

177
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,740
You are all working hard.

178
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,910
Let's see...

179
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,700
How about going out to dinner
tonight as a team?

180
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,370
We had a lot of emergencies last night,
so we have a lot of patients today.

181
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,530
I see.

182
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,720
I have a lot of premature babies to
attend to at the NICU as well.

183
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,860
I see.

184
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,600
Il Kyu.

185
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,430
I'm on call today for the ward.

186
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay, work hard.

187
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,390
Why is he talking about dinner
out of the blue?

188
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,620
Thinking about it, I think this is the first time
he's offered to go out to dinner with us.

189
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

190
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:17,340
I couldn't understand why such an
overqualified man came to work for our hospital.

191
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,670
But, maybe you have taken on the
hardest task.

192
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,420
Trying to manipulate the director
and Dr. Kim Do Han.

193
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,120
It's not something that can be
done with money.

194
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,520
Yes, you are right.

195
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,980
They are the first ones that
I failed to convince.

196
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,580
You're the one holding the key for negotiation,
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

197
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,650
I think you are the one holding the key.

198
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,300
The cancellation of the financial support
from the corporations was your doing.

199
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,280
Is that what Chairman Jung said?

200
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,320
I didn't mention
Chairman Jung at all.

201
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,680
We are on the same boat.
Let's not be like this to each other.

202
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,580
Trojan Horse...
It was the best.

203
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Have you called for the board meeting?

204
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,520
Yes, tomorrow.

205
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,820
But, there's no alternative plans...

206
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,290
How bad is the situation?

207
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,230
If this continues,
our foundation is at its end.

208
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,060
There won't be capital turnover, and
it will be impossible to run the hospital.

209
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,820
You don't know who's behind
all of this?

210
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,520
I'm looking into Vice President's people,
but I haven't found anything, yet.

211
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,080
You'll get contacted soon.

212
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,480
They'll try to negotiate with you.

213
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,700
I told you before...

214
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,750
That you should be more alert.

215
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,580
Chae Kyung.

216
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,390
I'm upset and frustrated, too.

217
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,340
How can we get attacked like this
and be so helpless?

218
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,210
You're right.

219
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,890
It's all because I'm incapable.

220
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,790
I can't tell you for certain.

221
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,670
Then, you're not sure whether
his ability will return or not?

222
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,890
No. If this is just a simple case of
disassociative identity disorder

223
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,500
time and treatment will help.

224
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,020
But his current condition is due to a
suppressed memory resurfacing after many years.

225
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,040
Even if he looks normal on the outside,
I'm sure it's had a huge impact on him.

226
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,560
It's possible to intentionally
suppress your memory?

227
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,770
It's rare, but it's definitely possible.

228
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,170
Especially for a person like Park Shi On
who is on the autistic spectrum.

229
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
There's nothing we can do?

230
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,820
There's no way to get back his
ability immediately.

231
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,550
But...

232
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,030
There is something that
may be helpful.

233
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:20,100
He needs to feel that he's being
loved and cared for by others.

234
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,470
That way, his present stability can
cover up his past traumatic experience.

235
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,330
This is so ironic.

236
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,130
It's normal not to have
such abilities.

237
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:47,450
I don't know if it's a temporary condition,
but that's how he is doing right now.

238
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,840
How long has it been since
you've known Shi On's mother?

239
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,340
It's been a few weeks.

240
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm sorry for not telling you.

241
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,730
No, it's okay.

242
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,670
You know Shi On's parents well, right?

243
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,790
I do.

244
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,270
I think you will have to
take care of this.

245
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,900
Okay.
I understand.

246
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,420
You and Do Han should
take care of Shi On.

247
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,130
Yes, Director.

248
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,280
You're scared of your father, right?

249
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,370
Then, what are you most afraid
of in this world?

250
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,890
Is that your father, too?

251
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,570
No, it's a patient's death.

252
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,310
Okay.

253
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,180
Watching a patient die
before your eyes.

254
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,130
Then, what do you have to do
to avoid seeing the patient die?

255
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,370
- I have to diagnose well and treat him.
- But, you are not doing that right now.

256
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,150
Think hard.

257
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,840
Your fear of your father may
make you kill a patient.

258
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,710
Because it doesn't allow you to
utilize your ability.

259
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,640
When you first came here,
I said this to Dr. Cha...

260
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,710
That your ability is a malfunction of the brain
and a side effect of your illness.

261
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,900
But I thought it wouldn't be bad to have
you around for the sake of the patients.

262
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,100
Malfunctions and side effects are just
standards that people hold.

263
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,310
And the most important thing...

264
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,870
You have to keep the promise
you made to me.

265
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,160
That you would surpass me.

266
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,020
Get over this quickly.

267
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,590
Don't think that time will heal everything.

268
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,750
The more you think that way...

269
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,560
the less patients there will be
for you to save.

270
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm saying this because I know the
two of you always cared for Dr. Park.

271
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,520
I feel so bad for Dr. Park.

272
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,620
I thought he was finally
getting adjusted.

273
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,370
All done.

274
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,420
I saw him before.
Where is Dr. Park?

275
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,540
You forgot again?

276
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,240
He's busy with ER calls these days.

277
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,770
Right.

278
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,610
He's a real resident now.

279
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,060
But, you really don't have a boyfriend?

280
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,230
No.

281
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,180
Why?
You want to set me up?

282
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,940
Are middle school boys okay?

283
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,750
Why would I date somebody
young enough to be my son?

284
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,150
Oh, right!

285
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,290
I wonder how Eun Ok is doing.

286
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,800
Kyu Wan sent me a picture of her.

287
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,240
Take a look.

288
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,170
Look at her smiling.

289
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,370
She must be very happy.

290
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,590
Of course.
Kyu Wan is so good to Eun Ok.

291
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,140
Dr. Cha.

292
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,650
What's with this rose?

293
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,130
Dr. Park gave that to me.

294
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,260
- When?
- A few days ago.

295
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,920
Why did he give it to you?

296
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,570
Just as a gift...

297
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,050
Why?

298
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,070
It's nothing.

299
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,320
Dr. Park ranks number one in
patient satisfaction these days!

300
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,790
Really?

301
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,120
Of course.

302
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,180
He visits the patients more often
than other resident doctors.

303
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,090
He's never made a critical mistake
in diagnosis or treatment.

304
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,860
Dr. Park is better than even
third and fourth year residents.

305
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,060
Of course, you don't need
to mention that.

306
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,740
Right, Dr. Park?

307
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,980
We are home.

308
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,530
Mom, we are here.

309
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,350
Stay there.

310
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,620
How heavy...

311
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,830
You're getting heavy.

312
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,320
Shi On, stay here.

313
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,830
Don't go anywhere.

314
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,280
Park Shi On.

315
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,830
Yes.

316
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,760
I'll give you a day off.
Go home and rest.

317
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm okay.

318
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,990
You can't even think straight.
What's the use of staying at the hospital?

319
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes, you should go home and rest.

320
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,920
You haven't been able to sleep
for the past few days.

321
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,940
Dr. Cha.

322
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,420
If he doesn't go home,
drag him out.

323
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,770
Take the key away from him.

324
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,180
Okay.

325
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,570
Why?

326
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,260
Run away.

327
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,740
Run away!

328
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,250
I won't run away.

329
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,480
Of course not...

330
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,680
Your son is working at a hospital.
Of course, you would stick around.

331
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,310
We should leave this place.
Far away from Seoul.

332
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,360
I don't want to!

333
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm going to live off of my son
in my old age.

334
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,530
He's a doctor after all!

335
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,880
- What have you done for Shi On?
- I've done plenty.

336
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,550
I'm Shi On's dad.

337
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,500
His father!

338
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,970
You haven't been a father to him!

339
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,030
Seriously!

340
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,140
It's been awhile.

341
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,640
Yes.

342
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,340
This is it.

343
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,260
This was it!

344
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,780
You two have been having
an affair all these years!

345
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,870
Please don't say that.

346
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,470
You act all noble.

347
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,130
You stole my wife!

348
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,120
Stop!

349
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,960
Please let go.

350
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,710
I won't let go!

351
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,840
Please leave Shi On alone.

352
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,620
Just watch him from afar.

353
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,290
I'll do whatever I want
with my son!

354
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,040
It's none of your business!

355
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,360
Mr. Park.

356
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,780
Was he like this as soon as he came?

357
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes.

358
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,050
He was like this in the afternoon, too.

359
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,870
Shi On.

360
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,870
What you said yesterday...

361
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,480
Please pretend you didn't hear anything.

362
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,300
How can I pretend I didn't hear
when I did?

363
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,960
I...

364
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,890
I made a mistake.

365
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,130
When I was in elementary school,
I really liked my teacher.

366
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,560
She was pretty, and she was
always nice to me.

367
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,260
You are just like that teacher.

368
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,980
It's because I'm still childish.

369
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,200
You don't need to say anything.

370
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,470
I know you are lying.

371
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,280
I don't know how to lie.

372
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,550
What you said when you
gave me the rose...

373
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,840
Telling me you are going to
the convenience store to buy a hammer...

374
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,820
They were all lies.

375
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,830
Shi On.

376
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,610
What you said to me...

377
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,340
That wasn't childish, and it's
nothing you should feel sorry about.

378
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,080
I took it sincerely.

379
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,530
If I didn't feel your sincerity,
I would have just laughed it over.

380
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,160
But, I'm not doing that.

381
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,340
By any chance...

382
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,770
am I your first love?

383
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm so thankful.

384
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,220
That you think of me
as your first love.

385
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,900
This guy I used to know at church was
my first love when I was in ninth grade.

386
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,560
Of course,
it was a one-sided love.

387
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:26,250
Just like you, when I looked at him, my heart
would beat and I wouldn't be able to sleep.

388
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,220
I was very young then.

389
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,850
I matured a lot while liking him.

390
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,720
As I ached and worked through
those pains.

391
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,340
First love makes you grow.

392
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,620
A lot.

393
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,800
You've started growing as well.

394
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,960
I love you, too.

395
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,550
Very much.

396
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,980
As my junior, and as a friend.

397
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:12,290
That's love, too.

398
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,400
For now, you may be hurt that I don't
love you as a man.

399
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,030
But when time passes,
you'll feel more comfortable.

400
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:32,640
And we'll grow closer
as if we were real siblings.

401
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,330
What if...

402
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:42,170
even after time passes,
what if that doesn't happen?

403
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,470
Even after time passes,
if I feel the same way...

404
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,780
What do I do?

405
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:59,900
I think I would feel more frustrated
than I do now.

406
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:09,170
I would feel more frustrated than
the time I was locked up.

407
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:15,650
Still...

408
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,440
I feel better that I told you everything.

409
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,610
I feel hurt,
but my heart is at ease.

410
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,550
I feel like I am bothering you.

411
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,850
Hello.

412
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,060
This kid...

413
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,080
Why are you going home,
instead of staying at the hospital?

414
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,340
Well...

415
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,690
Whatever...

416
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,200
Just go.

417
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,920
Hey!

418
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,700
Yes.

419
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,610
Do you know how to drink?

420
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,660
There's normally no manager in the
pediatrics surgery department.

421
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,000
Do you know why? Because the director
is in direct control over it.

422
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,400
Direct control.

423
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,210
Do you know?

424
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,890
You told me the same thing
eight times.

425
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,180
Then, listen for the ninth time.

426
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,290
When I came back from the branch hospital,
there was no opening position for me.

427
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,880
All of my friends were already
managers.

428
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,300
So, I got the position
thanks to my brother-in-law.

429
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,800
Why?
Are you disgusted?

430
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,300
No, I'm not disgusted at all.

431
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,320
Of course, you guys don't
respect me.

432
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,800
Especially that kid, Kim Do Han.

433
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,640
I don't have anything to say
even if he disrespects me.

434
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,590
After all, he's the youngest ever to
become a fixed member in our department.

435
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,230
I heard.

436
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,160
That it's very hard to become
a fixed member.

437
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,580
I'm a surgeon, too.

438
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,080
I've performed numerous surgeries!

439
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,220
I'm a surgeon, and a doctor!

440
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,030
But, nobody acknowledges me.

441
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,380
I respect you.

442
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,960
Shut up!

443
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,310
Who cares if you respect me?

444
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,950
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,910
For telling you that I respect you
when I'm just a lowly being.

446
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,860
I was just saying...
Don't get upset.

447
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,890
I'm not upset.

448
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,310
Stop lying!

449
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,310
You are so small-hearted.

450
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,010
Here.

451
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:44,060
Tell me where you live,
so I can tell the taxi driver.

452
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,720
Dubai.
Let's go to Dubai.

453
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,520
Since I'm a surgeon.

454
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,810
<i>What if...</i>

455
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,610
<i>even after time passes,
what if that doesn't happen?</i>

456
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,040
Even after time passes,
if I feel the same way...

457
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,120
What do I do?

458
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,270
That...

459
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,600
I don't know, Shi On.

460
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,690
I'll feel more frustrated
than I do now.

461
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:32,230
I'll feel more frustrated than
when I was locked up.

462
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,320
Still...

463
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:43,080
I feel better that
I told you everything.

464
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,460
I feel hurt,
but my heart is at ease.

465
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,310
What's this?

466
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,800
You're awake?

467
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,850
Did you bring me to your house?

468
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,020
Yes.

469
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,810
Come, and eat.

470
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,030
My head...

471
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,590
There's not much food,
but please enjoy.

472
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,570
You want me to eat this
for breakfast?

473
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:53,580
Yes, mine is tuna with mayo.
Yours is Jeonju Mix.

474
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:02,160
Thank you for drinking with me
last night.

475
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,030
When did I do that?

476
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,980
And you were really cool last night.

477
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,580
'I'm a surgeon, too!'

478
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,160
I want to do that, too.

479
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,560
This kid...

480
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,180
How is Park Shi On?

481
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,760
I don't think much has changed.

482
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,680
His dad's problem is serious, too.

483
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,470
There's another problem?

484
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,830
It's nothing.

485
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:02,030
I think you were trying to tell me
something last time, too.

486
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,790
It's nothing.

487
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,910
Explain spermocytoma to me.

488
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:21,310
Along the midline of the body... it occurs in
the primitive cell of the embryo.

489
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,880
It's the infant's...

490
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,640
cyst.

491
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,760
It's not a cyst, but a tumor.

492
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,820
Tumor.

493
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,670
Among children's tumors,
it constitutes...

494
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,670
Four...
Five percent.

495
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,060
Three percent.

496
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,580
It constitutes for three percent.

497
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,390
The embryo's primitive cell...

498
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,070
Stop.
That's enough.

499
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,710
Go.

500
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,380
Echo...

501
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,940
Pericard...

502
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,240
Heta vizen.

503
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,360
It's been reported to cause cholestasis,
acute pancreatitis, and hemorrhaging

504
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,920
when injected in children.

505
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,110
Drainage tube...

506
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,430
Here.
This is the part.

507
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,550
This is the location of the second and third
tracheal rings.

508
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,130
You're the doctor in charge of me,
but you don't take care of me at all.

509
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,560
I'm sorry.

510
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,380
I'm not in my right mind these days.

511
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,520
You confessed your feelings,
but she rejected you, right?

512
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,640
You're making me sad.

513
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,330
I've become strange.

514
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,720
I get annoyed easily.
And I'm lying, too.

515
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,180
What if she really starts
to hate me?

516
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,050
Dr. Cha wouldn't do that.

517
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,390
You're right.
Dr. Cha...

518
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,000
You...
How did you know?

519
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,300
If you leave clues behind,
you're bound to get caught.

520
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,990
How did you know?

521
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,130
I saw the picture of the rose
in Dr. Cha's cellphone.

522
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,160
Rose...

523
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,960
Oh, the rose.

524
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,500
I take back what I said last time.

525
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,580
I have nothing to say if
it's Dr. Cha.

526
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,790
You...

527
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,980
You really can't tell anyone.
Do you understand?

528
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,350
Don't worry. Have a seat.

529
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,390
Dr. Cha rejected you, right?

530
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,920
She says you're like her brother, right?

531
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,670
This is the worst case scenario.

532
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,930
You don't need anything else now.

533
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,300
You need to show her your true feelings.

534
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,630
True feelings?

535
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,630
That's the only weapon you have.

536
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,410
True feelings...

537
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,170
Shi On.

538
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,670
There's somewhere I need to take you.

539
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,300
I want to go.
Please let me go.

540
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,940
Shi On.

541
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,330
Your father has terminal cancer.

542
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,890
All of the tests are done.
The tumor has already spread.

543
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,180
You don't have to see him,
but you should know.

544
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,650
I know...

545
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,810
I know that you're fearful of your dad.

546
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:30,490
I know that you only have
bad memories of him.

547
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,660
But...

548
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,170
You should change the way you think.

549
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:37,630
He's not a father who used to
just hurt you.

550
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,640
He's a patient who is dying of
terminal cancer.

551
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,320
She fell on the pavement, and there
was glass shattered on the ground.

552
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,960
My daughter was trying to keep me
from falling down...

553
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,200
and she fell instead.

554
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,470
I see.

555
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,460
It must hurt a lot.
Just wait a bit.

556
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,940
I think it's going to hurt a lot.

557
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,920
Just hold still.

558
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,470
I'm sorry, my daughter.

559
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,420
No, don't worry, dad.

560
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,660
Where are you coming from?

561
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,220
I went to pay for the treatment.

562
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,460
I see.

563
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,200
You shouldn't exercise too vigorously.

564
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,540
Okay.
Thank you, Doctor.

565
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,150
But, where is your mother?

566
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,420
She went to work.

567
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,400
Your father's always had bad eyes?

568
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,770
Yes, when I was seven, he became like
that because of acute glaucoma.

569
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,200
Then, you always take him around?

570
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,510
No, only when I'm home from school.

571
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,210
My dad is a musician.

572
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,430
He writes songs.

573
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,830
I pick him up from his studio
after he's done working.

574
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,350
You are very nice.

575
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:59,590
I'm not nice.
That's my dad.

576
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,200
In the beginning, I was really upset
and ashamed.

577
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,630
But, not anymore.

578
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,050
When I imagine a world without my dad,
I get really sad.

579
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,140
I'll be going then.

580
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,850
Thank you for sewing me up.

581
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,430
Okay.

582
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,090
Bye.

583
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,040
Dad, let's go.

584
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,330
In Young.

585
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,790
Why are you here again?

586
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,200
I have to go back to the hospital,
so I'll make this short.

587
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,360
I know it may not be my business,
but I hope you'll quit this job.

588
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,890
For In Hye's sake...

589
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,700
- If she finds out...
- I won't let her find out.

590
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,020
I'll take care of my business.
And this is not such a shameful job.

591
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,260
I know.

592
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,310
But, you have to drink,
and your life patterns become irregular.

593
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,150
Doctor Han.

594
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,380
You must know how much
a transplant costs.

595
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,200
I don't have anything.

596
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,230
No matter how hard it is,
I have to bear through it.

597
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,250
Then, why don't you look for
another job?

598
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,620
If not, I can lend you money.

599
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,420
I don't care if it takes you
10, no 20 years...

600
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,940
Good for you.
That you have that much money.

601
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,390
That's not what I meant.

602
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:54,780
Find someone that fits you well,
not me.

603
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,750
I...

604
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,060
I'm not the one for you.

605
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,990
Wait...

606
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,420
Shi On, are you sleeping?

607
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,390
I'm not sleeping.

608
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,480
I didn't think so.

609
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,220
What are you thinking about?

610
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,070
Just different things...

611
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,250
You must have a lot on
your mind, too.

612
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,500
I didn't before...

613
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,940
But my head feels like
a pair of tangled up earphones.

614
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,390
Shi On.

615
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:56,210
Have you ever liked or loved someone?

616
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,630
I'm sure you have.
You are a man, too.

617
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,170
You like someone, too?

618
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,230
Yes.

619
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,000
Is it...

620
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,920
In Hye's sister?

621
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,290
I guess the rumor has spread everywhere.

622
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,680
You are fully qualified.

623
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,430
Qualified?

624
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:30,230
Yes, qualified to love someone.

625
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,530
What's the basis for that qualification?

626
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,920
Cool like you, and without any flaws...

627
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,240
Always confident,
never embarrassed...

628
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,640
And...

629
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,020
Mature like a grown-up.

630
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,170
There are no qualifications
for loving someone.

631
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,600
Instead...

632
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,280
When you truly love someone
without any conditions...

633
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,400
you become qualified to
care for that person.

634
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,550
A qualification that only that person has.

635
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:17,270
I'm going through all this heartache,
so I can earn that qualification.

636
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,260
Did you confess to her?

637
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,260
Of course...

638
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,030
Not.

639
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:25,860
That's the hardest thing in the world.

640
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:30,240
I think it's more nerve wrecking
than dissecting a cadaver for the first time.

641
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,160
You?

642
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,470
Yes, I did confess without meaning to.

643
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,470
You're better than me.

644
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,740
Park Shi On!

645
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,870
You must really love that woman
that you confessed to.

646
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,670
You're great!

647
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,890
I received a call from the vice president.
They want to meet to negotiate.

648
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,350
They want you to come out, too.

649
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,640
You...

650
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,990
It's been awhile,
Mrs. Lee Yeo Won.

651
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,220
I mean, Chairwoman Lee.

652
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,060
It was you, Chairman Jung?

653
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,290
It's been so long since we've seen
each other. Don't be so rigid.

654
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,510
You haven't changed at all.

655
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,390
Please, sit down.

656
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:50,720
We should eat first,
then we can talk.

657
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,420
What's this?

658
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,700
It's a pain killer.

659
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,200
Why are you giving me this?
I told you I'm not sick.

660
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,080
I don't need this!

661
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,210
I'm not sick!

662
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,250
I'm not sick!

663
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,760
<i>A school bus on the way to school
overturned on the way...</i>

664
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,050
<i>The majority of the students
on the bus were injured.</i>

665
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,720
<i>Driving on Olympic Highway,
around 8:30 this morning...</i>

666
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:00,780
Hae Lim!

667
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,700
Mom!

668
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,710
- We have 11 patients from the car accident.
- What's the reason for the accident?

669
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,060
The bus driver fell asleep,
and the bus overturned.

670
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,350
There were 27 on the bus,
and none died.

671
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:45,420
But all 27 are injured,
and 20 of them have come to us.

672
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,140
How can they send them all to us?

673
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,440
Other hospitals don't have the
resources, either.

674
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,280
There are too many kids. We need
to prepare for emergency surgery.

675
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,480
First, we've contacted neurosurgery
and orthopedics

676
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,690
for the nine patients with head
and bone injuries.

677
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,560
The rest are here.

678
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,090
Contact the general surgery department
for assistance. Check the patients.

679
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,130
Yes, sir!

680
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,730
Bring the central venous catheter.
Hurry!

681
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,130
It looks like hemoperitoneum.
Take a CT scan.

682
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,520
It's pneumothorax.
Take the chest x-ray.

683
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,080
It's taking longer to take the CT scan and
x-rays because of the high volume of patients.

684
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,110
Tell them it's an emergency!

685
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,050
There's excessive bleeding!

686
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,920
A blood vessel burst in the abdomen
from the trauma.

687
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,720
Surgery set.

688
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,770
There's tenderness in the abdomen
and fever. It's enterbrosia.

689
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,940
He needs immediate surgery.

690
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,320
We can't lose any more time.
Arrange for an operating room.

691
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,720
Move him.

692
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,890
There are nine patients who
need immediate surgery.

693
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,620
The manager just took one out,
so now we have eight.

694
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,510
We've arranged for nine operating rooms.

695
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,250
All the tools are ready, too.

696
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,160
Arrangements have been made
with anesthesiologists.

697
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,200
But, if we open up all nine rooms,
do we have enough doctors?

698
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,430
We've postponed surgeries in other departments,
and all their interns are on standby.

699
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:38,060
But, aren't we short on surgeons?

700
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,980
Cover three patients with your surgeons.
We'll take care of four.

701
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,530
Then, we have one patient left over.

702
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,310
Don't you know that we're short
on surgeons?

703
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,510
Transfer the remaining one.

704
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,770
- Still...
- We don't have time. Get ready.

705
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,120
Professor Kim, what should we do?

706
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,380
- Dr. Han.
- Yes.

707
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,280
You perform one surgery.

708
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,950
You can take care of the bursting of
the inferior vena cava, right?

709
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,980
Move the patients now.
Hurry.

710
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,640
Yes, sir!

711
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,450
If something comes up during the surgery,
contact me through the intercom.

712
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,750
Please send a resident to the ER!

713
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,840
Why?

714
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,320
Ho Young Hospital sent one of the patients
from the car accident to us.

715
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,330
What?

716
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,270
They didn't have enough surgeons, either.
They couldn't perform the surgery.

717
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,650
Dr. Park, I need to go into surgery.
Hurry, and go to the ER.

718
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:34,740
Okay.

719
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,010
Dad, let's go.

720
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,730
Eun Jung!

721
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,800
Eun Jung!

722
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,090
Please save her, Doctor.
Please save my daughter.

723
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,080
Yes.

724
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,620
A fractured rib bone has pierced her spleen.
There is heavy bleeding.

725
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,170
Looking at the vitals,
we don't have much time to lose.

726
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,330
First, we need to move her to
the operating room.

727
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,160
We need to move her quickly.

728
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,300
That's not a problem,
but who will perform the surgery?

729
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,690
We can move her to the room next to
Dr. Kim Do Han's room.

730
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,690
He can perform the surgery on
both patients.

731
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,690
He did that before.

732
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,040
Suction.

733
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:47,910
Gauze.

734
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,030
Get me one more.

735
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,600
Mixter.

736
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,560
Metzen.

737
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,810
Forceps.

738
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,760
- Bovie.
- Metzen.

739
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,240
Please move her quickly.

740
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,320
What's going on?

741
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,270
The patient arrived late.

742
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,880
She has multiple rib fractures
and a pierced spleen.

743
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,130
Her vitals are unstable.

744
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,500
How can you just put her
in that room?

745
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:42,490
I thought that you would be able
to take care of both patients like before.

746
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,680
Go and arrange for a nurse
and an anesthesiologist.

747
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,740
Yes, sir.

748
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,200
- Anesthesia is finished.
- Okay, I'll be there soon.

749
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,850
The vitals are dropping.

750
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,500
- There's bleeding around the liver.
- Gauze.

751
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,710
We are going to pack it with gauze.

752
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,720
- Professor Kim, what about that child?
- Wait!

753
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:30,220
The bp can't be sustained.
You need to start quickly.

754
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,280
Professor Kim.

755
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,510
Put glue on the bottom portion.
More blood transfusion.

756
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,060
Glue.

757
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,590
Professor Kim.

758
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,390
I can't leave this room right now.

759
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,350
Then, what do we do?

760
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,680
Park Shi On.

761
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,900
You perform the surgery.

762
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:54,650
What?

763
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:12,120

764
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,830
I can't do this.

765
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,690
I'm a first year resident.

766
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,000
Shi On is an adult with feelings, too.

767
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,080
I've been treating him like a child.

768
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,730
You need to partner up with a man
who led your father to his death.

769
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,380
Shut up.
You are going to use us like this?

770
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,210
I don't think you are in any position
to be choosy.

771
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:49,370
Why didn't you tell me?
You're the worst.

772
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:52,940
I don't think it's right for you
to do that to Dr. Park Shi On.

773
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,600
It's too late.
Chemotherapy wouldn't do any good.

774
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,950
It doesn't seem like you are
taking care of Shi On the way you used to.

775
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:03,350
You think I feel at ease?
Why are you making me look like a fool?

776
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:07,700
I don't like my mom.
I don't need my mom.
