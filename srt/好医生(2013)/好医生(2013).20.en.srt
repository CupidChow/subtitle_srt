00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,680
What happened?

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,400
Her breathing is not returning,
and her BP is low.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,900
In Hye.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,530
I think it's D.I.C.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,220
D.I.C?

7
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,300
- She's bleeding in her stomach...
- Then, we can't make the bleeding stop.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,590
If the bleeding doesn't stop,
she may never wake up.

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,290
Park Shi On.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,130
Go, and get the blood test done.

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,630
Now!

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,080
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,500
Do you think this is due to the side effect
of the immunosuppressant?

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,900
Let's do this for now.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,880
We have to hope that it's not D.I.C.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,910
The bleeding started two days after
the surgery.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,380
It is D.I.C.

18
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,450
And as expected, the cause is the side effect
of the immunosuppressant.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,890
Worse...

20
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,480
The concentration of the plasma fibrinogen
is too low.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,700
Then, it will make the bleeding worse.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,400
Can't we inject heparin?

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,770
No, that may lead to a more
risky situation.

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,110
What happens if the bleeding
doesn't stop?

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,420
For now, all we can do is remove
the accumulated blood

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,580
and continue blood transfusion.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,840
Um...

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,390
- We can't have another surgery?
- Not now.

29
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,730
If we have the surgery now,
In Hye's condition will worsen.

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,110
No matter what we look at,
there's a dilemma.

31
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,830
There's nothing we can do right now.

32
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,210
We can only hope that the bleeding
will stop naturally.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,490
In Hye isn't awake yet?

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,440
No, it's normal to sleep for days.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360
We don't wake them up
on purpose.

36
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,530
Nothing will go wrong, right?

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,600
Right.

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,630
Don't worry.

39
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,970
Thank you.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,330
If you weren't here, In Hye
and I wouldn't be here so comfortably.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,700
The surgery went perfectly well.

42
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,220
This is so unfortunate.

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm sorry, Director Choi.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,580
No.

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,420
I couldn't foresee this, either.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,380
Actually, the work you have to do now
is more important.

47
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,990
When there are no more medical treatments
possible, many doctors do nothing.

48
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,900
But you shouldn't do that.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,890
There's another treatment left.

50
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,620
Desperately hoping for the
patient to recover.

51
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,520
That's the last treatment.

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,290
Why In Hye?

53
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,830
She deserves a chance to be happy.

54
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,720
She's been through so much
in her life.

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,260
Like the director said,
all we can do is hope.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,250
How much more desperate
do we have to get?

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,910
We were plenty desperate before.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,740
But...

59
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,520
the world is so unfair.

60
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,110
So unfair...

61
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,490
Don't think that way.

62
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,920
In Hye will wake up for sure.

63
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,000
<i>In Hye.</i>

64
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,780
You are my friend, right?

65
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,250
Of course, I'm your one and only friend.

66
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,880
In Hye.

67
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,070
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm so sorry.

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Bastard...

70
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,130
Are you here to check if
I'm dead, yet?

71
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,980
You should have come
after I died!

72
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,580
Please...

73
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,420
He's got no affection for me.

74
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,900
Stop pretending to care.
Just do your job as a doctor.

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,210
That way you won't starve yourself!

76
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:15,220
Our department just operated on a child,
and something may go wrong...

77
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,940
She's still alive.

78
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,650
But, I'm sad thinking that
something may happen to her.

79
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,320
I still hate you.

80
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,560
I hate you a lot.

81
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,700
But if you die,
I think I will be even sadder.

82
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,040
For hating you...

83
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,750
For not liking you...

84
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Please let me like you
a little bit more.

85
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,180
So that I won't be so sad later.

86
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,990
<i>From now on,
listen carefully to what I say.</i>

87
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,570
<i>It's a way to prevent the hospital
from going over to the investors.</i>

88
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,210
Did you visit the Garden Chase Bank?

89
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,840
Yes.

90
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,380
I applied for the loans
with the information you gave me.

91
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,400
Within this week, you must apply
at the two additional banks.

92
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,940
They will grant the loans
as well.

93
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,850
How can you guarantee that?

94
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,170
People think that foreign banks have access to
domestic bank information, but that's not true.

95
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,930
That's why they tend to trust
minor league players like me more.

96
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,920
All three banks must know that
West Emerson is our creditor.

97
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,710
All three banks are rivals to
West Emerson.

98
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,050
They wouldn't want West Emerson
gaining market in Korea.

99
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,690
They probably know that you work for
Chairman Jung as well.

100
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,460
They do, but they have no choice
but to listen to me.

101
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,810
That's how people are...

102
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,440
More than listening to their own people.

103
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,720
They tend to listen to traitors
on the opposite side.

104
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,410
The shrimp survives by putting the
whales to fight each other.

105
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,500
I'm not so sure...

106
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,480
why you want to help us.

107
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,550
I'm not sure, either.

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,160
Please execute this well.

109
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,700
Seriously...

110
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,740
She was always showing off...
and she dates a guy like that?

111
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,640
I guess she likes unique people.

112
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,220
It sounds like the
world is coming to an end.

113
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,910
Why are you sighing?

114
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,730
What bastards!

115
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,740
I should crush them...

116
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,980
Those are my words...

117
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,280
You should only say nice words.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm fine, but I don't want people to
talk badly about Dr. Cha.

119
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,300
Dr. Park, you are a true man.

120
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:05,710
If they say that again,
bring them to me.

121
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll let them have a piece of me.

122
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,950
No matter what,
we are all on your side.

123
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,970
Be strong!

124
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,940
That's too bad...

125
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,940
Other than a blood transfusion,
there's nothing else you can do.

126
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,550
No, there's no other way.

127
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,700
Can you come to our gathering
this weekend?

128
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,030
Maybe.

129
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,410
Everyone knows that you
have a boyfriend.

130
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,720
I texted them.

131
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,350
They want to see him.

132
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,990
They don't even know what
kind of a man he is...

133
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,470
What kind of a man?

134
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,420
That's not what I meant.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,960
I'll be at the gathering
with Dr. Park.

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,030
Yoon Seo, there's no need to
bring him.

137
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,010
He's someone I'm dating.

138
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm sure Dr. Park will want to go, too.

139
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,480
I don't want to!

140
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,260
Why?

141
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,700
- I just don't want to!
- What do you mean?

142
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,130
You must have a reason.

143
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,820
There's no reason.

144
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,170
You lack confidence that much?

145
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,010
How will you be able to date me
if you dislike yourself so much?

146
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,100
Why...

147
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,120
Why can't you understand
my position?

148
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,730
I do.

149
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,730
I do understand.

150
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,520
Fine.

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,530
Do as you wish.

152
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,050
I won't force you.

153
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,050
<i>Desperately hoping for the
patient's recovery...</i>

154
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,090
<i>That's the last treatment.</i>

155
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,280
Yes?

156
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,580
Do Han.

157
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,190
Can we meet later?

158
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,420
If that's what you want,
of course.

159
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,300
Then, let's go somewhere together.

160
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,860
You can pray.

161
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,620
Close your eyes.

162
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,740
Put your hands together.

163
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,710
Okay.

164
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,720
Listen.

165
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,430
Yes...

166
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,850
After I die...

167
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,140
Will the food at my annual
memorial service taste good?

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,910
Damn...

169
00:13:52,030 --> 00:14:00,220
How would I be able to eat anything when
there's no one to run the memorial service?

170
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,120
Damn...

171
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,370
I will stay with you,
and live forever as a child.

172
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,310
No. You need to live happily
with everyone here.

173
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,470
<i>[God Given Body]</i>

174
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,990
<i>There's only one bridge of fate
between the two of you.</i>

175
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,560
<i>If that bridge disappears,
you'll never get back together.</i>

176
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,760
No...

177
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,190
No...

178
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,750
Oh my, that was quick.

179
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,510
You should have been this
efficient from the beginning.

180
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,470
This is strange...

181
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,180
- I see some of my own talented men here.
- Talented men? They are all trash.

182
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,490
What?

183
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,670
What's this list?

184
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,010
This is the list of doctors who received
rebates from pharmaceutical companies.

185
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,740
Those are the ones I am aware of.
I'm sure there are more.

186
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,820
But...

187
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,740
why are you giving this to me?

188
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,540
In order for the hospital to run smoothly,
we need to get rid of the weeds.

189
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,850
I was one of them.

190
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,770
I'll accept any punishment
you have for me.

191
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,820
You traitor!

192
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,840
Stop telling me what to do!

193
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,210
Before I am your brother-in-law,
I'm a surgeon!

194
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,310
A surgeon from the
pediatrics department of SWU Hospital!

195
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,210
- What? How dare you...
- Get a hold of yourself!

196
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,200
You think anyone can become
a chairman?

197
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,500
Just treat my sister well.

198
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,010
I have to go in for a surgery.
I'm going.

199
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,540
Hey!

200
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,530
Hey...

201
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,580
If you betrayed me for a reason,
I would punish you.

202
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,360
But that's not it.

203
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,390
Why did you do this?

204
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,690
You better tell me now.

205
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,610
You are not losing out.

206
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:51,100
You will get your money back for the
bonds that you purchased.

207
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,940
You think that makes any sense?

208
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,240
You ruined my plan of 15 years.
Right in front of my nose!

209
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,990
You told me once.

210
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,780
That children are our hope.

211
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,980
Hope that's just a bit different.

212
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,700
My reason is a simple one.

213
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,460
You can't do that with children.

214
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,770
What?

215
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,880
If you want to bring a legal suit
against me, go ahead.

216
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,620
I won't evade it.

217
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,830
Hey!

218
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,120
Kang Hyun Tae!

219
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,460
You better come here!

220
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,320
Why aren't you taking my calls?

221
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,310
I didn't hear because
it was on vibrate.

222
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,880
You've become such a good liar.

223
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,750
You were that offended by
what I said?

224
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,180
I wasn't offended.

225
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,090
I just needed to think.

226
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,610
Why do you have so much
to think about?

227
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,550
You and I are like Peter Pan and Wendy.

228
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,510
We lived in two very different worlds.

229
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,530
That's why there are so many difficulties
for us to be together.

230
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,990
So what?

231
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,460
You're going to take me home like Wendy,
and never see me again?

232
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,190
Why are you getting so angry?

233
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,490
You weren't like this before.

234
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,050
This is different from before.

235
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,800
We are no longer just friends.

236
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Maybe it was better back then.

237
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,270
I was right.

238
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,270
People do think you are strange,
and they talk badly about you.

239
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,580
I can't stand to see that!

240
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,090
Why do you have to hear that
because of me?

241
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,170
Who?

242
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,140
Who said those bad things?

243
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,290
They can say whatever they want!
I don't care!

244
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,420
My...

245
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,590
My heart...

246
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,890
My heart feels like it's being
ripped apart by a metal wire.

247
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,960
How is she?

248
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,370
The BP is too low.

249
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,970
At this rate, even with blood transfusion,
she can become brain dead.

250
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,580
Within the next few days.

251
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,370
No.

252
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,410
That won't happen.

253
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,060
Be quiet, Dr. Park.

254
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,020
<i>The happy memories
I had in my life.</i>

255
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,230
<i>Even if something happens to me,
In Young won't be as sad if she sees this.</i>

256
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,120
In Hye.

257
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,720
I still have a lot of things
I want to say to you.

258
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,630
You need to listen to me rant
when I am upset.

259
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,430
If you are not around,
who will I tell my story to?

260
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,910
Don't go, In Hye.

261
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,300
Don't go.

262
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,500
In Hye.

263
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,050
In Hye?

264
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,820
Dr. Cha.

265
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,320
In Hye.

266
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,300
Her BP has returned to normal.

267
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,200
Her pulse is normal, too.

268
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,500
How can the bleeding stop so
suddenly like this?

269
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,840
I don't know.

270
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,010
No one knows the reason.

271
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,370
In Hye, I missed you while
you were gone.

272
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,080
Good job, In Hye.

273
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,090
You've made it.

274
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,930
You've been a big help, Chae Kyung.

275
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,550
I didn't do anything.

276
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,260
How's the repayment process going?

277
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,820
About 70%.
We are out of the danger zone.

278
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,920
This is so ironic. That we need
to be grateful to the vice president.

279
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,810
It doesn't make any sense
to me, either.

280
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,770
Chairwoman Lee.

281
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,940
We can take a sigh of relief...

282
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,660
Let's have dinner together with
Director Choi and Do Han.

283
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,290
It's been awhile since
we've all been together.

284
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,670
Okay, Chae Kyung.

285
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,930
Let's do that.

286
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,750
Why don't you tell me now?

287
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,660
Why you helped us.

288
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,720
The pediatrics surgery department
had the best treatment method.

289
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:59,410
A superb treatment that no
pharmaceutical company can ever make.

290
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:08,640
But, I learned that this treatment is
not something you can buy with money.

291
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,190
The most valuable things in life are the ones
that can't be bought with money.

292
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,350
This treatment is the same way.

293
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,400
Thank you.

294
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,960
For understanding that value.

295
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,990
And...

296
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,770
There's something like that...
Speeding down full force.

297
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,850
I heard that you helped us out.

298
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,550
I didn't do anything big.

299
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,520
What are you going to do
from now on?

300
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,420
I'm sure you can't go back to
West Emerson.

301
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,690
Just...

302
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:12,340
live my life as a father.

303
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,040
I'm thinking about going to
a baseball game.

304
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,500
My favorite team made it to the post-season
games for the first time in 11 years.

305
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,230
I wanted to tell you something.

306
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,450
I respect you with all my heart,
Professor Kim.

307
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,360
Thank you.

308
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,470
Good bye.

309
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,310
Why are you here?

310
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,860
Where are you going?

311
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,940
Home.

312
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,360
To Tae Back.

313
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,400
You can't.

314
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,150
You can't go now.

315
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,560
Don't worry.

316
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,010
I won't hit your mom anymore.

317
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,110
It's hard for me to
even stand around now.

318
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,170
I'm lucky if I don't get beaten...
Who will I beat?

319
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,990
Shi On, let him do as he wishes.

320
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,070
We have all the medicine, too.

321
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,760
I won't hit your mom, so you
better take care of my memorial service.

322
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,390
Dad.

323
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,560
Look at all this crap I have to put up with just
to get someone to give me a memorial service...

324
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,400
You can't go like this.

325
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm fine.

326
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,210
I don't want to be a burden
to you anymore.

327
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,300
Mr. Park.

328
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,140
I want to die in peace...
in my own home.

329
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,400
That's my last wish.

330
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:46,310
Thank you for making a fine man
out of my lacking child.

331
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,490
Go back to work.

332
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,850
I'm leaving with your mom.

333
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,840
I'll get in touch.

334
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,340
There's no need.

335
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,690
Good bye, Director Choi.

336
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,310
<i>Dad.</i>

337
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:25,890
<i>I wish I had at least one
good memory of you.</i>

338
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,710
<i>Before you leave to a farther place,
please make my wish come true.</i>

339
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,730
<i>Please.</i>

340
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,030
The trash can outside is full.
Can I use this one here?

341
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,630
Sure.

342
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,940
I can't go alone anyway...
I'll just throw out the hotel tickets...

343
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,840
I'll just throw them out.

344
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,230
But why aren't they coming out?

345
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,980
Why are you throwing those out?
You should give them to someone.

346
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,580
I bought them to give to you,
why should I give them to someone else?

347
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,630
Just leave them here for now.

348
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,080
Really?

349
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,590
Here.

350
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,750
- You really don't want to go with me?
- Again?

351
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,910
You are the first woman
to slap my cheek like this.

353
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,850
Then, let's go together with the team.
You said there are two rooms.

354
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,740
Okay, we'll go.

355
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,440
We can just go out alone.

356
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,830
What?
Go where?

357
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,340
Ouch.

358
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,530
I can't bear to watch them.
They are holding hands and everything...

359
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:02,170
If she goes around holding his hand,
wouldn't she look like his therapist?

360
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,760
Hey!

361
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,550
Follow me.

362
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,820
Follow me!

363
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,930
You were the ones going around
talking trash about me and Dr. Park?

364
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,220
We weren't talking trash...

365
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,170
We just heard you two are
being very friendly...

366
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,590
Shut up!

367
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,620
You think I'm stupid?

368
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,960
What makes you so much better than
Park Shi On?

369
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,810
Did you ever perform a surgery?

370
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,640
Can you diagnose a patient in
an emergency case?

371
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,750
What makes you so great that
you can talk trash about someone else?

372
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,510
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

373
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,800
Get the heck out!

374
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,250
Before I force you out,
get out!

375
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,360
What's this?

376
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,410
You were listening?

377
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,930
Then you should have
spoken up!

378
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,440
What are you scared of?

379
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,300
Never mind...
Forget it.

380
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,240
Dr. Han.

381
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,690
Yes?

382
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,010
Do you remember what
you said to me before?

383
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,440
That painful love is still love?

384
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,130
Yes.
Why?

385
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,840
Now, I think I understand
what you meant.

386
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,880
I thought love would be a complete
pain-killer, but it hurts.

387
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,710
Speaking from my experience...

388
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,080
Regular love and painful love are two
different types of medicine.

389
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,270
Regular love is indeed a pain-killer.

390
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,720
But, painful love...

391
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,730
That's like rubbing alcohol.

392
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:42,280
It hurts so much in the beginning,
but later, the scar heals completely.

393
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,610
In the end, even painful love
will heal you.

394
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,250
So even if it hurts,
clench your teeth and hang in there.

395
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,370
Rubbing alcohol...
Clench my teeth, and hang in there.

396
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,870
Are you okay?

397
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,030
I think we need to go down.

398
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,920
There's no injury to the bone.

399
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,140
It's just bruising.

400
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,170
Yoon Seo!

401
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
What about the guy you
came with before?

402
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,480
He's working.
Residents don't have weekends.

403
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,350
You didn't break up, did you?

404
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,780
We shouldn't do that.
There's only one bridge between us.

405
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,600
Actually...

406
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,850
- Everything I say is a lie.
- What?

407
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,570
I don't have those abilities.
I just use my gut feeling.

408
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,910
Gut feeling?

409
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:13,640
But you said I have a spirit of liquor
and spirit of fire...

410
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,250
When you first came, you wreaked of liquor.
And your temper...

411
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,040
Fine, but...

412
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,660
The thing about animals with
my boyfriend...

413
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,190
A man that friendly looking
must like animals...

414
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,600
You should have told me then...

415
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,320
I was so down because of
that bridge talk...

416
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,560
I say that to all the couples,
so they don't get too comfortable.

417
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,710
Still...

418
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,390
I really...

419
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,500
I'm sorry.

420
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,650
This is a gut feeling I have
as a woman...

421
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,390
That guy seems like a
really good catch.

422
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,980
You're right on.

423
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,710
Hold on.

424
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,920
<i>I will clench my teeth,
and hang in there.</i>

425
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,090
Do Han.

426
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,210
What's wrong?

427
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,030
You have something to tell me?

428
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,570
No.

429
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,950
I don't have anything to say...

430
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,670
But there's something I need to do.

431
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,340
What's that?

432
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,500
Do Han.

433
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:12,820
Your proposal is just like your
first confession to me...

434
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,440
I just need to get to the point.

435
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,220
Let's do it.

436
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,180
Let's get married.

437
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,230
Seriously...

438
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,080
You're too straight forward.

439
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,850
Let's live well together.

440
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,820
What else do I need to do?

441
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,950
Let's do that.

442
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,070
What else do we need?

443
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,830
Cheers!

444
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,620
- How long has it been?
- It's already been a year.

445
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,550
Right!
You were so drunk that time...

446
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,600
Don't get drunk again.

447
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,460
They are here!

448
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,910
He's cute.

449
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,490
Hey, it's been such a long time.

450
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,050
You were alive?

451
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,550
Say hello.

452
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,750
They are my high school friends.

453
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,930
Hello, my name is Park Shi On.

454
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,710
We heard a lot about you.

455
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,890
Have a seat.

456
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,700
Yoon Seo, let's talk.

457
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,520
I need to tell you something
about work.

458
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,720
You can stay here.

459
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,460
- Be good to him.
- Fine.

460
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,930
What is it?

461
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,560
I told you that I would bring him.

462
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,960
It's not because I don't like Dr. Park.
I'm just looking out for you.

463
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,030
There aren't a lot here, but what
if the word spreads to all our friends?

464
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,150
Whatever!

465
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,750
Why would I have brought him
if I wanted to keep it a secret?

466
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,980
What's wrong with you?

467
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,170
You should make up an excuse,
and just leave.

468
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,940
If it gets uncomfortable...

469
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,820
Not there...

470
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,460
Look over there!

471
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,520
That's what happened.

472
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,960
So, this is what I said...

473
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,180
'This is my house.'

474
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,900
And Dr. Cha said,
'Why is this your house? This is...'

475
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,270
Dr. Park is so cute.

476
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,410
Are there any other cute guys around?

477
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,350
No way...

478
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,300
Even if you try hard all your life,
you can't find a good catch like this.

479
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:02,080
But Dr. Park,
what do you like about Yoon Seo?

480
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,440
She's like a Christmas gift.

481
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:11,330
When she's not around, I want to see her.
When I do see her, I get so happy.

482
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,790
Whether she's with me or not,
she makes me so happy.

483
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,960
How corny...

484
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,770
Why is that corny?

485
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,770
That's a beautiful analogy.

486
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,230
But...

487
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,050
When was your first kiss?

488
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,710
How embarrassing...

489
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,620
But, when was our first kiss?

490
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,410
How can you do that so suddenly?

491
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,380
You told me that a kiss is something
you can do anytime and anywhere.

492
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,740
Still...

493
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,150
You should have at least
given me a sign or something.

494
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,730
Sign?

495
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,560
From now on, I'll give you a sign.

496
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,640
I'll wink at you.

497
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,250
Don't.

498
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,370
That's even weirder.

499
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,640
But...

500
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,940
How did it feel?

501
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,630
It was a short while, but it felt
stimulating like someone put ice on my neck.

502
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,370
And?

503
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,370
And...

504
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,580
My head felt dizzy as if I had just
gotten up from a headstand.

505
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,760
What else?

506
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,950
And...

507
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,090
What is it?

508
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:05,350
It's nothing.

509
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,840
Tell me.

510
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,170
The feeling on my lips...

511
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,550
The feeling...

512
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,680
Hey!

513
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,410
You need to explain in detail.
What about the feeling?

514
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,900
Come on.

515
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,850
- I can't explain.
- How did it feel?

516
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,310
- I feel embarrassed.
- Who cares?

517
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,570
<i>You need to surpass me.</i>

518
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,780
<i>I know you can't even assist in surgery
because you are still a resident.</i>

519
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,840
<i>But in every other way,
you must surpass me.</i>

520
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,170
<i>So that others won't notice
your handicap.</i>

521
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
<i>Thank you for not hating me.</i>

522
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,650
<i>Since you don't hate me,
I'm not as scared of you.</i>

523
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,350
<i>Before, I was so scared of you.</i>

524
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,750
<i>I'm still scared of you.</i>

525
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,090
<i>But, it's a bit less.</i>

526
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,510
I'm sorry for making you come
all the way here.

527
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,370
No, it's okay.

528
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,410
But, what is it?

529
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,100
- It's about Dr. Park Shi On.
- Dr. Park Shi On?

530
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,350
It's been over three months
since he's been here.

531
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:02,180
The purpose was for him to get his
qualifications as a doctor verified here.

532
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,910
And because they had decided to invalidate
his national medical exam scores.

533
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,050
We have enough information now
to make a sound decision.

534
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:15,540
You had mentioned six months to us,
but I think we have already seen enough.

535
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,640
Okay.

536
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,220
Tell me.

537
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,200
There's no problem at all.

538
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,450
He's a good colleague and junior
to all of us.

539
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,280
I feel the same way!

540
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,320
He's an inseparable part of our team.

541
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,930
He's a great senior to me.
He teaches me so many things.

542
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,490
Woo Il Kyu.

543
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,180
Yes.

544
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,820
I...

545
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,070
I only feel bad...

546
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,290
I didn't take very good care of him.

547
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,410
So I want to keep him around,
and take good care of him.

548
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,650
If that punk is not...

549
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,210
If Dr. Park is not around,
it would be boring around here.

550
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,070
I'm sure you know
even if I don't say anything.

551
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,370
This is a log for Dr. Park's activities,
and his evaluation papers.

552
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,540
It's up to you to make the
final decision now.

553
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,350
<i>As verified by the Sung Won University Hospital,
his qualifications have been validated.</i>

554
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,740
<i>We hereby nullify the decision to
disqualify Dr. Park Shi On</i>

555
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,500
<i>as a nationally certified
medical practitioner.</i>

556
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,030
Turn around.

557
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,860
Okay.

558
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,970
Thank you.

559
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,250
Stop moving.

560
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,130
Okay.

561
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:21,940
Remember when I told you to
surpass me?

562
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,750
Yes.

563
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,710
You've already surpassed me.

564
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,230
You've overcome everything.

565
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,530
Hello.

566
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:54,200
I am Lee Chul Ho, the director of the
NHPLEB.

567
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:01,610
I've never personally handed out
a certification before.

568
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:09,870
But, this was such a meaningful day
that I had to come in person.

569
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,410
Dr. Park Shi On has overcome his handicap,
and proven his qualifications as a great doctor.

570
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,750
In doing so, he has destroyed
the existing prejudice

571
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,100
and given hope to all people
with disabilities.

572
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,890
Being inspired, we have put in plans
for testing the disabled.

573
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,780
And we will continue to work hard
to make improvements.

574
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:38,000
Dr. Park Shi On, step forward.

575
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,840
Certificate of Qualification.

576
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,430
Park Shi On from Sung Won University
Hospital, Pediatrics Department.

577
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:01,520
It is recognized that the above person has passed
the national medical practitioner examination

578
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:04,070
administered by the NHPLEB.

579
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,690
We award this certificate this
13th day of October, year 2013.

580
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,060
From the Director of the NHPLEB.

581
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:31,630
I am still a little different from
other people.

582
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:36,190
The way I talk and the way I act
are a bit different from others.

583
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,990
That's why I worked really really hard
to minimize that gap.

584
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,130
But, it wasn't easy.

585
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,670
The more I tried,
the more it hurt.

586
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:57,400
That's why I thought that I would
lead a different life until my death.

587
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,680
But a lot of good people
have filled up that gap for me.

588
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:13,050
That's why I am able to
stand here today.

589
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,510
Thank you for filling up that gap.

590
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,000
Thank you for not avoiding me.

591
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,720
And...

592
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,620
Thank you so much for loving me.

593
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,700
I knew from the beginning that
you would do well.

594
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,160
If you weren't around,
I wouldn't have made it.

595
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:22,120
If you weren't around,
I would have missed out on a lot, too.

596
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,690
Thank you so much, Dr. Cha.

597
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,030
Me, too.
Thank you so much, Dr. Park Shi On.

598
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,220
What's this?

599
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,220
Isn't it a toy scalpel?

600
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,550
Yes, my brother bought me this when I
told him that I wanted to become a doctor.

601
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,390
It's a precious gift.

602
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,590
Yes.

603
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:16,230
It's a precious scalpel
that enabled me to become a doctor.

604
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:23,670
For you, what is that green scalpel?

605
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,690
For me?

606
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,120
My little brother.

607
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,020
I heard from Dr. Cha.

608
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,090
That you had a handicapped brother.

609
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
She told me not to say anything.

610
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,580
It's okay now.

611
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,940
Just as this scalpel is precious to you,
my brother is precious to me.

612
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,890
You are really really a great brother.

613
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,400
Park Shi On.

614
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,270
Is this how you play with
Dr. Cha?

615
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,520
We both do like to do this.

616
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,820
Shi On.

617
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,700
I think this is the first time
that you are calling me by my name.

618
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:34,760
Do you want to
be my younger brother?

619
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,270
- How could I be like that with you...
- Then forget it.

620
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,000
No, big brother.

621
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,770
Only call me that when
we are alone.

622
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,420
If you call me that when others are
around, you'll be sorry.

623
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,070
Okay, big brother.

624
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,290
Yes, Mom.

625
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,130
Shi On...

626
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,320
Dad... left.

627
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,140
<i>[One year later]</i>

628
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,030
<i>[Donated by Dr. Park Shi On]</i>

629
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,310
I'm going!

630
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,150
Okay, have a good day.

631
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,160
I'll be back.

632
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,590
Hey, Park Woong Ki,
you are going to keep this up?

633
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,140
I seriously have nothing to say.

634
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,490
Medication check, ER call, procedure...
There is nothing you do right!

635
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,720
I'm sorry.

636
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,550
You think that will cut it?

637
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,400
Don't you know that you are
responsible for a patient's life?

638
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,020
It's just that I had so much work...

639
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,600
How dare you make excuses?

640
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,280
You really want to get punished?

641
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,620
I'm sorry.

642
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,170
Dr. Park, be gentle.

643
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,570
No.

644
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,960
You...

645
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,440
If you are going to keep this up,
just get out!

646
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,680
Go home!

647
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,860
You...

648
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:05,720
If I catch you being mindless again,
you're automatically out!

649
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,510
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

650
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,550
Go to the ward!

651
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,050
Yes, sir.

652
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,930
Hey.

653
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,040
Why are you being so harsh
on that nice kid?

654
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,670
He needs to stay focused.

655
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,800
Otherwise, something bad will happen.

656
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,920
He's become such a mean guy.

657
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,950
It's hot in here.

658
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,320
Just stay there.

659
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,380
Yes, sir.

660
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,800
Eat this.

661
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,640
Give me the bigger one.

662
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,650
Okay...

663
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,320
What?

664
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,560
Fine.
Take it.

665
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,740
Thank you.

666
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,080
What kind of a kid is this?

667
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,720
Another strange one...

668
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,240
- You are sick of the hospital, right?
-  Yes.

669
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,690
But, I'll miss all of you.

670
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,490
You went through so much
this past year.

671
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,930
No, I'm so grateful to all of you.

672
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,700
Thank you so much for everything.

673
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,620
You...

674
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,970
You can't go around too much
for awhile.

675
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,240
I know.

676
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,880
You are so rigid these days.

677
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,510
Let's get together soon.

678
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,230
- Let's go eat pork feet.
- Okay.

679
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:07,370
Why am I tearing up?

680
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,860
Thank you, Nurse Nam.

681
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,780
Dr. Han is the happiest one here...
Don't you agree, Ms. In Young?

682
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,350
Dr. Cha.
Dr. Park.

683
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:26,120
Don't fight,
and get along well.

684
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,450
It was so hard getting you two together.

685
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,230
Okay.

686
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,810
If I have a problem,
I'll call you.

687
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,530
No, take care of your own
problems now.

688
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,030
Should we go?

689
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,690
Professor Kim.

690
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,890
What is it?

691
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:59,590
Dr. Cha told me once.

692
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,380
That good people become
good doctors.

693
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,950
And?

694
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:08,050
What is your definition of a good doctor?

695
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,870
A good doctor?

696
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:17,000
All doctors who contemplate about
the meaning of a good doctor.

697
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,920
<i>Thinking about it,
I think that's true.</i>

698
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:42,920
<i>All doctors who contemplate the
meaning of a good doctor are good doctors.</i>

699
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,640
<i>All of them are also good people.</i>

700
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:51,840
<i>But in order to become a
good person...</i>

701
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,470
<i>I came to realize that one needs
to have a lot of pain.</i>

702
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:03,320
<i>To understand others' pains, one must
come to an understanding of one's own pain.</i>

703
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:08,410
<i>So, I'm going to feel pain everyday.</i>

704
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:11,220
<i>Even so, I think I'll be okay.</i>

705
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,730
<i>I'll be amongst other people.</i>

706
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:20,440
<i>And I will be getting loved
by someone.</i>

707
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:47,520
