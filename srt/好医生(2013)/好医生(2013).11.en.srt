-1:59:56,500 --> -1:59:54,230
<i>Good Doctor</i>

2
-1:59:57,730 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Episode 11</i>

3
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,170
I will not go!

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,670
I will give birth here and do the child's surgery.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,160
Really?

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,710
Then why don't you do the surgery after you divorce?

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,590
If you give birth to the baby here, 
I won't take care of either you or the baby.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,170
Let's do that then!

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,190
In this household, I cannot raise my child.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,070
The mother! The mother is in danger!

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,810
Soo Jin!

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,110
Move her to the treatment room now! 
Take her EKG quickly and bring a tocolytic.

13
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,610
Hurry up!

14
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,520
Ji Shin, you can't use epinephrine.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,640
We know.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,060
What about the baby? The baby?

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,000
Do not worry, the baby will be okay.

18
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,700
What happened?

19
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,340
She has come back to normal.

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,720
Then, please take a look at her ECHO.

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,380
First we must see the baby's condition.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,200
It seems... that I could no longer hide from you.

23
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,500
I am sorry, Director.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,730
For 20 years, what on earth have you been doing that you have appeared right now?!

25
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,890
Right after you left, why didn't you call?

26
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,600
Right after I left, there was a situation...

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,900
What situation? 
Tell me what situation it was!

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,100
I will tell you later.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,490
Does Si On not know?

30
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,270
Yes,

31
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,580
even though he saw my face, he doesn't recognize me.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,140
Until he recognizes,

33
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,050
I will act as if I don't know him.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,370
Director, please act as if you don't know too.

35
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,410
What if he still can't recognize you?

36
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,980
Then are you still going to do so?

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,040
I have to...

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,470
the one who's a sinner...

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,750
how can I step out and claim that I'm his mother at this point?

40
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,150
What should we do about the mother-in-law?

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,040
She's not even a gangster or something...

42
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,420
Anyways, position security guards near Lee Soo Jin's hospital room.

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,210
If something happens, tell them to contact us right away.

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,540
Yes.

45
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,570
Ah, by the way, professor. How's the fetus?

46
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,560
According to her ECHO, there weren't any serious problems.

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,130
It could have been a serious situation with one little slip.

48
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,250
I didn't expect she'd succumb to a sudden 
stress induced cardiomyopathy.

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,430
There wasn't any patient history of this, right?

50
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,970
Yes, there was nothing wrong with her heart.

51
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,200
But, shouldn't we perform the surgery after she has regained stability?

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,170
At least a few days.

53
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,660
The bigger problem is that there are limitations that comes with this surgery.

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,260
- Is it because of the heart and womb contractions? 
 - Yes.

55
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,550
We can't use regular dosage.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,520
Because there might be a big impact on the heart.

57
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,880
Then the time allotted to secure the fetus' respiratory tract
isn't 30minutes, but..

58
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,040
15 minutes.

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,360
Within 15 minutes.

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,980
What about the baby?

61
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,330
Is it okay?

62
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,490
It is okay.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,710
And please don't worry.

64
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,320
Because there are Batman-like men outside,

65
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,410
so the Joker-like men won't be able to take you away.

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,240
Thank you, Doctor.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,230
No, I am more thankful.

68
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,750
Because you are going to give birth to and raise a healthy child.

69
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,090
This is something a husband should say.

70
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,750
But, I'm hearing this from you.

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,750
Oh.. Sorry if that sounded rude.

72
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,380
No.

73
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,800
Although it's from a doctor, it cheered me up.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,940
Expectant mother,

75
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,370
Fighting!

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,470
Fighting.

77
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,520
Going from the ER to the Cardiology Dept to the OB/GYN,

78
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,730
Everything is so hectic.

79
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,110
I really hate her mother-in-law. I truly hate her.

80
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,700
She seems so like the evil witch from Snow White.

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,900
Are you saying a few curse words toward that Madame?

82
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,180
I think I know why people curse now.

83
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,240
You said that you hated cursing and hearing it too.

84
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,930
No, I do know how to curse as well.

85
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,910
Really?

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,680
Try it. Try it, try it, try it!

87
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,160
-Why you little...
-Little...Get your toe pinched on the door,

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,340
chew on a piece of foil eating Kim Bob, 
and pop a pimple while scratching your head!

89
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,630
Is that a curse?

90
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,950
After hearing it, it's funny. But, it's not a curse.

91
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,720
You really don't feel bad?

92
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,650
I don't feel bad at all!

93
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,810
Doctor.

94
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,430
Yes, Mother.

95
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,750
Really?

96
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,100
Truthfully, we were really hesitant too.

97
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,150
The fact that we have to raise another child is not a simple task.

98
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,420
But, Gyu Hyun really wants it.

99
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,460
And as much as we have refound our family's happiness, we want to do something good in return.

100
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,700
Thank you so much!

101
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,850
In any case, we were about to put her up for adoption.

102
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,010
I don't know if we can raise her well.

103
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,880
You are able to raise her well.

104
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,770
Gyu Hyun's mother, you are the best!

105
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,980
Now, the "Secret Cave"... Finished!

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,790
Me too! Me too!

107
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,700
Doctor, don't come inside.

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,680
It's too small.

109
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,920
I understand.

110
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,860
I talked with too much emotion last time.

112
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,370
No.

113
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,880
I too was filled with emotions.

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,160
Chae Gyeong,

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,330
The plan that you have established, I hope that you can reconsider it.

117
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,550
I understand why you thought of all that.

118
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,000
But, that road is something we must not take.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,040
I will reconsider it.

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,870
Even though I went a little too far to turn back.

121
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,380
Okay.

122
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,810
For the time being, let's take some time apart.

123
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,470
We are both so tired and busy.

124
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,690
I think we are becoming sensitive.

125
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,590
Do as you want.

126
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,110
I will always be in the same place.

127
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,250
Then, I guess we won't be able to be together today...

128
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,550
Happy Birthday!

129
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,690
Thank you.

130
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,490
We wish you happy birthday!

131
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,530
Happy Birthday, Professor.

132
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,770
Now, start!

133
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,160
♪ Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! ♪

134
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,240
That's enough!!

135
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't sing.

136
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,130
It's embarrassing.

137
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,800
Well, it is for us too..

138
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,610
Hurry up and blow it out.

139
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,490
Blow it out!

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,290
Don't spend your time on silly things like this. Just study!

141
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,550
Studying is also important, but we must become humans first.

142
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,360
It's not much, but this is our present.

143
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,340
I am thankful. But starting from next year, don't do anything like this.

144
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,280
Alright?

145
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,830
He said to do it again next year.

146
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,440
Eat quickly and get back to work.

147
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
YES!

148
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,590
Let's eat!

149
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,070
I didn't know it was the Professor's birthday.

150
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,640
I should have contributed money for his present.

151
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,380
Aigoo, forget it.

152
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,690
The youngest doesn't have to do stuff like that.

153
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,500
Let's eat.

154
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,160
Ah, let me eat this.

155
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,540
Ah, please cut a bigger slice for me.

156
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,900
Hey, where are you going not eating this cake?

157
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,710
Did you do the blood test?

158
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,380
I just had it done.

159
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,340
There won't be much of a problem, when you look 
at the routinely done tests' results.

160
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,530
I think I will have the surgery and treatment costs ready by next month.

161
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,840
Then,

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,530
It is possible to have the transplant surgery right away, correct?

163
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,560
Yes.

164
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,790
But then, Miss Na In Young

165
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,440
don't you have any intentions to think it over again?

166
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,040
Yes.

167
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,280
I'm saying this many times,

168
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,650
If ever something goes wrong during the surgery,

169
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,850
Like In Hae, you might need to receive nutrients from an IV bag your whole life.

170
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,440
Second, you may have to live with the risk of getting hepatitis.

171
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,550
I... it doesn't matter.

172
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,420
As long as it is possible to get a safe transplant surgery.

173
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,630
I'm asking you a favor.

174
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,280
Please continue to keep it a secret from

175
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,970
my sister and the pediatric surgery department.

176
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,680
What is it?

177
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,030
It's a gift.

178
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,460
I already received one a while ago.

179
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,820
I didn't pitch in.

180
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,120
That's why I'm giving you a separate one.

181
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,080
For not hating me,

182
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,020
Thank you.

183
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,570
Because you don't hate me anymore, I don't find you as scary.

184
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,230
Before, I found you very scary.

185
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,690
Though I'm still scared.

186
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,200
A little... I'm a little less scared.

187
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,610
Happy Birthday.

188
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,370
<i>It's my gift.</i>

189
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,860
<i>You said you're really going to become a doctor.</i>

190
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>Thank you, little brother.</i>

191
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,090
<i>If you really become a doctor, you must fix me first.</i>

192
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,020
Tell me honestly.

193
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,960
Who is the most handsome among the three of us?

194
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,540
It's Dr. Park, of course!

195
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,570
What a looker!

196
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,610
Hey! Before Dr. Park came, I ranked first.

197
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,410
Then I'm second.

198
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,480
Aigoo! You should say something that makes sense.

199
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,380
How can you come in second, Nurse Jo?!

200
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,620
If I'm not then, no. Why do you get so angry?

201
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,790
Then frankly speaking, do people as handsome as Dr. Park and Dr. Han earn more?

202
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,870
That's right. They earn more.

203
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,580
According to the result of analysis co-conducted by 
Australian National University &amp; Melbourne University,

204
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,080
the study analyzed the results of the association between attractive looks and economics.

205
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,350
an attractive male will, on the average,

206
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,790
make $36,000 more per annum
than its not so handsome counterpart male.

207
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,820
Then our Senior Nurse will be short of $3,600 won every year.

208
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,360
What a waste of money. What a waste of money, aigoo.

209
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,430
Recently, you see...

210
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,630
Dr. Park is really not on my side.

211
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,290
Not really.

212
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,810
In Hye, you're disturbing the doctors again.

213
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,460
Unni.

214
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,470
Oh, this awkward feeling..

215
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,130
Perhaps,

216
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,840
did you get a blood test?

217
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,290
Ahhh...

218
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,310
No, I got hurt a bit.

219
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,870
It's the same band aid that they have in the blood test room.

220
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
It's really a blood test.

221
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,700
I just did a blood test because I've been a bit tired lately.

222
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,140
That's why I told you not to overdo it.

223
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,160
Let's go in.

224
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,710
Miss In Young.

225
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,770
Yes?

226
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,250
It's not that bad, right?

227
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,720
It's nothing. Just...

228
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,410
Excuse me, Miss In Young,

229
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,490
Yes?

230
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,990
I apologize for making you uncomfortable last time.

231
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,710
But it was not a joke.

232
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,660
It definitely wasn't just a illusion or a curiosity between a doctor and the patient.

233
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,080
That time,

234
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,730
that was the only way to express myself.

235
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,950
I didn't know how to express it so it won't burden you

236
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,200
and not to upset you.

237
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,270
It's still the same now.

238
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,790
That's why it's so frustrating.

239
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,410
I also know you're not such a shallow person.

240
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,900
I've seen you for many years.

241
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,900
I...

242
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,400
for me to accept Doctor's (your) invitation,

243
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,030
I'm not in that situation.

244
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,510
I was more sorry.

245
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,440
Why are you crying?

246
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,570
It's because of me.

247
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,740
To get my intestine transplant surgery done,

248
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,990
She's working all day long.

249
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,530
She doesn't even get a day off.

250
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,100
If Mom and Dad were still here

251
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,830
She wouldn't have to go through that hardship.

252
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,780
It takes up so much money,...

253
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,300
She should just leave it alone.

254
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,460
They're bad!

255
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,590
The people who caused the accident.

256
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,420
Accident?

257
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,020
Because I was in a hit and run accident,

258
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,040
my entire small intestine is gone.

259
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,610
If that person were caught,

260
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,090
we could have received compensation money.

261
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,760
I didn't know.

262
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,860
I'm so sorry.

263
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,550
I must not have looked at your records properly.

264
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,950
I thought it was because of another illness.

265
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,860
I'm really sorry.

266
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,420
No,

267
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,740
I also didn't want to talk about it.

268
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,210
If I talked about it, I would get angry.

269
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,830
I just want to live.

270
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,040
I want to make it so that my sister would be comfortable.

271
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,820
It's not like that, In Hye.

272
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,950
If I were sick just like you, my brother would have done the same.

273
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,190
Even so,

274
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,420
my sister is so pitiful.

275
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,260
You know there's been it's share of rumours regarding
the take over of our hospital.

276
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,030
But still, it's different this time.

277
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,570
Taking over our hospital, the whole hospital...

278
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,090
They want to transform it into a hospital for children.

279
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,010
That is not practical.

280
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,620
Based on our national institutional insurance policies
that won't fetch any profitability.

281
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,270
That's not everything.

282
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,250
I heard they'll be redeveloping us as "for-profit" hospital.

283
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,120
"For-profit"?

284
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,090
That's not become legal as of yet.

285
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,160
For now, they will probably maintain 
the current hospital system and wait for the right time.

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,820
Until such time as the "for-profit" hospitals can become legalized.

287
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,750
The treatment cost for children has been easily surpasses that of adults.

288
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,190
Surgeries, drugs, equipment, special promotions...

289
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,760
Since everything has to be suitable for children, the cost will be high.

290
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,310
Then the profit sensitive insurance industry will start
to view children as a profit and loss.

291
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,600
Even though that does include high expenses,

292
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,740
Parents will accept that and come to the hospital.

293
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,410
That's right.

294
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,330
I'm sure (this trend) has merit in increasing the quality 
of the medical service within the industry,

295
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,630
however will increase the patients' (financial) burden exponentially.

296
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,210
Go in.

297
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,970
Have a good time with General Manager, too.

298
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,120
Okay.

299
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,680
Cha Yeon Seo.

300
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,940
Yes?

301
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,910
Do you have time in the evening?

302
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,450
Did you fight with head of the department?

303
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,580
No.

304
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,220
Then why aren't you meeting her?

305
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
Something just happened.

306
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,310
I don't know what the reason is, but

307
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:00,380
how can you not meet her on this beautiful day?

308
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,440
When you're in a relationship these kind of things may happen.

309
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,630
Well, you haven't ever even dated properly. How would you know?

310
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,050
Why are you like that to me?!

311
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:15,300
It feels bad enough that I'm filling in as a replacement.

312
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,050
I'm going to

313
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,550
have to catch a guy soon.

314
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,310
What good does it do to catch a guy?

315
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,000
If they have a drink with you, they'll all run away.

316
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,290
I

317
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,100
do not tremble before I guy I like when giving a shot!

318
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,720
You did to me long ago, on welcoming day.

319
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,150
What?

320
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,820
Sunbaenim...

321
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,970
From a long time ago I've been lik...

322
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,570
Lik... Do you like steamed food?

323
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,580
What's that?

324
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,290
How do you remember that?

325
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,120
I cannot forget the stank odor of maekgoli. (korean rice wine)

326
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,290
I must've been crazy then!

327
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,760
I'm so embarrassed!

328
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,930
Thank you.

329
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,600
Hello.

330
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,170
Hello.

331
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,030
Are you okay?

332
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,090
I think I just put a whole potato that's just been steamed.

333
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,660
Have you thought about it?

334
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,410
What I told you last time.

335
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,150
To think about what's for Professor Kim Do Han.

336
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,630
Yes. I thought about it.

337
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,580
First it's not disobeying his words.

338
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,980
If Professor says to not do something, I mustn't.

339
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,240
And?

340
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,420
And?

341
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,870
It's to hang out with him when he's alone.

342
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,380
Is Professor alone a lot?

343
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,840
Yes. He plays basketball alone,

344
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,970
and eats alone too.

345
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,490
Also he barely smiles.

346
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,250
That's similar with me.

347
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,350
For someone to smile it takes 17 muscles.

348
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,400
But Professor, those muscles aren't in use.

349
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,740
It's going to go in, go in, go in.

350
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,270
Oh yeah!!!

351
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,040
In the operation room, your hands are as precious as gold, but how come your bowling skills are mediocre?

352
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,830
You're not even a kid, why do you like these things?

353
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,560
You're to one who brought our team here first in spring 2008.

354
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,920
Me?

355
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,700
That time we smelled a lot like alcohol

356
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,540
You told us to play in a healthy way and then left.

357
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,750
Oh yeah, was it the day after you told me you liked me?

358
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,500
Or was it the before?

359
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,640
You're talking about that again?!

360
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,910
How come you never said that you
 liked me again after that day?

361
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,540
After that you started dating the head of department.

362
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,750
I changed my feelings toward you.

363
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,880
If you were giving up, why don't you just admit it?

364
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,030
Usually I don't ever give up,

365
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,000
but I'm nothing compared to the head of the department.

366
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,890
Even if a women sees her, she's so cool.

367
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,160
You're cool too kiddo.

368
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,720
Me?

369
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,730
Whenever possible I get drunk, and

370
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,890
I'm always walking around is that dirty gown, that's cool?

371
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,030
If I say so, it is.

372
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,930
Where do you think you are that you keep questioning what I say, arrogantly.

373
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,740
Today

374
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,880
I'm holding back because it's your birthday!

375
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,210
<i>Si Deok. Si Deok. Si Deok.</i>

376
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:08,080
<i>I'm sorry, Si Deok. Si Deok. Si Deok.</i>

377
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,800
Look at me straightly,

378
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,510
and put your hand down.

379
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,580
And repeat after me.

380
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,730
H-e-l-l-o...

381
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,050
H-a-l-l-o...
No, that's not it.

382
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,140
Repeat after me again.

383
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:08,060
H-e-l-l-o...

384
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,220
Good job.

385
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,100
Yes?

386
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,840
What brings you here? Is something wrong?

387
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,420
Si On-

388
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,440
From a while ago

389
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,300
I keep having dreams.

390
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,110
In the abandoned mine,

391
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,760
when Hyungah was going to heaven, that dream.

392
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,140
I couldn't remember quite well at that time,

393
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,710
but I keep having dreams.

394
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,630
And I'm starting to remember little by little.

395
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,260
Now I remember everything

396
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,210
but why,

397
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,880
why did you save me?

398
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,510
Si On,

399
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,980
Why...

400
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,420
why didn't you save Hyungah

401
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,630
and save me?

402
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:42,420
Hyungah is stronger and smarter than me.

403
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,230
If you saved him, people would've been more happy.

404
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,230
Even if I can't remember, mom and dad would've liked it too.

405
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,180
It's not like that.

406
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,450
No,

407
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,680
you saved me because I had a special talent.

408
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,910
You saved me because you wanted
 me to become a doctor like you.

409
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,390
I'm telling you it's not like that.

410
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:05,200
I was supposed to... go to heaven back then.

411
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,350
Hyungah was supposed to live.

412
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,290
The reason why I saved you...

413
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,100
Do you really want to know?

414
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,000
Because there was a higher chance for you to live.

415
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,180
Your breathing and pulse.

416
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,550
You had a higher chance of living.

417
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,370
If Si Deok had a higher chance to live,

418
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,750
I would've saved Si Deok.

419
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,390
I... Because I'm a doctor.

420
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,200
Thanks for being a good replacement today.

421
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,880
What can I do? You're the boss at work.

422
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,550
I have to look good in front of the boss.

423
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,150
Then, go home carefully.

424
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,870
Yoon Seo.

425
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,240
Yes?

426
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,960
Thank you for always being by my side.

427
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,620
Park Si On.

428
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,050
Did you drink again?

429
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,260
Don't let it distress you too much.

430
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,960
The Director

431
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,940
has made the right decision.

432
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,920
I know.

433
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:32,050
I too know that he had no choice but to do that.

434
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,520
But

435
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,040
I feel so even more sorry for Hyung-ah.

436
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,830
He went into the mine because of me.

437
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,160
He couldn't wear the respirator either because of me.

438
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,050
I told you not to think like that!

439
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:58,660
You see, in this world, there are a lot of 
things we can't do anything about.

440
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,410
We are doctors, aren't we?

441
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,480
Going forward, you will experience 
things like that a countless times.

442
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,380
Look at me.

443
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,300
In the past, Min Hee was like that too.

444
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,050
Si On.

445
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:27,030
You just need to repay the world with 
as much hard work as it took for you to stay alive.

446
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:32,860
If you are good to the children and heal them, 
that right there is repayment.

447
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,060
Still

448
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,040
that doesn't change the fact that 
our Hyung-ah is pitiful.

449
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,270
Rather,

450
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,410
it might have been better 
if I had not been born into this world.

451
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:52,420
Then, the Director wouldn't have had to suffer hardship.

452
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,900
And Hyung-ah might not have had to go to heaven either.

453
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,120
It's all because of me.

454
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,540
Who is it exactly that says that 
you are like a little child?

455
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:21,030
The self-condemnation that you're doing... 
That is not something children can do.

456
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,090
The self-condemnation that you're doing 
because you love people so very much,

457
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,450
even adults don't do that so well.

458
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,790
I

459
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,710
I am the worst.

460
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,910
No, that's definitely not true.

461
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,460
You're such a good person.

462
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,660
No.

463
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:58,290
♫ <i>My heart hurts. I feel this way still.</i> ♫

464
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:06,090
♫ <i>My pain that makes no sound
 grows even bigger.</i> ♫

465
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:20,180
♫ <i>Without a word, crying like that, </i>♫

466
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Into a for-profit hospital?

467
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,170
That's right.

468
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,200
It's a plan that's been prepared looking ahead.

469
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,790
What's the source of the rumor?

470
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,060
It's not a rumor.

471
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,930
It's what Assistant Director proposed.

472
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:44,940
The Assistant Director, that person, seems like someone 
from the party trying to take over our hospital.

473
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,300
He requested that I stay in place as the Director 
after changing it into a for-profit hospital.

474
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,080
It was the plan to entrust you with the directorship
 of the Integrated Pediatric Surgery Center.

475
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:02,900
The party taking over needed a doctor who has the most moral influence and who represents the academic community.

476
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,490
I didn't even know that and I...

477
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,920
Why?

478
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,800
Did he make some proposal to you too?

479
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,490
He didn't reveal the overall plan itself.

480
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,770
I received the request to recommend names of 
pediatric surgeons nationally-recognized.

481
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,790
To build the human database, 
he must have requested you.

482
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,750
At first, because it seemed it might help help the development of pediatric surgery, I accepted.

483
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,860
Because something made me reluctant, so I stopped.

484
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,790
What did?

485
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:39,030
By having Park Si On continue to remain at the hospital, 
he was planning to use him for public relations reasons.

486
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,910
As a pediatric specialist diagnostic genius who has conquered handicap.

487
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,540
That's why he was pretending to care that much about Si On.

488
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,270
That no-good person.

489
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:55,670
If it's not a rumor but there's truth to it,
 don't you think something will happen soon?

490
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,230
For right now, I'm keeping watch.

491
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,380
Because I don't see any movements.

492
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,620
Does Chairwoman Lee know?

493
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,160
I told her yesterday.

494
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,210
Chae Gyeong should know this too.

495
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,260
Ah, right.

496
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,680
For accepting Si On formally, thank you.

497
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,230
He's now not my student but your student.

498
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,970
Teach him in your way.

499
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,800
Eun Ok...

500
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,360
They are really good mom and dad.

501
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,750
So you have to listen to them well.

502
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:03,710
Doctor...

503
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:13,550
I love you.

504
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,170
I love you too, Eun Ok.

505
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,240
I really thank you.

506
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,870
No...

507
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:40,220
Because of you I am leaving after learning so much.

508
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,290
Thank you Dr...

509
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,990
I will to visit.

510
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,870
Fine, please sing me a song when you're all better.

511
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,460
Yes.

512
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,140
Let's go.

513
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,210
This world is so superficial.

514
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,220
Some are happily getting adopted and...

515
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,430
Some are, with bad intentions, sending kids to be adopted.

516
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,130
You're right it should be such a great thing.

517
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,180
Then, goodbye.

518
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,160
Bye Bye.

519
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,610
Aigoo, you made a huge accomplishment Dr. Park Si On

520
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,840
Ah.. Yes...

521
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,850
I...

522
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,350
will be leaving.

523
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,060
(Cardiac) Arrest. Arrest.

524
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Just breathe.

525
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,750
You're alert again. What am I supposed to do with this altruistic bachelor?

526
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,840
Have you tried expressing yourself 
in a roundabout way?

527
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,180
You're pretty, you're gorgeous

528
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,720
Obviously, the other person has no reaction right?

529
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,850
Just confess!

530
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,340
Dress up nicely and have one rose in your hand.

531
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,030
Confessing is there to be said. If you keep on treasuring it, it'll become poop!

532
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,420
Poop!

533
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:06,090
I still can't do it. It's too scary.

534
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,250
By chance if she says she doesn't like me...

535
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,180
Whether she rejects it or not start by confessing.

536
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,950
You'll feel more relieved.

537
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,740
Doc, if you continue like that you could die.

538
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,060
People who died from lovesickness are all over the place.

539
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,700
Lovesickness is not an actually diagnosable disease.

540
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,780
- Because there is another cause... 
- Hurry up and tell me who it is.

541
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,250
If you tell me who she is then I can become a even more helpful coach.

542
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,430
If you're not gonna tell me who tell don't ask me next time, okay?

543
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:40,820
I'm too embarrassed to say it in words so I'll right it down.

544
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,780
That's right! You should have done this from the start.

545
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,360
Okay, you're doing great!

546
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,760
<i>I'm not telling you.</i>

547
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,540
Is that what that was about in the end?

548
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,780
I'm sorry I didn't tell you ahead of time.

549
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,190
According to the director, he's asked you to leave the hospital?

550
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,120
I should close the loose ends I've created before I depart.

551
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,130
I don't believe there would be all that much trouble
even if you just left us as is.

552
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,860
You're talking to me as if...

553
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,640
I've committed a big sin or something?

554
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,230
It's isn't precisely a "sin".

555
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,100
It's just that you made a wrong judgement.

556
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,870
I think explaining it all, nitty-gritty

557
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,180
would be futile.

558
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,310
There will NEVER be any changes

559
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,160
to the identity of Seongwon hospital.

560
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,910
That's a shame.

561
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,330
In my own way, I was trying to hand you and

562
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,230
and the director the winning hand.

563
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,010
It's not necessary.

564
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,260
I hope we don't run into each other once you leave the hospital.

565
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,110
Let me ask you one last thing.

566
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,870
Is the general manager Yoo Chae Gyeong also

567
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,530
involved in this plan, perhaps?

568
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,590
General manager Yoo?

569
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,050
Never mind.

570
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,580
Hello.

571
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,200
Park Si On.

572
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,910
Yes.

573
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,470
Follow me.

574
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,840
These are the supporting documents for every thesis reported

575
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,500
to the Academy of Pediatric Surgery from 1985.

576
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,060
Commit to memory in a shortest time possible.

577
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,760
Uh..what?

578
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,870
After remembering it all, come be tested per chapter, by me.

579
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,340
The method of the test will not be simply about memorization.

580
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,120
You must answer the applied questions I come up based on these facts.

581
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,950
The difficulty is the highest, of course.

582
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,700
If you fall short on the related questions, there will be a penalty.

583
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,410
A pe..pe..pe..penalty, you say?

584
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,030
It'll be entry barred to the operation room whether you're
observing or scrubbing in.

585
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,790
P..pr..professor. I'm confident in memorization but

586
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,360
if you make a Jjaambbong (noodle but refers to act of mixing)...

587
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,830
You're good at Jjambbong!

588
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,530
Give it up if you're not confident.

589
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,200
I c..can do it.

590
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,060
Take it.

591
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,600
Man, this is really inhuman.

592
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,050
How many terabytes are these, by the way?

593
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,460
I think this is difficult even

594
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,900
for the assistant professor, don't you think?

595
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,500
You can't limit it to the assistant professor's level.

596
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,890
I bet you'd have to be at the University Journal level
AT LEAST, to comprehend it all.

597
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,450
What are you going to do now?

598
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,210
What would he do?

599
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,670
This is piece of cake for the memorization kin Park Si On.

600
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,490
He's saying it's not a simple matter of memory.

601
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:42,530
Just leave him to his own devices.

602
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,460
You worry about such an unimportant thing.

603
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,670
I feel like throwing up just thinking about it.

604
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,760
I also feel like throwing up.

605
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
It feels like I'm running a 100m dash right after eating 
3 rows of Kim Bob (about 8pc of sushi roll per row).

606
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,440
Hey, come now. You know you can do well.

607
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,750
We will be watching you with hope, Sunbae.

608
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,340
Fighting!

609
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,890
By the way, I heard you gave a total quagmire

610
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,070
to Park Si On as a project?

611
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,210
I don't think even I've received one of those.

612
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,070
I wonder how he'd handle it.

613
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:21,770
If it were me, I'd have given it up from the get-go.

614
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,940
You...would've?

615
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,860
Because it is an unreasonable project.

616
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,700
For the capacity of average men.

617
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,720
Ah...

618
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,020
But you've done this because you trust Park Si On, right?

619
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,270
As suspected, you're a great man.

620
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,400
This is just a beginning.

621
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,900
There's not much at the end even if he passes this.

622
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,860
Yes, professor.

623
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,860
<i>Divorce (Appointment of Parentage) Notice.</i>

624
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,070
Wait just a minute, please.

625
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,560
Do you really have to do this?

626
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,490
I'm only following my client's wishes.

627
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,090
Ms. Su Jin. Please think about it one more time.

628
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:25,240
Please do. Discuss it one last time with your mother-in-law.

629
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,100
She's not someone who'd listen to me.

630
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,570
Then you should discuss it with your husband who's in America.

631
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,920
My discussion with him is over as well.

632
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,340
Please schedule my surgery.

633
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,510
Fortunately, the heart condition has become favorable.

634
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,660
Right...but it can be temporary.

635
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,950
We have to monitor carefully.

636
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,780
I'm concerned how much longer the mother can carry the child

637
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,060
as the mother's condition is not stable.

638
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,200
Judging from her heart condition, we can't be sure 
what other emergency situation can occur.

639
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,570
If that happens (emergency), we can't guarantee 
 to preserve the life of the mother and the child.

640
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,500
Waiting could turn out to be the worse choice as well.

641
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,770
I'll just take the most expedient route.

642
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,560
How about you Sunbae?

643
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,140
Okay. Let's not wait with uncertainty and

644
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,950
just dive in tomorrow.

645
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,980
I'll lead up to the point of the baby's birth,

646
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,250
and after that you take over the whole thing, professor Kim.

647
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,090
Yes, Sunbae.

648
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,700
Notify the anesthesiology, pediatric, E.N.T right now.

649
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,330
Okay.

650
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,090
Let's see...

651
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,440
Wow, how many just for the biliary obstruction case?

652
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,270
You got this nailed, right?

653
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,030
We will answer quickly, quickly!

654
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:48,760
I am...con...fident.

655
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:54,730
This means that the professor has accepted you as a disciple.

656
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,930
So take on this task with confidence, and not be intimidated. Ok?

657
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,150
I'm taking off first.

658
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,930
Do your homework for tomorrow's surgery.

659
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:35,040
♫<i> One step. Even one step seems difficult. </i>♫

660
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,800
♫<i> Because I know the weight of that step, to my friend. </i>♫

661
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,950
♫<i> To my love, trust me. </i>♫

662
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,760
<i>Just confess</i>

663
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,520
<i>Show up dressed neatly holding a single rose!</i>

664
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:04,150
♫<i> Since I can walk along together, to my friend. </i>♫

665
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:12,130
♫<i> To my love, trust me .</i>♫

666
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:17,430
♫<i> Even though you know today. </i>♫

667
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:24,710
♫<i> For tomorrow, know that it's not the end of that start </i>♫

668
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:31,010
♫<i> and waiting you dreamed of. </i>♫

669
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:34,170
I..I am

670
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,380
you...professor...

671
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,630
professor...

672
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,780
Oh, man...

673
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,340
Hyungah,

674
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,910
help me out on this, please.

675
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,200
Are you going somewhere?

676
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,100
Why are you dressed up in the middle of the night?

677
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,400
What is it?

678
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,270
Do you have something to say?

679
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,700
Come in.

680
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,700
Hey.

681
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,400
This is so pretty.

682
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,200
You're quite good at creating an atmosphere.

683
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Seeing that you brought me this, you have a favor to ask me of.

684
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,700
Right?

685
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:11,000
Whatever it is, tell me. I'll do you any favor.

686
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,800
Doctor...

687
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,200
This is so frustrating! Tell me immediately!

688
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,220
Have you eaten yet?

689
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,250
Yes, I did.

690
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,870
Wow, you seem to have changed your wallpaper.

691
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:39,320
What do you mean I changed it? There's nothing special about it.

692
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,030
Then you changed your blanket...

693
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,760
What's wrong with you? Tell me now!

694
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,810
It's nothing. I just dropped by.

695
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,470
It doesn't seem so.

696
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,100
It's really like that. You know I can't lie.

697
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,300
Then what is wrong with you?

698
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,650
Why are you dressed like this?

699
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,490
Sometimes on Monday evenings,

700
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,670
I dress up like this. It's my hobby.

701
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,200
Your hobby is so special.

702
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,360
Then I'll be leaving.

703
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,700
Hey. Park Si On.

704
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,400
Hey!

705
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,890
What was that?

717
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,260
Doctor Park.

718
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,600
Hello.

719
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,210
Stop.

720
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,100
Did you commit some crime against me?

721
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,370
You're avoiding me fast.

722
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:06,170
This guy, this guy.

723
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,840
There's definitely something going on.

724
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,700
You weren't the same since last night.

725
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,680
No.

726
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,890
R-really no.

727
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,000
If you get caught later, you'll get in trouble twice as much!

728
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,500
It's really not that.

729
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,130
Okay.

730
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,540
Today, let's

731
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:37,090
end Lee Soo Jin's surgery well

732
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,210
so both the mother and the child

733
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,920
can be healthy.

734
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,870
Got it?

735
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:43,960
Yes.

736
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,110
Don't worry too much.

737
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,020
It's going to end well.

738
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,280
Why are you crying?

739
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,060
You're going to see a pretty baby soon.

740
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,100
One thing,

741
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,230
just promise me one thing.

742
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,570
If it happens

743
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:12,270
that between the baby and me

744
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:15,860
you have to choose only one,

745
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,900
please save the baby.

746
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,070
Please.

747
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,920
Please save the baby.

748
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,530
Aigoo. Why are you saying something like that?

749
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:33,120
Rest your mind.

750
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,300
Although you probably all know,

751
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,180
the surgery has became really hard.

752
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,300
Because of variables unknown to us,

753
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,530
it could become even harder.

754
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,200
We only have 15 minutes. No,

755
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,200
we might have even less time than that.

756
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:57,030
If we miss these 15 minutes,

757
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,100
the mother will be in danger for sure,

758
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,280
and the baby will be in danger too.

759
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:06,610
Please be more focused.

760
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:10,050
We must all endure this!

761
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:14,870
This is the first time I've seen you this nervous since your wedding ceremony.

762
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,280
Now,

763
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,600
stand up please.

764
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,100
Yes.

765
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:04,820
The surgery is starting.

766
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,120
Scalpel.

767
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,010
We're taking out the baby.

768
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,000
Doctor Jung, please prepare the tracheal intubation.

769
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,900
Yes.

770
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,060
Start the counter.

771
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,610
Yes.

772
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,420
Start tracheal intubation.

773
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,280
The intubation is not inserting well.

774
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,700
Give me the tinniest one.

775
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,600
It seems that the neck is much more swollen than it was from yesterday's sonogram.

776
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,830
There's too much difference from the MRI that we took couple of days ago.

777
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,070
In only one to two days,

778
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,600
there's no reason for it to swell!

779
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,350
It's because of the internal bleeding.

780
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:25,170
The impact from the shock of mother's heart, internal hemorrhage occurred in lymphangioma, so the size became larger.

781
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,970
I can't see because of suppressed respiratory tract, and the tube insertion is not going well.

782
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,040
I'll have a try.

783
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,360
Give me stylet.

784
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,470
I think we should hurry and do tracheotomy.

785
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:55,440
The mother, the bleeding started.

786
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,930
Please hurry, Professor Kim.

787
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,500
Scalpel.

788
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,200
Doctor Cha, support here.

789
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:07,410
Yes.

790
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:19,310
Perhaps the intrahematomal is suppressing the respiratory tract...

791
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,000
The amount of the internal acute hemorrhage in lymphangioma is larger than I thought.

792
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,300
-Then the tracheotomy...?
- Can not do that.

793
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,860
You can't do the tracheotomy.

794
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,930
The mother's bleeding got worse.

795
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,620
It's dangerous to continue any further.

796
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,160
The pulse is 120, the blood pressure is going down from 90 to 60.

797
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:53,900
The mother is in danger.

798
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:58,340
We can't delay any longer for uterine contractions. Hurry and bring the Pack RBC<i> [Red blood cell transfusion pack].</i>

799
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,200
Professor, can you just change the direction to do tracheotomy?

800
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,500
No. You can't.

801
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:07,630
No matter where you do incision, the baby can die because of the excessive bleeding.

802
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,200
Professor Kim.

803
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:43,030
<i>♫ My love for you cannot be expressed fully with words ♫</i>

804

<i>You did well today.</i>

808
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,800
<i>You didn't have to do that much.</i>

809
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:00,830
<i>You're starting to get little bit annoying.</i>

810
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:05,100
<i>You can't express your feeling, you can't even confess. It was waste of my time teaching him.</i>

811
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,470
<i>Doctor Park, what are you doing?</i>

812
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:08,130
<i>You said I'm going to be on TV.</i>

813
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,370
<i>You're going to be an operating surgeon.</i>

814
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,220
<i>I don't want to show people embarrassing things.</i>

815
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,420
<i>I'm still lacking a lot.</i>

816
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,610
<i>- Did you come to find me?
- Yes.</i>

817
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,300
<i>Arrest.</i>

818
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,330
<i>What should I do when it's just not working?</i>

819
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,950
<i>You're not a surgeon that treats people with a scalpel.</i>
