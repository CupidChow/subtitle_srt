00:00:-3,000 --> 00:00:01,000
<i>Subtitles brought to you by the Pediatron Team @Viki.</i>

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,940
We're going to trace the fistula from now.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,100
Infection has spread around the thyroid area as well.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,330
But if we do it properly, we won't have to cut his thyroid.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,590
Start dissecting slowly
from where you clearly see the fistula.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,920
Yes.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>Gyu Hyun</i>

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,380
<i>I won't make you throw your dream away. </i>

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,280
<i>This hyung will do that.</i>

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,530
I have finished desquamating the fistula.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,400
Should we ligate here?

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,480
Be careful. If you continue on, you'll reach the front of the cartilage.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,490
It can become difficult to preserve the laryngeal nerve.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,040
Yes. Mixter.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,850
Wait a moment.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,050
Why?

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,290
Gyu Hyun will be able to sing.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,500
We can make Gyu Hyun's dream come true.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,170
Explain.

20
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,010
When we checked the CT scan, it seemed impossible to preserve the laryngeal nerve.

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,200
However, when you look at the direction to which
the fistula is desquamated,

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
and match it up with the image from the esophagography,

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,650
enter a little bit nearer to the laryngopharyngeal cartilage and uppermost bronchus,

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,240
If you twist the thyroid cartilage counterclockwise,

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,310
you can preserve the nerve while ligating the fistula.

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,090
That's correct!

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,390
It is possible to desquamate avoiding the route of the nerve.

28
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,600
Dr. Park has drawn even the nerves below the swollen tissue

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,060
in his mind.

30
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,350
Does that mean Gyu Hyun can sing again?

31
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,300
As long as the surgery ends without any mistakes.

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,670
If he recovers well post surgery without any infection
around the area of operation, that will not be an issue.

33
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,810
Think about the results after the surgery and focus
solely on surgery for the moment.

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,430
I understand!

35
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,460
Let's focus from now on.

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,970
Don't even breathe audibly.

37
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,110
We're going to start desquamation from behind the thyroid cartilage.

38
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,160
Mixter.

39
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,880
Forcep.

40
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,050
The end part of fistula ligation is done.

41
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,450
Great work, Doctor.

42
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,870
Thank you.

43
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,220
Good job, Dr. Park.

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,440
Thank you, Professor.

45
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,280
Dr. Park. Sew it up prettily. Make sure the stitches are even.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,140
Yes.

47
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,530
Dr. Park.

48
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,670
Why don't you say anything?

49
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,610
Because I have nothing to say.

50
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,060
How's that possible?

51
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,460
Don't you usually scold me right after surgery?

52
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,620
Today I have nothing to yell at you about.

53
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,730
It's thanks to Dr. Park Si On.

54
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,880
I more than understand your decision on Dr. Park's specialty.

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,660
Because I can understand why you did it, so very well.

56
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,840
I don't want to tell you how I would wish you to behave.

57
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,720
Instead, let me make one request.

58
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,080
Park Si On,

59
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,300
just judge him as he is.

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,630
Just the way he is.

61
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,750
Excuse me...

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,660
Doctor?

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,640
Are you okay?

64
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,310
Yes.

65
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,860
I was a little dizzy.

66
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,580
I think I was quite nervous.

67
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,760
Why did you get so nervous?

68
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,180
For the first time, I took part in surgery that I've been
watching from the sidelines for a long time.

69
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,150
I was very scared.

70
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,960
In case something would go wrong for the patient.

71
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,750
I feel like I'm a coward,

72
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,730
like a rabbit I used to raise.

73
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,760
What's wrong with a rabbit?

74
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,010
You know the rabbit

75
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,140
is known as a very small and timid animal, right?

76
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,650
But in fact the rabbit has

77
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,550
hind legs that spans twice or thrice as long as the front legs,

78
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,580
he can run at an amazing speed.

79
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,090
So even the predatory animals have a hard time catching the rabbit, they say.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,670
And his smarts?

81
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,630
He didn't lose his liver to the terrapin.
(Old tale on how rabbit outsmarted a terrapin)

82
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,530
A rabbit consumes even his own poop.

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,240
That's true!

84
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,900
Doctor.

85
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,240
A rabbit has relatively the longest hind legs of any species.

86
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,330
So don't just shrink down your body but

87
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,120
run powerfully, like the rabbit.

88
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,110
Thank you.

89
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,900
Your fingernails look pretty comely for a man.

90
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,970
They're shaped like a crescent moon.

91
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm taking off first, then.

92
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,520
Roll your shoulders back.

93
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,630
Are you awake?

94
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,570
Don't speak just for today so you don't strain your throat, okay?

95
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,630
Gyu Hyun. Now you can sing.

96
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,010
Dr. Park found a way, and

97
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,930
the surgery was successful.

98
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,030
So, now you can do what makes you happy, okay?

99
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,310
Don't cry.

100
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,840
If you cry, you'll strain your throat and it'll hurt more.

101
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,610
Oh, there. Dr. Park is coming.

102
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,780
Now the anesthesia wore off, you must feel pain. Right Gyu Hyun?

103
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,740
You did well, Gyu Hyun.

104
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,570
I really don't understand but...

105
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,800
So you can see everything in your head in 3D?

106
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,150
3D is defined to consist of length, width, and height

107
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,070
through the defined x, y, z coordinates,

108
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,970
and means geometrical three-dimensional or space.

109
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,750
But it's not that I see something simple as 3D.

110
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,860
I can perceive 3D objects or space in multiple directions.

111
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,050
What does that mean?

112
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,760
Ordinary people only see this in this state.

113
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,670
But I can...

114
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,510
like this... I can draw it in my head.

115
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,210
Then how do you live if you're dizzy all the time?

116
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,150
It is not always like that.

117
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,150
It's only like that when I focus to perceive it like that.

118
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,860
Then do you also have that kind of skill.

119
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,150
For example, like an X-ray.

120
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,950
You can even figure out the contour of covered parts.

121
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,320
Can you?

122
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,380
Please stand in front of me.

123
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,380
Why you smiling?

124
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,620
It's nothing.

125
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,860
Hey. What exactly are you looking at and laughing about.

126
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,110
Hey! What did you see? What did you look at?

127
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,030
Who on earth could have such an ability?

128
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,320
You! Hmph! Really

129
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,050
How sneaky he is...

130
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,820
<i>And there won't be more a popular doctor than Park Si On.</i>

131
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,940
<i>Even the press will have a huge interest.</i>

132
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,080
<i>It is an international topic.</i>

133
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,780
<i>Please accept Park Si On as he is.</i>

134
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,980
<i>Just as he is.</i>

135
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,440
Guys!

136
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,860
To celebrate the succession of the surgery, I got us something to eat.

137
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,050
You even delivered it yourself. Daebak!

138
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,920
You went through a lot of trouble today. Let's hurry up and eat.

139
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,070
I will eat it well.

140
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,930
I will eat it well. I will eat it well. I will eat it well.

141
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,710
What about Si On's?

142
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,420
Why is one missing?

143
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,460
I think they cut it wrong.

144
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,280
Si On. Let's just share this.

145
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,610
I'm okay.

146
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,290
I'm not hungry at all.

147
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,470
You eat this. I'm not feeling well right now.

148
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,870
The human mixing machine, Hong Gil Nam...

149
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,570
There's even a time where you aren't feeling good.

150
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,210
I'll eat it well.

151
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,580
Park Si On.

152
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,670
Yes, Professor.

153
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,650
Starting tomorrow, be on stand-by 24 hours at the hospital.

154
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,510
Today is the last day you will commute to work.

155
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,900
Then what about calls from outside of our department and ER calls?

156
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,800
Do as a first year residents usually do.

157
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,980
Yes! I'm finally free of night calls.

158
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,250
Hey.

159
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,550
Get on his back.

160
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,380
On his back!

161
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,420
Indian food!
(A punishment phrase for games played in childhood.)

162
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
Who's the person who hit me with the fist?

163
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,400
It hurts.

164
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,340
I heard that you let Dr. Park Si On stay at the Department of Pediatric Surgery.

165
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,410
Yes.

166
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,160
I think that would be good.

167
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,490
Is it because of the way I plan to use Dr. Park?

168
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,260
That's one of the reasons, but the main one is

169
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,320
because of his own will.

170
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,430
That's too bad then.

171
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,740
I offered it to you for a good cause.

172
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,500
In addition, the plan to scout pediatric surgeons from other hospitals,

173
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,880
and the agreement to accept financial support from outside funds, I will postpone it for a bit.

174
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,470
It's more important to find a way to raise our hospital's competitiveness internally first.

175
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,300
We will make the best team on our own first.

176
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,040
When you say 'postpone,' how much more time do I need to give you?

177
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,920
I can't tell you for sure.

178
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,640
I'll be leaving, then.

179
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,790
Professor,

180
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm hoping that that time won't take too long.

181
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,470
Because a person...

182
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,910
tends to calculate the flaws

183
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,610
of the person who makes him wait.

184
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,460
What? Do you have something to say?

185
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,540
Thank you.

186
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,670
For not hating me.

187
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,940
I'll try my best.

188
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,250
I will really try my best.

189
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,490
Throw it here.

190
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,900
I said to throw it.

191
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,420
Where are you going?

192
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,820
Again.

193
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,610
Again...again...again.

194
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,740
You humiliated yourself in front of the NS guys that day right?

195
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,920
One more time you humiliate our department in from of another,

196
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,630
I will kill you. Understand?

197
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,820
Yes.

198
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,320
Go.

199
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,870
Doctor Park!

200
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Congrats congrats!

201
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,880
I heard that starting tomorrow you'll be a true resident.

202
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,330
Why am I so happy?

203
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,590
Thank you.

204
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,820
Doctor Park, I also congratulate you a lot.

205
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,480
I'll stop causing trouble from now on.

206
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,610
Please.

207
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,900
Are you going to just keep staring like that?

208
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,800
It's because today you look cooler than normal.

209
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,900
Even though you are pretty handsome..

210
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,290
I'm glad you know that at least now.

211
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
Wow.

212
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,800
How can you say that without even blinking?

213
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,690
Professor Kim Do Han.

214
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,670
Wow, it's been a long time sunbae.

215
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,530
Hello Professor.

216
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,620
I don't even see the tip of your nose.
(meaning you're so hard to meet up with)

217
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,330
Does it feel good to be doing well?

218
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,800
What do you mean doing well? I'm just busy that's all.

219
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,650
Aigoo

220
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,010
What have you been eating lately to make yourself prettier and prettier?

221
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,670
Because Professor is so nice to me, maybe that's why I'm getting prettier.

222
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh that's right, I have something to discuss with you.

223
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,000
It's congenital lymphangioma.

224
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,820
Yup, it's developed near the head and neck.

225
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,360
The size is pretty big.

226
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,610
How old is the fetus?

227
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,460
A boy, 32 weeks old. It was discovered around the 24th week and it's getting bigger.

228
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,070
I'm worried that the baby's respiratory tract will collapse while giving birth.

229
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,360
I think it'll be okay through EXIT (ex utero intrapartum treatment) procedure.

230
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,930
What's the problem?

231
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,150
The mother's situation is a bit tough.

232
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,690
She's the wife of the eldest son,

233
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,530
and her husband is the only child. It's been like that for 3 generations.

234
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,820
Her father-in-law is a 3 time congressman.

235
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,000
But then,

236
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
the mother-in-law is insisting on the home childbirth.

237
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,720
What about the reason?

238
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,350
As soon as the baby is born

239
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,110
the mother-in-law is going to give the child for adoption.

240
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,360
Pardon?

241
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,200
Why give for adoption?

242
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,240
There are such circumstances sometimes.

243
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,830
When they see in the test that the baby has some abnormalities, the in-laws won't let the women have the baby.

244
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,410
But in this case, they are going for adoption.

245
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,280
That's ridiculous.

246
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,950
It's not even a malformation but a cyst.

247
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,000
This can be completely treated with surgery.

248
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,360
Didn't the doctor from that hospital explain?

249
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,370
They won't listen even after the explanation.

250
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,890
They believe that something will go wrong as the child would grow.

251
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,910
They don't want a stain on their perfect family.

252
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,940
A stain...

253
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,520
What kind of mother-in-law lacks that much common sense?

254
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,190
If the baby is truly malformed,

255
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,420
then it's a problem that the parents would consider.

256
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,980
For the child's future.

257
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,060
However, in this case, a lot went wrong.

258
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,700
That's why the mother gathered up courage and came to our hospital to have the surgery.

259
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,330
But now that she's decided she's hesitating because of her mother-in-law.

260
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,320
Looks like she made her decision today.

261
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,300
Seeing how she came looking for you.

262
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,990
Someone convinced her well.

263
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,020
Who did?

264
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,690
The one that's famous in our hospital. . .

265
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,730
Your department's resident.

266
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,720
What did you tell the mother?

267
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,340
Hurry and tell me!

268
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,240
Professor Kim Do Han of the Pediatric Surgery Department,

269
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,760
will perform the surgery.

270
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,070
Was not what I said.

271
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,320
I told her that she should consult first with the Ob/Gyn Department first.

272
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,660
You followed procedure.

273
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,420
Right, Professor?

274
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,210
What did you tell her to convince her?

275
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,600
<i>I was an autistic child.</i>

276
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,890
<i>But with the help of many people</i>

277
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,290
<i>I was able to surpass my disability.</i>

278
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,520
<i>Though I haven't recovered completely yet.</i>

279
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,710
<i>But still, I've become a lot better.</i>

280
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,730
<i>That's why now,</i>

281
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,000
<i>I'm on my way to becoming a doctor.</i>

282
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,420
<i>But your baby,</i>

283
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,860
<i>we just need to remove the cyst.</i>

284
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,870
<i>It's not a difficult disability to fix.</i>

285
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,990
<i>If the surgery goes well,</i>

286
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,120
<i>the baby would be able to grow healthily.</i>

287
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,400
I just said up to that.

288
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,360
Can she. . .

289
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,820
be able to get the surgery?

290
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,900
She said she's going bring her mother-in-law tomorrow so we'll have to see after we talk.

291
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,860
Dr. Cha, prepare the reference materials.

292
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,400
So that we could explain simply to the guardian tomorrow.

293
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,890
Yes, Professor.

294
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,130
Dr. Park,

295
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,730
Since today is the last time you could go home, we can't just let it pass by, right?

296
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,410
Then, what should we do?

297
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,340
How about we eat something special today?

298
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,300
Could it be that you'll be making something again?

299
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,930
Hey!

300
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,370
What's wrong with your expression?

301
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,480
Don't worry! I won't be cooking!

302
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,900
What do you say to a traditional Korean dinner?

303
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,980
Traditional Korean dinner? How many dishes will it have?

304
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,790
How many dishes?

305
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,800
FIve dishes were for ordinary citizens who have the means.
 Seven to nine dishes were for

306
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,030
noble families and 12 dishes were for the king's royal table.

307
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,090
I personally would like to eat above seven dishes.

308
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,890
Ah, is that so? Seven dishes?

309
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,010
Then do you want to get hit seven times before we eat?

310
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,030
Then, five dishes.

311
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,270
I'll just get hit five times.

312
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,000
By the way, there's someone who will be eating with us.

313
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Hello.

314
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,180
Dr. Park,

315
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,860
has now really become a resident.

316
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,000
He's also being acknowledged by people.

317
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,320
Yes.

318
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,330
He knows a lot of things so the sunbaes and hoobaes are very surprised at times.

319
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,450
After a few years, he will become a skilled surgeon.

320
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,250
If your parents would know,

321
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,990
they would be happy.

322
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,170
Very happy.

323
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,450
You should also eat, Ahjummoni.

324
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,900
I'm good.

325
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,310
You should eat a lot.

326
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,640
What's the matter, Dr. Park?

327
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,490
It's nothing.

328
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,530
Doctor,

329
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,420
follow your respectable sunbaes

330
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,100
and I hope you become a good doctor.

331
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,400
Yes.

332
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,420
I follow Dr. Cha's instructions well.

333
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,350
And I will become a good doctor.

334
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,130
I promised my hyung.

335
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,130
Excuse me.

336
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,170
You're here.

337
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Why did you accept Dr. Park Si On again?

338
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,950
The baggage that you don't need to carry,

339
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,800
why are you carrying?

340
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,650
Let's stop talking about that.

341
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,900
What should I stop again?

342
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,620
When you don't even think of me at the least bit.

343
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,900
Do you know what I am doing for your sake?

344
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
What do you mean?

345
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,040
The suspension on hospital funds was my doing.

346
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,300
It's my first step of making Chairman Lee step down.

347
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,520
I also cut off Executive Director Lee.

348
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,190
- You. . .
- That's right!

349
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm going to be the chairman.

350
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,790
After getting good financial support and raising our hospital, I'm going to make you the director.

351
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
So that no one would be able to mess with you.

352
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,250
The things that you said just now, are those true?

353
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,830
Yes.

354
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,770
There will be more in the future.

355
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,190
How could you do those things?

356
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,800
And Chairman Lee as the opponent at that?

357
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,490
Someday you will understand me.

358
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,310
That's enough so quit it immediately.

359
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,660
Tomorrow, immediately.

360
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,900
I won't.

361
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,090
Chae Gyeong.

362
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,520
You always tell me this,

363
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,610
Not to meddle with your work.

364
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,500
This is my rule.

365
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,290
Don't meddle.

366
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,780
Alright, I won't meddle.

367
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,810
But then,

368
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,090
If you won't stop immediately. . .

369
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,280
Don't think you would be able to see me again.

370
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,810
Earlier, you. . .

371
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,880
when ahjummoni gave you the side dish

372
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,210
why did you hesitate?

373
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,450
That. . .

374
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,420
I felt like it was something I saw in my dream.

375
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,510
Something like deja vu?

376
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,620
No. It's not like that.

377
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,620
I don't know how to explain it exactly.

378
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,920
Then from now on, continue thinking about what happened today.

379
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,600
Something else might come up.

380
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,130
Yes.

381
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,180
Oh, right!

382
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,630
Before you become formally on call tomorrow, there's something I need to confirm.

383
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Dr. Park Si On,

384
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,060
What is a doctor to you?

385
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,900
The last hope.

386
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,000
Even when everyone else gives up on the patient,

387
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,300
the last one responsible for the patient is the doctor.

388
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,720
Nice!

389
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,020
Then what is a patient to you?

390
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,140
It's a friend I need to be separated from.

391
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,170
A patient is someone I need to treat like a friend,

392
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,650
and someone whom I need to help live healthily even after being separated from me, that's a patient.

393
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,840
So that they won't seek me again.

394
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,980
Nice! Nice!

395
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,850
Si On.

396
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,180
The change in you is not because of anyone else.

397
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,200
You learned it on your own.

398
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,930
So,

399
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,840
now believe in yourself more. Okay?

400
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,810
♫ <i>You look good</i> ♫

401
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,340
♫ <i>Please smile more</i> ♫

402
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:23,500
Now that I look at it, you haven't had hiccups all day today.

403
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,290
Oh, I-

404
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,890
I know, right.

405
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,030
There is a 12-years-old with abdominal distention at the ER.

406
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,840
She's been on NPO since yesterday and there is rebound tenderness.

407
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,030
I gave her pain medication and asked for a sono preparation.

408
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,510
What's with you, taking notes and all?

409
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,370
In order to remember the patient's state in detail, I need to take notes.

410
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,460
Hello.

411
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,880
Ah, hello.

412
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,380
You know who I am right?

413
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,460
Yes, you are the General Manager Yoo Chae Gyeong of the Dept. of Business Planning.

414
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,600
Are you glad that you got to stay
 at the Department of Pediatric Surgery?

415
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,310
Yes. I'm very glad.

416
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:33,130
I'm as happy as the first day that I got to buy a plamodel robot after saving enough of my allowance.

417
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,760
Don't cause any more trouble from now on.

418
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,350
If anything, at least for Prof. Kim Do Han who let you stay.

419
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,890
Do my words offend you?

420
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,320
No, no they don't.

421
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,810
It's just that I don't understand.

422
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,140
What do you not understand?

423
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,270
To do something 'for' someone.

424
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:58,850
I don't know the meaning of that word yet.

425
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,600
Please teach me sometime later.

426
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,190
You look very tired today.

427
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,030
No.

428
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,090
What do you mean, no? You definitely
 look like you have no energy at all.

429
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,340
Cha Yoon Seo.

430
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,790
Yes?

431
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,570
What do you think doing something 'for' someone is?

432
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,740
That's such a vague question.

433
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,680
Do you mean between a man and a woman
 or between co-workers?

434
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,500
If I had to choose,

435
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
between a man and a woman.

436
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,780
It's because you haven't been paying much attention to General Manager Yoo that you feel bad, right?

437
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,960
Well, I haven't been in a relationship to know from experience,

438
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,950
but doing something 'for' someone

439
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,070
is when you keep an eye on them.

440
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,750
Not ignorance or neglect,

441
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,650
but literally just watching them.

442
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,230
But truthfully, it's the hardest thing to do.

443
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,610
Although it's difficult, it does help the relationship to stay strong for a long period of time.

444
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,930
Are you keeping an eye on me?

445
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,430
Sorry?

446
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,730
Not as a man and a woman.

447
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,510
As a coworker.

448
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,760
Oh...

449
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,100
You already know well that I bother you a lot
 even though I'm on a second year fellow.

450
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,090
But, you know what?

451
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:13,000
I do bother you a lot, but you always come to the right conclusion.

452
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,490
Embarrassing the one who is bothersome.

453
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:20,340
So, I always end up succumbing.

454
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,470
Thank you,

455
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,230
for succumbing at least by the end.

456
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,940
Do you really have to do this?

457
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,320
I already mentioned it to you before.

458
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,570
Even though I step down from being the Director,
 I'm still a doctor.

459
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,690
And I will stay by your side, Chairman Lee.

460
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,950
Executive Director Lee is gone now, so there isn't anyone who will bother you anymore.

461
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,300
Assistant Director won't be able to do much
without the Executive Director either.

462
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,430
That and my resigning are different matters.
Please accept my resignation.

463
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,790
Director.

464
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,470
Well, I won't be leaving any time soon.

465
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,990
I have to finish my business,

466
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,040
and see that the Assistant Director is replaced.
Then I will leave.

467
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,690
The Assistant Director,

468
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,120
it's best that we do this, right?

469
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,680
He is skilled,

470
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,670
but I don't think he fits at a hospital.

471
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,550
Please take care of it the way you see fit, Director.

472
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,380
Okay.

473
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,390
Sunbaenim,

474
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,200
what's the main difference between
 gastroschisis and omphalocele?

475
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,350
Oh, the difference is...

476
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,230
Hey, Seon Joo.

477
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:43,730
As an intern, you should not have to go into this much detail.

478
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,430
You didn't even choose your department yet.

479
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,450
I'm just curious because there are two babies at the NICU that have these diagnosis.

480
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,090
It won't be too late to know when you're a resident.

481
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,790
I've never seen a good student come out of studying outside of what they need to know.

482
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,720
Uhm Sunbae-nim,

483
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,200
Yes?

484
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,150
By any chance, do you know the difference between the two?

485
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,410
They're similar in that the shape and location of the navel are normal,

486
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,550
and due to small absence of tissue at the top of the navel, the small or large intestines stick out of the belly button.

487
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,740
But in gastroschisis, the bowels are not covered by any sac

488
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,820
and is more frequent in low birth weight babies or premature babies.

489
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,790
Ah, I see.

490
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,490
By the way, Sunbaenim,
why do you speak in a respectful tone to me?

491
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,670
Ah, it's because

492
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,360
it's my first time talking to you, Hoobaenim.

493
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,880
I guess it is.

494
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,190
From now, you can speak to me informally.

495
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,140
Yes (formal). Ah, sure (informal).

496
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,910
Ah, about these two. There are differences
in their cure and prognosis too, right?

497
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,350
Hey Sunbae, about Si On. Don't you think he's changed in the past one or two days?

498
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,250
He was like a child and felt out of place for a while.

499
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,960
It's not that he's changed, but don't you think he's gone back to the state when he first arrived here?

500
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,650
Gone back?

501
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,160
It's my personal opinion,

502
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,140
but before he first arrived at this hospital,

503
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,130
he was at a state where he knew how to control himself.

504
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,350
When he was saving that child at the train station,
 and when he saved Seong Ho.

505
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:43,710
But there wasn't anything he could do at our extremely strict and top-notch hospital.

506
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,800
He was always stopped from what he wanted to do because we looked down on him and were suspicious of his skills.

507
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,390
So naturally, he withdrew.

508
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,430
Thinking back to when he first came, I think you're right, Sunbae.

509
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,020
Probably.

510
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,060
But this time, after Gyu Hyun's surgery, I think he was able to overcome his state.

511
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,030
He regained confidence

512
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,920
and was acknowledged too.

513
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,020
Hey, you jerks!

514
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,210
Are you not going greet me correctly to show your respect?

515
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,360
Okay.

516
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,190
Hello.

517
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,060
Hey!

518
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,320
Why are you overdoing your greeting?

519
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,410
It's not overdone. I did it because you're a respectful manager.

520
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,980
After seeing your hand, Manager, I've decided to respect you.

521
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,360
Well...

522
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,210
This kid, why does he keep talking about my hand?

523
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,520
Even after surgery, the child's head shape can change as he grows up, right?

524
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,840
As I said, it's not a deformative change.

525
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,550
There will not be a big problem to the child's growth or his intelligence.

526
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,060
How can you guarantee that? There is such thing as "what if."

527
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,830
If you have to consider the "what if" cases, there are endless possibilities.

528
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,590
It's the same for other illnesses also.

529
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,590
That's enough.

530
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,110
My daughter-in-law will give birth at home.

531
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,610
I heard you're going to put the child for adoption.

532
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,860
But that means you're going to give up the child.

533
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,790
The expectant mother wishes to give birth and raise her child.

534
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,060
Isn't that right, Ms. Lee Soo Jin?

535
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,780
Please do not interfere any longer.

536
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,540
With our family doctor, we will take care of it.

537
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,770
How many times do we have to tell you that it's not a disability?

538
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,220
Dr. Cha.

539
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,360
The child just has a cyst. He is not disabled.

540
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,880
And even if he had a disability,

541
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,550
Mother-in-law, you have no right to do whatever you want with a life.

542
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,970
How dare you be rude like this?

543
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,860
Stand up.

544
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,790
Are you not going to stand up quickly?

545
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,280
Please consider this one more time. This child needs to receive a surgery.

546
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,580
I have no doubt to reconsider.

547
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,120
Let's go.

548
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,270
Soo Jin.

549
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,470
Soo Jin.

550
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,610
That's enough, Dr. Cha.

551
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,670
Hello.

552
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,150
Did you decide to receive surgery?

553
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,660
Why did you say unnecessary things to our kid?

554
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,060
She needs to receive surgery. Quickly, quickly, it must be done.

555
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,610
You don't even seem normal.

556
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,950
You can't even fix your own health issues, so how are you going to fix others?

557
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,590
I'm sorry, Doctor.

558
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,170
I'm really sorry.

559
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,940
Excuse me, expectant mother.

560
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,340
Yes, Doctor?

561
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,400
Don't cry.

562
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,550
If you cry, there are a lot of people who will be sad.

563
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,330
But when a baby is born crying,

564
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,570
many people will be happy.

565
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,510
Why aren't you getting on the car?

566
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,490
Thank you, Doctor.

567
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,870
Stop shaking.

568
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,050
I'm sorry.

569
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,400
Doc!

570
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,780
How did you know to come here and see me?

571
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,910
How can I not know here when I've been in this hospital for how many years?

572
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,560
--So you'll be staying at the hospital 24 hours, right?
--Yeah

573
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,650
I feel like we're living together in the same house.

574
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,490
That's In Hae, isn't she?

575
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,490
Why did you come all the way here?

576
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,740
By looking at the backside, that's totally Doc Hong.

577
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,440
Why are you sleeping so much? It's only early evening.

578
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,610
Who cares!

579
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,780
Doc Hong, I see your underpants!

580
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,570
Man...

581
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,750
Your butt hole ate your pants.

582
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,170
It ate a lot of them.

583
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,040
Man...

584
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,990
Do you still hiccup when you see her?

585
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,520
No.

586
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,380
It's not hiccup...

587
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,500
Does your heart beat fast?

588
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,890
Yes, you're right.

589
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,840
You've finally reached the second phase.

590
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,930
Second phase?

591
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,740
Yep. Heartache.

592
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,720
The diagnosis is "love sickness."

593
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,520
Is that disease like this?

594
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,810
What to do... Your symptoms will only get worse.

595
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,420
Aren't you going to confess to her?

596
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,050
"I like you," "I love you," like this.

597
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,070
I can't.

598
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,430
I don't know much about liking or loving.

599
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:58,970
Why don't you know? What you're feeling now is just that.

600
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:02,510
If you really can't, express in some other way.

601
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,020
"You're pretty," "You're beautiful."

602
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,360
Those are the words I say to you, too.

603
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,530
But it's different from what you say to her.

604
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,150
I'm so frustrated!

605
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:13,300
Aren't they the same?

606
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,950
They're 100% different.

607
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,390
If you can't confess, you express it.

608
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,550
It's okay for you to get goosebumps. You express it no matter what.

609
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,330
Express it.

610
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,070
But then... whoever she is, I do feel envious.

611
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,790
You know there's a saying.

612
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,070
The best miracle out of all miracles is

613
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,170
making the heart of the person you love beat.

614
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,860
Dong Soo has become a lot healthier.

615
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,140
You're right. He's almost normal now.

616
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:29,520
Why do you sigh when he's healthy?

617
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,840
You know that pregnant woman...

618
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,940
Ms. Lee Soo Jin.

619
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,620
I keep thinking about her.

620
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,060
Ah, yes.

621
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,850
Ms. Lee Soo Jin.

622
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,280
There's not much we can do.

623
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,430
We can only do something if she's admitted to our hospital and we can care for her.

624
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,460
It's not like we can go outside the hospital and persuade the patient.

625
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,720
...

626
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,540
I... would like you to persuade her.

627
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,520
No.

628
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,850
No matter what, there's definitely something called a line.

629
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,100
Which is a different issue from the hospital rules or principles.

630
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,380
Respecting a patient's decision whether I like it or not.

631
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,260
But this time...

632
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,730
it's not so easy to respect it.

633
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:27,370
You have a very pretty heart.

634
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,340
The director of the orphanage I was in told me.

635
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,640
A pretty heart is like pollen in the way that

636
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,210
it always flies somewhere and makes flowers blossom.

637
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,500
I wish it would fly far like the director said.

638
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,630
It will fly...

639
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,910
very far way.

640
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,780
<i>When you cry, a lot of people become sad.</i>

641
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,680
<i>But when babies cry when they're born,</i>

642
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,030
<i>a lot of people will be happy.</i>

643
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,740
You got a permission from your mother-in-law, right?

644
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,180
I don't need a permission.

645
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,420
Because it's my child.

646
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,860
How about your husband?

647
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,120
He's in the U.S.

648
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,480
He'll only be able to come back at the end of the year.

649
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,770
But it doesn't matter to ask.

650
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:08,690
Because he listens to whatever his mother says.

651
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:12,960
Your mother-in-law won't just sit and do nothing when she finds out, though.

652
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,670
That's fine.

653
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,510
That doesn't change my decision.

654
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:26,040
Then we will respect your decision.

655
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,440
How about you, Professor Min?

656
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,830
I, too, respect it.

657
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,570
It's all thank to the resident doctor.

658
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:41,620
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have been able to bring up this courage.

659
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,310
I really thank him.

660
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,420
You couldn't sleep?

661
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,910
No.

662
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:19,570
At dawn, traffic accident, fall injury patients, and a patient with possible hernia all came in simultaneously.

663
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,850
Wow, your first all nighter was quite tough.

664
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,180
Luckily, none of their conditions were serious.

665
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,870
No surgery was needed.

666
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,120
Park Si On.

667
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,250
I think you're right.

668
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,390
The pollen.

669
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,320
The pollen.

670
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,310
Pollen?

671
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:06,990
I will brief the exit procedure for Lee Soo Jin.

672
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,140
First, with a c-section,

673
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,510
we will pull just the baby's upper body out.

674
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,730
Doctor Sung.

675
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,400
Then, we'll immediately secure the air by airway intubation

676
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,140
and then cut the umbilical cord, and quickly perform the delivery.

677
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:30,250
What's important here is that we're only going to have 30 minutes for this whole process.

678
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,910
We will suppress uterine contraction with Ritodrine and Nytroglycerin,

679
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,940
but the duration cannot exceed 30 minutes.

680
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,850
If it exceeds that amount of time, the pregnant woman will be in danger.

681
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,360
There's a risk of metrorrhagia,

682
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,300
and if the bleeding continues,

683
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,470
she could die from hypovolemic shock.

684
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,740
30 minutes duration seems long, but it's definitely not.

685
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,630
Airway intubation will not be easy on this baby.

686
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:05,060
In many of the past cases, it either took more than 30 minutes, or it was impossible altogether.

687
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,150
If we fail at the airway intubation, do we need to perform tracheostomy?

688
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,640
That's correct.

689
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,540
That needs to be done very quickly.

690
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,950
I have a question.

691
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:24,050
If we fail at the airway intubation and tracheostomy needs to be performed,

692
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:28,100
but due to the lesion of lymphangioma, the access to the trachea gets difficult,

693
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,260
or due to sudden internal bleeding of lymphangioma,

694
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,450
the tracheostomy gets difficult, then what do we need to do?

695
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,400
That could happen, but as you can see on the upper MRI,

696
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,730
on the front side of trachea, I barely see any lesion.

697
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,580
What if a sudden bleeding occurs and it causes edema...

698
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,460
Doctor Park.

699
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,090
Sit down.

700
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,610
Once we succeed in airway intubation, we must immediately perform a surgery to remove the lymphoma.

701
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:05,770
Normally, we perform the surgery after ensuring baby's stability after moving it to the NICU,

702
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:09,920
but in this baby's case, we cannot postpone the time.

703
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,350
I have a question.

704
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:26,410
If, this is just if, really really if,

705
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,910
a sudden unexpected thing happens, and the mother or the baby,

706
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,230
if we're put in a situation where we can only save one of them,

707
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,090
who do we need to save?

708
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:47,540
In the last 25 years, there was no pregnant woman who died during delivery in our hospital.

709
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,010
However, if such a situation occurs,

710
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,330
we have to save the mother. That's the priority.

711
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,880
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

712
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:17,870
Our Maknae (youngest/rookie) is little imprudent.

713
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,900
No. Not at all.

714
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,920
It was very interesting.

715
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,880
How could a 1st year resident know so well all of the possible variables?

716
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,910
He's a bit special in some way.

717
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,210
Thank you if you take it in that way.

718
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:34,960
Train him well,

719
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,490
if you do well,
he will become Kim Do Han Jr.

720
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,240
Aigoo, seriously!!

721
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,820
Even if you want to ask questions,
you should check the situation first!

722
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,410
During the conference
where all other professors attended...

723
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:54,260
I had more questions,
but restrained myself.

724
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,510
My heart was almost bursting
while watching you (asking those questions)!

725
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,790
You asked about all the worst scenarios.

726
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,650
I was not asking about the worst scenarios,

727
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,830
but the situations I saw from the research papers.

728
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:09,550
Then, answer me yourself,

729
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,660
if you have to save only one of those two,

730
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,880
which one will you save?

731
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,480
Which one I will save...

732
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,700
DOCTOR PARK!!!

733
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,150
Yes.

734
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:27,360
Go get some sleep for only one hour!

735
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,510
Starting from now, for only one hour.

736
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,190
Thank you.

737
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:34,130
Go quickly and sleep.

738
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:41,220
I don't think that both the manager
and the cleanup hitter will be placated.

739
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,290
I'm sorry.

740
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,170
Even if we wait more,
I don't think there will be any improvement.

741
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,330
Yes...

742
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,960
I think now is the time for you to come.

743
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:45,660
<i>Si Deok...</i>

744
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,990
<i>Si Deok... Si Deok...</i>

745
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,690
<i>I'm sorry, Si Deok.</i>

746
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,310
<i>Si Deok, I'm sorry.</i>

747
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,640
<i>Si Deok...</i>

748
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,770
I'm sorry...?

749
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,260
I'm sorry...

750
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,250
Yes, Professor.

751
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,460
... you can sort it out in that way.
Then please keep up with your work.

752
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,060
Yes.

753
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,130
Don't worry too much, please.

754
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,720
The best collaborating medical team
will perform this surgery.

755
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,980
I'm not worried.

756
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,420
I trust your team, Doctor.

757
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,710
Please endure just a little bit more.

758
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:29,450
A few days later, you will cry not because you're sad,

759
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,210
but because you're so happy.

760
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:36,280
What are you trying to do now!?

761
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:01,320
You must know how big your handicap is.

762
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,790
Yes.

763
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:05,930
To overcome it,

764
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,410
just doing well isn't enough.

765
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,510
For you to get recognized,

766
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,630
there is something you must do.

767
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:21,260
Surpass me.

768
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,400
Since you're just a resident,

769
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,700
I fully understand that you're in a situation where you can't even be an assistant, let alone do a surgery.

770
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,290
But other than that,

771
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,290
you must excel more than me.

772
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,760
So much so as to force other people
not see your handicap.

773
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:44,330
But... there are still
too many thing I don't know.

774
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,670
And how can I excel more than you, Professor?

775
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:51,470
I'm just telling you the way you can remain in this hospital.

776
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,190
Yes.

777
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,190
I got it.

778
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,270
Damn...

779
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,550
Excuse me!

780
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,490
Damn!

781
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,540
Stop there!

782
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,460
You can't take her in this way!

783
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,200
How can you drag
a pregnant woman by force?

784
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,610
Won't you let go of her!?

785
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:44,450
Let go!

786
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:49,310
I said let go of her hand!

787
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,910
Aish, seriously...

788
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,900
What are you doing now?

789
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,830
Madam, are you always taking care
of the situation in this kind of manner?

790
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,690
Don't meddle
but go take care of your work.

791
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,090
This is our work,

792
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,220
protecting our patient!

793
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,250
Take her.

794
01:02:06,250 --> 01:02:08,840
You can never take her!

795
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,630
You have to stay in this hospital.

796
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,980
Never, never, never can leave!

797
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,270
You guys, do you want to take off that gown?
<i>(implying "losing their jobs in the hospital")</i>

798
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:24,150
If you can do, go ahead.

799
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,790
I... will not go with you.

800
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,920
I will give birth to my baby here,

801
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,330
and have the surgery done.

802
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,990
Is that so?

803
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:41,790
Then, get the surgery
after getting a divorce.

804
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:48,310
If you give birth to the baby here,
I won't take care of either you or the baby.

805
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:52,280
Fine, I will do that.

806
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:57,910
I don't want to raise my baby
in this kind of family either...

807
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,290
This mother-to-be... she's in danger!

808
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,400
Miss Soo Jin!

809
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,510
Move her to the treatment room now!
Take her EKG quickly, and bring a photograph.

810
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,400
Quickly!

811
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:47,170
<i>♪ Telling you about my love cannot be completed, ♪</i>

812
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:55,200
<i>♪ Even with all the world, my love is not enough. ♪</i>
