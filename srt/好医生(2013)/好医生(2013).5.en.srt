2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,210
She was brought here with intussusception
diagnosis, so we called for you.

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,270
She's had stomach pains and hematochezia
since 10 hours ago. She is dehydrated.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,070
Run a blood test.
And arrange for an emergency operation.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,630
Are you in your right mind?
It's already too late.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,400
As soon as you open her up,
she will go into cardiac arrest!

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,080
I will perform the surgery.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,300
You better stop now!

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,830
This is my last warning.

10
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,490
The surgeon, Cha Yoon Seo,
will start the surgery.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,780
One more.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,440
The child is not moving well.

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,020
It's cardiac arrest!

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,540
I will give her atropine.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,990
One, two, three.

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,950
50 joules.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,390
Move out of the way!
Shock!

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,740
- It's dropping again!
- Raise to 100 joules.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,840
Shock!

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,190
The rhythm's not coming back.

21
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,420
Please...

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,060
Please...

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,470
Professor Kim.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,920
Please...

25
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,400
Please hang in there.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,840
Just a bit more.

27
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,230
- Dr. Cha...
- Be quiet!

28
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,970
Dr. Cha, that's enough.

29
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,440
Get out!
Get me the defibrillator!

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,380
Dr. Han.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,870
Close her up,
and move her to the ICU.

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,670
Report the death to the guardians.

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,210
Just wait!

34
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,750
What are you doing?

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,670
We'll wrap up.

36
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,320
I told you not to!

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,630
You did what you could!

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,570
Leave me alone.

39
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,130
Please...

40
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,380
Except for the ones who can't accept
the death, leave the operating room.

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,560
Get out!

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,600
Dr. Jung and the nurses,
you should leave, too.

43
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,040
Park Shi On.

44
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,080
Park Shi On!

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,600
Come here.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,590
Get over here!

47
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,800
Close her up.

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,420
And move the body to the ICU.

49
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,780
Doctor.

50
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,400
It was too late.

51
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,720
Min Hee.

52
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,150
Min Hee!

53
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,910
Min Hee...
My daughter...

54
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,540
How can you say so easily
that she's dead?

55
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,510
Why did you let her die?

56
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,090
If you operated on her,
you should have saved her.

57
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,070
Why did you do that?

58
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,580
You call yourself a doctor?

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,610
Someone who kills a person
is a doctor?

60
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,170
Please calm down.
We did our best.

61
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,850
My child died.

62
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,490
My baby died!

63
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,080
We understand that you are upset,
but it's not her fault.

64
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,460
It was already too late
when she arrived here.

65
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,940
Shut up!

66
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm going to sue all of you!

67
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,900
My Min Hee...

68
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,170
You made my Min Hee die.

69
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,460
I'm sorry, Min Hee...

70
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,190
It's mommy's fault...

71
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm sorry, Min Hee.

72
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,240
<i>My heart aches, I am crying again</i>

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,650
<i>As I hold my torn heart alone</i>

74
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,940
Leave it.

75
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,150
I'll do it.

76
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,940
<i>My silent pain grows even bigger</i>

77
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:43,090
<i> Without a word, I cried</i>

78
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,750
<i>A. Immediate Cause of Death -
Septicemia / respiratory failure.
B. Predisposing factor - necrotizing enteritis</i>

79
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,930
That's why I said we should have
transferred her to another hospital!

80
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,910
That's easy to say.

81
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,150
That would be like
leaving her to die on the way.

82
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,370
Professor Kim, don't you know
that this will cause a problem?

83
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,370
The parents will sue us
for malpractice.

84
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,260
We should turn down a patient
out of fear of getting sued?

85
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,740
Dr. Cha tried her best.

86
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,250
How frustrating...

87
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,540
And who will acknowledge that?

88
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,330
You think the parents who just lost
their child are going to understand that?

89
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,980
Is that why you pushed the surgery
onto a doctor without any experience?

90
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,210
What do you mean?

91
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,820
I didn't allow for that surgery.

92
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,330
Cha Yoon Seo went on her own...

93
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,360
You think it's right for a doctor
to pick and choose his patients?

94
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,260
How dare you...

95
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,030
How can you say that?

96
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,110
That's all I can say...

97
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,100
What are you doing there?

98
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,330
I was sewing up Min Hee's clothes.

99
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,560
Why would you do that?

100
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,050
I think she would be embarrassed
if she wore this on her way to heaven.

101
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,380
Dying is not about going to
a different place.

102
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,550
It's the end of a life.

103
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,850
That's not true.
My rabbit and my brother are there, too.

104
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,550
We couldn't save the patient.
And she died.

105
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,170
That's the whole truth.

106
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,260
What you are doing now...

107
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,500
That's not helping Min Hee, at all.

108
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,010
It's just a selfish act
to make yourself feel better.

109
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,380
No.
I'm helping out Min Hee.

110
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,000
If you wanted to help her,
you should have saved her!

111
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,550
I don't consider you a doctor.

112
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,720
But if you are a real doctor,
you shouldn't be saying these things.

113
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
Losing a family member...

114
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,280
and dying when you don't have to...

115
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,030
That's everlasting pain
for the remaining family members.

116
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,130
And...

117
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,890
no consolation can undo that pain.

118
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,170
Never.

119
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,540
No, I'm sure there is a heaven.

120
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,280
Fine.

121
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,290
You believe in that.

122
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,460
And don't forget that
your belief will make you into a fool.

123
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,380
<i>I know that people take me
as a fool.</i>

124
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,170
<i>When I was young...
and still now...</i>

125
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,430
<i>That's why I'm okay.</i>

126
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,660
Min Hee...

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,380
Min Hee...

128
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,970
Min Hee, I'm sorry.

129
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,770
What do I do?
My poor Min Hee...

130
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,840
This is all Park Shi On's fault.

131
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,130
If it weren't for him, Professor Kim
wouldn't have been suspended.

132
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,440
He would have performed the surgery.

133
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,130
And this wouldn't have
happened to Dr. Cha.

134
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,330
Stop making excuses.

135
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,340
Even if the professor performed the surgery,
nothing would have changed.

136
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,570
I'm not making excuses.

137
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,060
Nothing's been going well since
he came here.

138
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,330
Woo Il Kyu!

139
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,020
If Park Shi On does something wrong,
it's okay to scold him.

140
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,100
But, making him responsible for
something that's not his fault...

141
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,660
I will not allow you to do that.
Do you understand?

142
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay, I understand.

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,350
What's going on?

144
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,630
Go back to your stations.

145
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,870
I will go back to the NICU.

146
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,230
Make sure that Dong Soo
is pooping well.

147
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,010
Yes.

148
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,870
Okay.

149
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,220
It's nothing.

150
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,680
Please put a temporary lift
on my suspension.

151
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,210
I will receive the punishment later
at an appropriate time.

152
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,460
Fine.

153
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,390
In this situation,
I'm sure the board will understand.

154
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,520
Thank you.

155
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm sure the child's parents
are very upset.

156
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,210
This happened again...

157
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,180
Even if one hospital had a
pediatrics department...

158
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,330
Even if they had a pediatrics department,
there aren't enough doctors.

159
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,000
If there's an emergency, they would only
have interns or residents available.

160
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,730
They would have to turn away
the patient.

161
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,920
Did they take the child's body?

162
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,170
No.

163
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,840
I think it will be sent to the
funeral parlor.

164
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,170
Is Dr. Cha okay?

165
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,390
Yes.

166
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,730
It was her first surgery,
and she lost a child like that.

167
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,080
She must be very hurt.

168
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,570
I thought Dr. Cha was in charge
of the surgery.

169
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,060
Shouldn't she be the one
taking care of the aftermath?

170
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,920
I'm sorry,
but I need to stay here.

171
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:15,210
- You're on suspension right now.
- It's been deferred.

172
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,230
What?

173
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,780
I need to take care of this.
And Dr. Ch is very upset.

174
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,890
The manager can take care
of the aftermath.

175
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,980
And Dr. Cha is not a child!

176
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,260
She can't control herself?

177
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,910
Please understand this time.

178
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,810
I'll send the car with Mr. Choi.

179
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,080
Fine.

180
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,350
I'm hanging up.

181
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,630
Get up, Dr. Park.

182
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,750
You can't stay here like this.

183
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,770
Yeah, what if Professor Kim
finds out?

184
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,920
Let's go eat.
I'm sure you didn't eat breakfast.

185
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,110
Yes.

186
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,820
You're always acting up.
Get up!

187
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,440
Yes, I understand.

188
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,530
There's an 8 year old girl in the ER who's
been having stomach pains for three days.

189
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,630
The pain is on the lower right side.

190
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,890
WBC count is 12,000.
CRP is 3.

191
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,130
We have to go,
but you have to get up soon, okay?

192
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,230
Do you have the CMV results
for Ye Eun?

193
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,810
No, I think it will be ready
after lunch.

194
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,460
Please check Yoo Jin's
drainage amount.

195
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,490
Hey!
She's really something else.

196
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,640
It was her first surgery,
and the child died.

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,310
How can she be so fine?

198
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,100
How can you read her so well?

199
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,160
You think you can see her
emotions externally?

200
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,940
You think it's obvious
like a wound or bleeding?

201
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,270
The pain is in the lower right side.

202
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,650
We ordered a blood test
because of her vomiting.

203
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,710
We suspect appendicitis from looking
at the increase in white blood cells.

204
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,820
Mesenteric lymphadenitis or a
simple enteritis may cause similar symptoms.

205
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,670
Don't jump to any conclusions.

206
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,640
Take an image and a sonogram.

207
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,610
- After a diagnosis is made, prepare for surgery.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
Where's Dr. Cha?

209
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,440
We didn't notify her, yet.

210
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,890
Why not?

211
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,890
I told him not to. I thought
she would need time to recuperate.

212
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,780
Who put you in charge?

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,040
I'm sorry.

214
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,840
Why are you here?

215
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,770
This is not a place for you to be,
so go.

216
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,240
I was always there.

217
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,210
Even when my childhood bunny
and my brother went to heaven.

218
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,800
It's scary to be here.

219
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,370
But, I don't want my bunny, my brother,
or Min Hee to be alone.

220
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,840
I hate that more than
being scared.

221
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,190
What I hate is when you
act like a child.

222
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,830
Do you also believe that
there's no heaven?

223
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,520
Yes, there's no such thing.

224
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,550
That's what Professor Kim Do Han
said as well.

225
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,230
That there's no heaven.

226
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,310
That's what the family and friends
of dead people believe in.

227
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,300
But to us, it's just a useless word.

228
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,070
To the kids...

229
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,830
Heaven is being alive.

230
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:44,340
Being loved by their mom and dad...

231
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,280
Playing with their friends...

232
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,490
We took away heaven from Min Hee.

233
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,100
That's not true.

234
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm sure Min Hee would be
grateful to you.

235
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,650
When I was an intern at Choon Chun,
something like this happened three times.

236
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,810
Everyone gave up,
and didn't have the surgery.

237
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,190
They returned all three patients.

238
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,270
You're the first one who performed
the surgery without turning her down.

239
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,950
The director once told me...

240
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,350
'Curing a patient is important...

241
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,400
but giving a chance for a patient
to live is just as important.'

242
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,580
'A chance'?

243
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,630
We didn't even have a chance.

244
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,460
One hour.

245
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,260
If she had arrived an hour earlier,
we could have saved her.

246
00:20:50,510 --> 00:21:00,640
If I had one more hour,
I could have saved Min Hee.

247
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,150
When the asystole occurred...

248
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,180
it felt like my heart would stop.

249
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,520
I couldn't do anything.

250
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,920
I don't think I'll be able to
forget Min Hee's face until I die.

251
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,540
No, Min Hee...

252
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,740
What do I do now?

253
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,870
What will I do if I remember Min Hee's face
every time I hold a scalpel?

254
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,670
Yes, Professor.

255
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,370
I told you to come in three minutes,
and eight minutes have passed already.

256
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,380
I'm sorry.

257
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,710
Eight year old girl with appendicitis,
with a possibility of perforation.

258
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,740
Study the patient,
and get ready to perform the surgery.

259
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,530
I can't perform the surgery
because of the suspension, so you do it.

260
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,690
I'll just watch.

261
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,190
You really have to do this?

262
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,640
I understand that
you want me to get stronger.

263
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,650
But, I'm not happy about
your one-dimensional training method.

264
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:08,740
Whether it's one-dimensional or not...
it's true that you are weak.

265
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,460
Are you going to do it, or not?

266
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,350
I won't penalize you if you don't do it.
Just tell me.

267
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,250
Are you going to kill the patient
wasting time like this?

268
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,090
Fine.

269
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,420
I'll ask the manager to do it.

270
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,330
I'll do it!

271
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,210
I'll be performing the surgery.

272
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,040
Prepare the 10mm scope
and the 5mm set.

273
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,820
You?

274
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,940
Woo Il Kyu, put up the results of the
lab tests and sonogram.

275
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Understood.

276
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,000
You can start.

277
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,430
Scalpel.

278
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,530
Hold it.

279
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,200
5mm trocar.

280
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,130
<i>Do you know where Park Shi On
is right now?</i>

281
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,720
He's kneeling down in front of the
morgue.

282
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,970
It's completely incomprehensible.

283
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,090
With his mentality, this can't go on.

284
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,650
And the patients' guardians
are all aware of that.

285
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,440
I see there are a lot more complaints
from the guardians than I thought.

286
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,430
Yes, I've already sent them
to the Foundation's board, too.

287
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,590
You should have given me
a heads up.

288
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,270
I didn't think of that.

289
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,320
I apologize.

290
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,050
We wasted our time unnecessarily.

291
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,570
This takes care of everything.

292
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:02,830
You think you can get rid of the director
and Park Shi On with this?

293
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,340
Of course.

294
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,190
I'm sure of it.

295
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,890
You came this far to have
lunch with me?

296
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,600
It's food for the hospital staff.
It's been awhile since I've checked it out.

297
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,910
The restaurant's been well managed
since the previous chairman.

298
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,460
Director...

299
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,570
Yes?

300
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,810
The board has received guardians' complaints
against Dr. Park Shi On.

301
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,360
Pardon?

302
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,660
The main complaint is that
Dr. Park is not fit to be a doctor.

303
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:49,150
If they want to complain, they
should do it directly to the hospital...

304
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,140
- Why the board?
- You don't get it?

305
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,090
Somebody's manipulating this.

306
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,800
What guardian would think to file
a complaint to the board?

307
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,840
I'm sorry for making this
difficult for you.

308
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,690
Lower it.

309
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,040
There's not much synechia,
and the appendix base is visible.

310
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,570
You can take care of it easily.

311
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,010
It's not even a difficult case,
what's taking so long?

312
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,040
It's almost finished.

313
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,400
Suction.

314
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,370
I think the surgery went well.

315
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,050
- Close him up.
- Okay.

316
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,700
Even if there's an emergency,
you shouldn't go into another surgery.

317
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,330
Just talk to the professor.

318
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm fine.

319
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,880
Is Park Shi On still there?

320
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,300
I think so.

321
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,070
Eat.

322
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,470
Yes, Nurse Kim.

323
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,810
Yes.

324
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,970
I'll be right there.

325
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,480
Excuse me.

326
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,130
Yes?

327
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm sorry,
but can I ask you for a favor?

328
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,930
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

329
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>A doctor in our department
hasn't eaten anything all day.</i>

330
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,650
What's that money for?

331
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,510
You don't need to go.

332
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:07,150
I don't know about anywhere else,
but it's the funeral parlor in our hospital.

333
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,400
It's enough that you expressed sorrow
after the surgery.

334
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,620
That was me as a doctor,
and this is personal.

335
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,710
Since when were you good at
distinguishing work and personal life?

336
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,390
Don't go to the funeral.

337
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,720
I'm going.

338
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,510
Don't go.

339
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,780
This is an order.

340
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,060
If you even go near the funeral parlor...

341
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,230
I'll remove you from all surgeries
for the next month.

342
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
Professor Kim Do Han.

343
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,650
Hello.

344
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,870
I heard you went through
a lot today.

345
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,520
I'm fine.

346
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,930
You don't look fine.
You should rest.

347
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,380
I didn't want to bother Mr. Choi,
so I just took a cab in.

348
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,200
I'm sorry.

349
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,890
No, we can go another time.

350
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,830
But, about Dr. Cha...

351
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,120
She's gotten very pretty.

352
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,960
She used to be so nerdy.

353
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,840
She went through a lot today,
why were you yelling at her?

354
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,550
If she did something wrong,
she should get yelled at.

355
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,880
I envy her.

356
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,560
You never yell at me like that.
You never even raise your voice.

357
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,150
You don't do anything
for me to get mad.

358
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,460
No, I do.

359
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,500
Maybe you just didn't notice.

360
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,590
Punishing someone means that
you care about that person.

361
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,720
But, if you want Dr. Cha to grow, it will
be better for you to be a little indifferent.

362
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,750
Relying on someone will
become a habit.

363
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,080
I did experience something
like heaven once.

364
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,050
Really?

365
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,790
A long time ago,
when I was about to die in the ER...

366
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,460
At that moment, all my pain stopped,
and I felt at ease.

367
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:31,170
I saw a white light, and
I kind of saw an angels' wings.

368
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,500
You saw an angel?

369
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,730
But, I found out later that
it was because of the medication.

370
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,690
They must have given me
a lot of pain killer.

371
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,040
We are not kids...
Why would we believe in such a thing?

372
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,570
Santa Claus and heaven are the same.

373
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,740
People say they exist,
but they really don't.

374
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,630
What do you mean there's no heaven?

375
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,030
Heaven exists!

376
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,420
It does!

377
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,460
Ye Eun...

378
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,000
Why did you have to hear that?

379
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,080
Please sit.

380
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:13,520
Representing the pediatrics department,
we convey our sincere condolences.

381
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:23,990
We apologize for not being able to
comfort you after the surgery.

382
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:29,980
No, we weren't in our right mind, either.

383
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,680
Please tell that female doctor
that we are sorry.

384
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,390
We treated her wrong.

385
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,880
I will.

386
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:49,710
Until before, we resented that doctor.

387
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,280
We thought she just let
our Min Hee die.

388
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,780
But...

389
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,900
we were mistaken.

390
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,630
We believe that she did her best.

391
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,920
That she was hurt,
just as much as we were.

392
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,600
We know that now.

393
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,530
And...

394
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:27,140
Please tell that male doctor, too,
that we are grateful.

395
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:36,820
He stayed there, so that
our Min Hee wouldn't be alone.

396
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,880
May I help you?

397
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,320
What brings you here?

398
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,460
This.

399
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,380
I had something urgent come up,
so I couldn't bring up the food before.

400
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,370
I felt bad, so I wanted to
give him this.

401
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,620
Thank you.
I will give it to him.

402
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,240
Yes, please do that.

403
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,740
Okay.

404
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:48,890
But, how did you know that
we work in this department?

405
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,280
I don't think I told you before.

406
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,840
I just found out.

407
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,680
I'll be going then.

408
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,280
Doctor...

409
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,950
Yes?

410
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,900
You seem like a warm person.

411
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,860
Worrying about someone else...

412
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,010
No, not really...

413
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,230
Wow, it's potato soup.

414
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,360
It's something I used to eat
in my hometown.

415
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,020
It's very delicious.

416
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,740
But... I didn't see this on the menu.

417
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,340
I think the lady made that
especially for you.

418
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,500
Wow...

419
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,900
It's so good.

420
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,740
It's the same.

421
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,670
It tastes the same as
the one I used to eat as a child.

422
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,230
Do you want some?

423
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,260
No, thanks.
You eat it all.

424
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,530
Thank you.

425
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,490
Min Hee's parents
said they were grateful to you.

426
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,820
For staying by Min Hee.

427
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,890
If something like this happens again,
you're going to do the same thing?

428
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Yes.

429
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,960
Even if the professor and I yell at you?

430
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,320
Yes.

431
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,780
A long time ago,
my brother said to me...

432
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,240
that no matter how scared I get,
I have to do what I really want to do.

433
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,830
That the one who endures it until the end,
is the greatest person in the world.

434
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,190
I'm scared of the world and
the people, too.

435
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,270
I'm scared of everything.

436
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,230
But, whenever I think about
my brother's words...

437
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,160
I feel stronger.

438
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,900
I really missed this in America.

439
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,200
- Let's eat.
- Enjoy.

440
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,910
But, I heard that the rookie has
a petition filed against him.

441
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,200
How did you find that out?

442
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,800
The manager of the pediatrics department and
the executive director did that behind my back.

443
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,260
They are so shallow.

444
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,750
But, do you think he's really
worth it?

445
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,390
Yes, we'll have a lot of use for him.

446
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,250
I have faith in your decision.

447
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,640
I'll take care of the petition
sent to the board.

448
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,280
No, let it be.

449
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,350
Within a day or two,
something good will happen.

450
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,200
When that happens, they will
naturally forget about the petition.

451
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,440
- May I ask what that is?
- You'll see.

452
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,750
It'll help you out, so don't worry.

453
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,140
Ma'am! Can I get
some pork sausage to go?

454
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,650
There's nothing to eat at the hotel.

455
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,400
This place is really good.

456
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,960
Hello.

457
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,150
Yes, I have to organize something.

458
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,710
You're a true resident.

459
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,810
I hope you'll be able to
lead a normal resident life, soon.

460
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,810
Hi, my lady!

461
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,530
You can't sleep?

462
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,440
Ye Eun!

463
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,200
Ye Eun!

464
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,510
My daddy...

465
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:45,000
When I was one,
he had a liver transplant for me.

466
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:51,560
Because I had... biliary atresia.

467
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,090
Yeah, I know that.

468
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:01,620
He worked so hard for me
and my mom...

469
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:06,370
And he died of liver cancer.

470
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,830
Why are you telling me that
story again?

471
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,320
Because I heard there's no heaven.

472
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,870
Who said that?

473
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,960
In Hye did.

474
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,510
Why is she saying useless things...

475
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,450
My poor daddy...

476
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,890
If there's no heaven,
then where is he?

477
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,670
No.

478
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,050
There is a heaven.

479
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,230
I mean it.

480
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,520
No.

481
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,960
I know In Hye is right.

482
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,650
It doesn't exist, just like Santa Claus.

483
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,570
Ye Eun.

484
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,980
Do you remember your dad's face?

485
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,340
Yes, I remember.

486
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,310
What about playing with your dad?
And receiving gifts from him?

487
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,530
Yes.

488
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,560
That's good.

489
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,340
You have the door for your father
to enter into heaven.

490
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,920
A door?

491
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,180
Yes.

492
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,210
A door.

493
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:26,350
But, if you cry everyday,
and say that there's no heaven...

494
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,530
the door will disappear.

495
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,210
But, if you only remember the good times
you had with your dad, and keep smiling...

496
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,880
a big door will appear.

497
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:46,070
Your dad goes to heaven through that door,
and sometimes comes to visit you, too.

498
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,260
My bunny and my brother
do that, too.

499
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,600
This reminds me of a song....

500
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,190
'Knock, knock,
knocking on heaven's door...'

501
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:08,950
People who say that there's no heaven,
say that because they don't have that door.

502
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,030
Thinking about it like that...

503
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,910
I feel happy all of a sudden!

504
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,450
I feel good, too.

505
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,440
Daddy!

506
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,450
You have to come visit me everyday.

507
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,470
Me, too.

508
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,890
I'm going to knock on the door for
my bunny and my brother.

509
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,970
Then, me too.
At my mom...

510
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,870
Mom, did you eat?

511
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:58,990
<i>I will ask my bunny and my brother...</i>

512
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,690
<i>to play with you.</i>

513
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:06,100
<i>They'll play with you,
so that you don't get bored.</i>

514
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,390
<i>Don't stop</i>

515
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,340
<i>When even taking one step becomes difficult</i>

516
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,740
<i>Because I know the weight of taking that step</i>

517
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,390
<i>To my friend</i>

518
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,320
<i>To my love</i>

519
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,670
<i>Trust me, two steps</i>

520
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:51,050
<i>I can't block the wind for you</i>

521
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:56,010
<i>But I can walk with you</i>

522
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,620
<i>To my friend</i>

523
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,750
<i>To my love</i>

524
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,410
<i>Trust me</i>

525
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,670
<i>The director once told me...</i>

526
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,910
<i>'Curing patients is important...</i>

527
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:19,280
<i>but giving a patient a chance to live
is just as important.'</i>

528
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:29,350
<i>Whatever it is, nothing can replace you...</i>

529
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,290
<i>Where are you?</i>

530
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,010
I'm home.

531
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:39,280
<i>Why aren't you sleeping?</i>

532
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,330
I'm preparing my thesis.

533
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,440
Come out.

534
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,240
No, I have to continue
what I was doing.

535
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,510
I'm in front of your house.
Come out.

536
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,450
You're still unhappy with me?

537
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,210
No.

538
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,210
I'm unhappy with myself.

539
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:09,160
For over ten years,
I've been so busy...

540
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,840
I forgot all about it,
but I remembered today.

541
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm not a doctor treating sick kids...

542
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,560
I'm merely a technician.

543
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,020
I invested my life into working
at a hospital, not a factory.

544
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:34,350
Giving a chance for children to live...
Giving them a future...

545
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,070
I think that's the job of a
pediatric surgeon.

546
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,860
The surgeons who are wrapped up in
those ideals fall easily.

547
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,130
I've seen them with my own eyes.

548
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,580
They didn't fall because they had ideals,
it's because of their fear.

549
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,460
Fear that they may not be able
to live up to their ideals...

550
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,970
That fear is what made
the surgeon weak.

551
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,130
I won't be like that.

552
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,780
You're acting like Park Shi On.

553
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,700
Hasty sense of responsibility, blurs
a surgeon's decision-making ability.

554
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,480
And that leads directly to mistakes.

555
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,010
I don't think Park Shi On is acting that way
out of some unfounded sense of responsibility.

556
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,750
<i>I thought that in the beginning, too.</i>

557
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,260
<i>But, Shi On is not a robot.</i>

558
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:36,000
Please help Park Shi On to
remain in the pediatrics department.

559
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,970
Whether he remains there or not
is not up to me.

560
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,030
You have the power.

561
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,380
Further neglect is like violence.

562
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,560
I can't just watch.

563
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,860
You want to give more despair
to Park Shi On?

564
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,750
Don't be protective of him anymore.

565
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,660
That's giving him unfounded hope.

566
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,900
No matter what you do,
nothing will change.

567
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,690
The result will be the same.

568
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,060
Why aren't you asleep?

569
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,210
I can't sleep.

570
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,790
I counted 1,785 dragonflies,
but I still can't sleep.

571
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:43,190
Can I come in for awhile?

572
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,510
Wow, it's been a long time
since I've been here.

573
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,420
You drew all this?

574
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,090
Yes.

575
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,580
You draw so well.

576
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,760
This is Min Hee?

577
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,030
Yes.

578
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,630
And this is heaven?

579
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,340
No.

580
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,420
Here.

581
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,750
This is it.

582
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,810
What's that?

583
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,820
Well...

584
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,370
'Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door.'

585
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,420
I mean...

586
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,260
You don't need to explain.

587
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,470
I think I understand.

588
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,800
I knew you were smart.

589
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:13,450
<i>Holding it in doesn't mean you're strong</i>

590
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,010
Thank you, Park Shi On.

591
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:27,800
Thanks to you,
I'll no longer just be a technician.

592
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:38,440
If you have a guest over,
you should bring something out.

593
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,870
Hurry.

594
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,560
Okay.

595
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,030
Can I ask you something?

596
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,560
Yes.

597
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,910
How did your brother die?

598
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:18,070
When he was young,
he went inside a mine...

599
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,860
and it collapsed.

600
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,480
I was the only one
who survived it.

601
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,120
I see.

602
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,720
My brother died because of me.

603
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,270
Because I was scared,
he went in with me.

604
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:45,870
And... it collapsed.

605
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,900
That's the thing I threw out
by accident.

606
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,050
My brother bought this for me on
my birthday before he went to heaven.

607
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:09,590
He told me to become a doctor.

608
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,730
He saved up his allowance
to buy me a toy hospital set.

609
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,570
I need to keep the promise
I made to my brother.

610
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,900
I need to become a doctor.

611
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,630
Yes.

612
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,730
No matter what happens,
you have to keep that promise.

613
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,140
Dr. Park Shi On!

614
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,250
I rang the bell so many times,
and you are still sleeping?

615
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,700
Hey!

616
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,340
I saw everything before.
Why are you covering up now?

617
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,460
I have to hurry, and go to work.

618
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,180
Today is Sunday.

619
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,840
You never went out to have fun
after coming to Seoul, right?

620
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,960
Is there anywhere you want to go?

621
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,760
Should we go watch a movie?

622
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,720
Or... should we
go eat something good?

623
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,730
PC room?

624
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,710
I'll count to five.

625
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,900
One.

626
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,110
Two.

627
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,640
Three.

628
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,770
Four.

629
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,890
I want to go there.

630
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:22,860
We're already here.

631
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,850
Let's have a good time.

632
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,910
White tiger.

633
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,550
You don't get to see this often,
so enjoy yourself.

634
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,800
Okay.

635
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,230
It's that amusing?

636
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,780
I'm sorry.

637
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:10,540
Hey, Park Shi On!

638
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,030
How many rounds are you making?

639
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,600
You like animals that much?

640
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:26,300
Yes.

641
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,370
Why do you like them?

642
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:33,370
Animals are like children,
and children are like animals.

643
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,460
They are both cute and nice.
They play together nicely.

644
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,610
You're right.

645
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:44,830
And they are both hard to handle.

646
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,670
They must be hot.

647
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,960
They won't even eat.
They are just drooping around.

648
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,510
Hey!
Where are you going now?

649
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,560
It was acute enteritis.

650
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,380
It would have been bad
if the two of you didn't discover it.

651
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,830
I gave him antibiotics,
so he should be fine.

652
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,380
I guess it's bad for both kids and animals
to be drooping around.

653
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,550
That's right.

654
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:38,050
The two of you must be veterinarians.

655
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:42,010
No, we are pediatricians.

656
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:45,100
Oh, really?

657
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:51,950
Here.

658
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,860
Thank you.

659
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,570
You're so funny.

660
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,060
Are you a vet?
Examining animals?

661
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,920
When I was an intern..

662
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,690
I didn't have many chances to see how
small a child's organs are...

663
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,080
or how hard it is to operate on them.

664
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:13,900
So, I went to a town vet, and
observed the surgeries every weekend.

665
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,660
I imagined that the animals
were children.

666
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,590
Then, you learned veterinary skills
on your own, too.

667
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:28,000
You don't want to become a vet,
instead of a doctor?

668
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,350
I do, but we are both stupid.

669
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,910
Stupid?

670
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:42,930
Animals are stupid.
At least, I should be the smart one.

671
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:45,000
But, I'm not.

672
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,570
I know you have a special fondness
for the pediatrics department...

673
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:07,710
but, it will be impossible to
fund them further.

674
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:11,640
We can't just look at the pediatrics department
for profit building purposes...

675
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:17,070
Then, why don't you use your own money
to build a children's hospital?

676
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:18,900
What?

677
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,630
Please watch your attitude.

678
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,150
This is a formal place.

679
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,300
I must have made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

680
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,060
What is it?

681
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:58,110
<i>Within the next day or two,
something good will happen.</i>

682
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:02,190
When that happens,
they will naturally forget about the petition.

683
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,120
<i>Based on the above statement...</i>

684
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:20,080
<i>Woo Myung Group will no longer support
Sung Won University Hospital with financial funding.</i>

685
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,180
- Doctor...
- What happened?

686
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,460
It's a ten year old girl.
She's no joke.

687
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,160
What do you mean?
What happened to your hand?

688
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:45,290
Is there a dog inside?

689
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:48,840
What's going on?

690
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,320
There's a big ruckus going on
in the ER!

691
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,800
There's always something
going on in the ER.

692
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,960
It's not like that.

693
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,260
Doctor!

694
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,470
Dr. Park.

695
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:44,938
<i>I can't express my love to you with words</i>

696
01:03:44,938 --> 01:03:48,575
<i>Even if you add all of the world</i>

697
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:52,746
<i>It's not enough...</i>

698
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,890
I want to be the doctor
in charge of Eun Ok.

699
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:58,610
But, you don't even try to
communicate with people.

700
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,130
Can't you just be proud of me
for once?

701
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,720
You have to keep a clear head,
do you understand?

702
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,890
If you have a girlfriend,
share it with her.

703
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,920
- Why do you keep hiccuping around me?
- That happened to my brother because of me.

704
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,150
An illness in the heart can't be
cured by a book.

705
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,860
Are you okay?
