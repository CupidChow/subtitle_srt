<i>Episode 15</i>

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,390
What I did today has nothing to do
with my feelings for you.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,290
I just wanted to console you.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,290
With all my heart.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,190
I thought you would feel uneasy.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,540
That's why I've been staying
away from you.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,750
But today...

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,770
I couldn't do that.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,240
Don't be too hurt.

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,820
What happened to Dong Jin
is not your fault.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,390
Don't do this anymore.

13
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,480
I'm upset and going through a lot.
Why are you doing this to me?

14
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,120
Hey!

15
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,690
Why...

16
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,500
Why are you doing this
so suddenly?

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,990
Suddenly what?

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,440
Why are you doing this?

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
I'm trying to comfort you.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,180
I know...

21
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,860
I know you want to comfort me.

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,910
When you were trying to comfort me,
you hugged me.

23
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,940
When I was upset about my brother,
you hugged me.

24
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,060
And when you were telling me to
be strong, you hugged me.

25
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,100
That's why I...

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,650
Is that all you meant by it?

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,830
Really?

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,050
Really.

29
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,040
You're not cold?

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,470
Just a little bit.

31
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,060
Should we go in then?

32
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,150
No, I like walking with you.

33
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,680
It reminds me of how I used to
take a walk with daddy everyday.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,530
You must be missing your dad.

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,660
Should I get you something
warm to drink?

36
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,790
Yes.

37
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,190
Stay on the bench.

38
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,190
I'll be right back.

39
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,260
You're too loud.

40
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,730
I think it's going to rain.

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,990
It's a clear night.

42
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,200
The moon looks like a pizza pie.

43
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,550
If you look at it closely, it looks
like cheese pizza without any toppings.

44
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,610
I'm sorry I got mad
about Dong Jin.

45
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,500
I'm okay.

46
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,080
Don't do that anymore.

47
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,780
Okay.

48
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,770
Shi On...

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,230
About us...

50
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,960
Can we be comfortable around
each other like we used to be?

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,680
I'll do that.

52
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,510
Since I was young, people
would be uncomfortable around me.

53
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,670
I knew at a young age what it felt
like to make someone uncomfortable.

54
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,820
I know very very well that
you are uncomfortable around me.

55
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,030
And I hate that very much.

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,580
I'm not uncomfortable around you.

57
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,270
I just want to be happy with you.

58
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,420
It might be selfish of me.

59
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,010
Asking you to go back to the way we used
to be when I know how you feel about me...

60
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,400
If you feel uncomfortable,
you don't have to do that.

61
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,690
No, I won't do that.

62
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,030
I won't whine like a child
that I like you.

63
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,550
After some time, my heart
will mature.

64
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,660
Wouldn't it be difficult to
pass through that time?

65
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,830
It won't be hard at all.

66
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,360
I want to continue to eat good food with
you, and drink with you, too.

67
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,540
I would be upset
if I couldn't do that anymore.

68
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,500
Thank you, Shi On.

69
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,920
But, before...

70
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,690
Yes?

71
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,990
Never mind.

72
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,660
Yes.

73
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,710
Excuse me?

74
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,330
What happened?

75
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,100
She was seriously injured by a
random stranger at a park.

76
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,630
She's bleeding too much.
Prepare the blood transfusion.

77
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,630
There seems to be heavy bleeding
around the liver.

78
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,920
There must be more injury than
just wounds to the ileum and pancreas.

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,990
Her guardian?

80
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,070
Fortunately, she has a minor wound,
and she's being treated.

81
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,760
Young Seo!

82
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,410
Take a CT scan,
and arrange for an operating room.

83
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,620
Please...

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,270
Please, Young Seo.

85
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,070
How can someone injure
such a young girl...

86
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,010
Professor Kim.

87
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,190
I heard on the way over.
Move her to the operating room.

88
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,870
There's damage to the liver
and internal organs.

89
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,340
She suffers from hemoperitoneum and an
infection near duodenum, and peritonitis.

90
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,230
First, find the source of bleeding.
Then, stitch up the duodenum area.

91
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,310
Yes, sir.

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,060
Over here.

93
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,400
We'll finish up.
Shears.

94
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,780
Scissors.

95
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,900
Thank you.

96
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,530
Thank you.

97
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,650
Thank you so much.

98
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,180
Don't worry too much.

99
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,720
You should get some rest, too.

100
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,940
Were you able to catch the guy?

101
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,020
He fled the scene immediately
after committing the crime.

102
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,010
<i>Her father was a firefighter.</i>

103
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,790
<i>He died two years ago.</i>

104
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,130
<i>On the job site.</i>

105
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,560
<i>The only surviving family member
I have...</i>

106
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,060
<i>is my Young Seo.</i>

107
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,240
How could a human being do this?

108
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,220
He's a psycho.

109
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,660
Even if he's a psycho,
how could he do that?

110
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,020
Remember we had another child earlier
this year from a random act of violence?

111
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,090
He hit the girl's head with a rock, right?

112
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,300
- Are there other victims?
- A total of six adults.

113
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,520
Luckily, all of their injuries are minor.

114
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,090
How could he do that?
He must get caught and be punished!

115
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,950
That's not enough.
They should do the same thing back to him.

116
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,240
You worked hard.

117
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,730
No, you are the one who
worked hard.

118
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,710
Dr. Han and Dr. Park,
attend to Young Seo.

119
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,090
You'll have to check on her often.
Dr. Cha, keep an eye on her, too.

120
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,930
Are you going to walk me out again?

121
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes.

122
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,090
You're straight forward now.

123
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't want to have to go
buy another hammer.

124
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,520
Tae Yang Hardware store is
three bus stops away.

125
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,710
It's too far.

126
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,020
Don't feel burdened.

127
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,520
This world is a dangerous place.

128
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,070
I am stronger, so I need to
protect you.

129
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,960
I know...

130
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,170
I guess the world really is a
dangerous place.

131
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,270
But, are you sure you're strong?

132
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,970
I'm stronger than I appear to be.
I can break an apple in half.

133
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,010
And I can open a tuna can
in one shot.

134
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,620
You must be a regular muscle man...

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,050
Oh, right!

136
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,230
I want to go eat something
delicious tomorrow.

137
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,840
I will buy.

138
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,910
Really?

139
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,960
Yes.

140
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,870
Think about what you want to eat.

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,990
Okay.

142
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,080
I'll be going then.
You should go in.

143
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,150
Get home safely.

144
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,100
Okay.

145
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,640
<i>This is good enough for me.</i>

146
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,120
<i>Looking at your smiling face...</i>

147
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,100
<i>Staying by your side at all times...</i>

148
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>This is good enough for me.</i>

149
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,780
<i>I think I've matured a lot
in the past couple of days.</i>

150
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,340
Why aren't you sleeping?

151
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,290
I'm sorry, In Hye.

152
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,440
No.

153
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,520
I know you were thinking about me.
I'm sorry for getting angry.

154
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,810
No.

155
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,500
You had every right to be mad.

156
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,630
I'm not mad because you kept
In Young's job a secret from me.

157
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,260
I'm mad because now even if I die,
you and In Young will never work out.

158
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,330
What do you mean?

159
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:21,930
Before, there was hope if you said
you liked In Young.

160
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,900
But now, there's no hope.

161
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:29,740
A doctor like you wouldn't date
someone who works at a place like that.

162
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,290
In Hye.

163
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,370
Even if you say that you don't like her,
I have nothing to say.

164
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,900
I was shocked, too.

165
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,200
But...

166
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:47,820
I could tell how much In Young
loves you and cares for you.

167
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,890
For a sister that she loves,
she's taking on that harsh job.

168
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,230
Even if she's your family...

169
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,990
That's not something easy to do.

170
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,830
You'll know when you become
an adult, too.

171
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,140
I'm a bit strange...

172
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,260
I trust in the things I can't see
more than the things I can see.

173
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,370
The most precious things in this world
are invisible to our eyes.

174
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,980
You think I'm a cow?

175
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,060
You give me porridge everyday!

176
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,540
Get me rice!

177
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,320
No, you have to continue this diet.

178
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,590
Who says?

179
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,650
If you have phone numbers for
nearby restaurants, get it to me!

180
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,870
No.

181
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,300
Hey!

182
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,100
Why are you going away?

183
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,060
Okay...

184
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,370
Shi On...

185
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,880
You should go out, and buy me
a bowl of blood sausage stew.

186
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,640
Right now!

187
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,260
No.

188
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,910
If you eat anything other than porridge,
it'll put too much strain on your throat.

189
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,660
This dumb kid...

190
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,070
What do you know?

191
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,430
I know a lot.

192
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm a doctor.

193
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,640
Follow your doctor's orders.

194
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,450
You must follow the orders!

195
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,860
That kid...

196
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,140
Why didn't you tell me?

197
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,470
That Chairman Jung is the one
who caused my father to die?

198
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,460
Who told you?

199
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,170
Is that what's important?

200
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,590
Back then, you were very sensitive.

201
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,430
I didn't want you to get more hurt.

202
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,300
Your father didn't want me to
say anything, either.

203
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,100
Then, you should have told me later.

204
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,170
Do you think saying sorry
will solve anything?

206
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,850
Why do you always make me
into the bad guy?

207
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,510
Professor Kim.

208
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
What is it?

209
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,750
The Academy for Pediatric Surgery
sent the director a file.

210
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,980
But the director asked that it be
forwarded to you.

211
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,010
The Boston Children's Hospital
asked our faculty for advice.

212
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,240
They are inquiring about a surgical method
for one of their patients.

213
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,880
- This is hydrocephalus.
- Right.

214
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,460
He was an 11 year old
baseball player.

215
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,930
He got a head injury
while training.

216
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,930
And that's how he got
the hydrocephalus.

217
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,790
They should insert VP Shunt through
the abdominal cavity.

218
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,630
That doesn't seem to be an option.

219
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,660
They had ten surgeries, and there's
a problem with his abdominal cavity.

220
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,830
They are inquiring whether there's
another procedure other than the VP Shunt.

221
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,800
There's no other way.

222
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,280
Oh, right!

223
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,430
This child patient is Korean.

224
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,120
A Korean?

225
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,510
He was getting treated at the
Tae Hang Hospital before getting transferred.

226
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,570
Dr. Park.

227
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,020
Do you know what this is?

228
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes, I do.

229
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,700
What are your thoughts?

230
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,410
I agree that there's no other procedure
other than the VP Shunt, but...

231
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,420
But...

232
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,660
But nothing.
That's it.

233
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,250
I don't think there's any solution.

234
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,100
Give them our feedback.

235
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,120
You want to end things now?

236
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,180
Please relay my message to
Chairman Jung.

237
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,940
I will pay him back
for playing around with me.

238
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,850
Paying someone back isn't something
that the weak can do to the strong.

239
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,720
That's only possible between two
strong opponents.

240
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,180
So, it doesn't pertain to you
or to the foundation.

241
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,460
Wasn't your goal to push the chairman
out of her seat, and take that position?

242
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,980
My goal has changed.

243
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,040
To protect the foundation that
my father started.

244
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,010
It was Chairman Jung's kind consideration
to place you in the chairwoman's position.

245
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,470
As a means to apologize for the past.

246
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:06,010
I don't need his apology or
his consideration.

247
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,180
Will it be a while before she
is moved to a room?

248
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,980
She'll be here soon.

249
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,080
It took her a while to recover.

250
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,660
I think she will be very frightened
when she wakes up.

251
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,250
I'm worried.

252
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,070
This bastard!

253
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,220
How can he use a knife on a child?

254
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,000
If I ever get him...

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll finish him off!

256
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,880
You would be the first to run away
if he ever came into view.

257
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,160
Right?

258
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,000
What am I talking about...

259
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,060
Isn't that her?

260
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,550
Young Seo.

261
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,910
There's nobody who saw the
criminal's face.

262
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,580
So, we were wondering if the
child saw his face.

263
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,490
Can you come back later?

264
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm sorry, but we need to catch him
quickly to avoid further crimes.

265
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,480
Young Seo's not stable yet.

266
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,300
It will be too hard on her.

267
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,680
Please...

268
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,300
Could you cooperate for a moment?

269
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,530
Young Seo...

270
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,370
Do you remember what the
bad guy looked like?

271
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,550
No, not my Young Seo.

272
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,070
No!

273
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,710
Young Seo.

274
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,990
Young Seo.

275
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,240
Young Seo.

276
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,530
Young Seo.

277
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,120
She's in a state of shock.

278
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,790
That'll be enough for today.

279
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,280
People don't know.

280
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,090
What it feels like when you are
traumatized as a child.

281
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,420
Inside your head, you get a wound
as big as a sports arena.

282
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,390
It doesn't go away easily.

283
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:54,410
The more you try to stop thinking about it,
the more the wound hurts.

284
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,510
Everyday.

285
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:02,700
If you know what that wound feels like,
you must know what it is that Young Seo needs.

286
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,750
Yes.

287
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,940
We need to let her know that there
is a strong person by her side.

288
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,230
A strong person?

289
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,150
There's someone who scared her.

290
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,320
But she needs to know that there is someone
stronger and kinder by her side.

291
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,220
For me, my brother was that person...
And you, too.

292
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,750
What are you guys doing?

293
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,710
Can't you tell?

294
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,700
We are hitting the sandbag.

295
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,950
Why?

296
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,670
If we hit this a lot,
we'll get good at fighting.

297
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,000
Fighting is bad.
You shouldn't fight!

298
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,380
Even if I don't want to fight,
what can I do if other kids attack?

299
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,920
- I can't just get beaten up.
- You should try it, too.

300
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,260
It's so much fun.

301
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,590
Hit it!

302
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,050
Not like that.

303
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,250
Straighten out your arm.
Like this.

304
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,990
Just like that.

305
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,690
In Hye.

306
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,330
Let's talk.

307
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,070
I know...

308
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,460
I'm not doing this
because you did something wrong.

310
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,430
You didn't do anything wrong.

311
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,130
I'm angry and upset that
I'm nothing more than a burden to you.

312
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,660
You are my one and only sister.

313
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,400
You're not a burden.

314
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,300
I want to be discharged tomorrow.

315
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,400
In Hye.

316
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,730
Since yesterday, I feel like
I'm laying on top of a thorn bush.

317
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,670
I don't like the hospital.

318
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,470
I don't work there anymore.

319
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,300
I quit that job.

320
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,240
Let's get the surgery.

321
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,830
I've saved up all the money.

322
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,180
Is your mother well?

323
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,540
Didn't you say she has
thyroid problems?

324
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,640
She's fine.

325
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,030
No other problems?

326
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,310
No.

327
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,110
What's wrong with your short answers?

328
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,350
Hello.

329
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:38,940
Why are you sitting here
without permission?

330
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,790
A first year resident
sits here and eats comfortably?

331
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,820
Yes.

332
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,150
I came because Sun Joo said
she would stay in the ER for me.

333
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,240
Manager Ko, you should come
over to my house again.

334
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,210
I ordered 20 packs of spicy beef soup
for you from the Home Shopping Network.

335
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,850
I succeeded in ordering it
before they sold out.

336
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,360
You can eat that in the mornings
after you drink.

337
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,490
Why would I go to your house?

338
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,850
You can come over, too.

339
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,230
No, thanks.

340
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,380
Just take care of the manager.

341
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,890
That's understandable.

342
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,410
I have nothing to say to Shi On.

343
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,810
He's only saying that.
I'm sure he doesn't feel that way.

344
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,590
Father and mother alike...

345
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,120
We are both useless to Shi On.

346
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,120
He'll soon see...

347
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,850
What a blessing it is that
both of you are around.

348
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:07,070
He's an adult already,
but he's maturing more and more.

349
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,400
Trust in him,
and just wait a bit more.

350
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,610
What I should have done for him
for the past 20 years...

351
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,990
you have done for him
in the past few months.

352
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:36,230
Thank you for always giving him courage,
and treating him with kindness.

353
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,930
I heard.

354
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,710
You're getting the surgery.

355
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,140
Don't worry.

356
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,830
Everything will work out.

357
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,460
Dr. Park, is life always this hard?

358
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,270
I don't know well...

359
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,740
But, I think so.

360
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,790
Even if I get the surgery,
I don't think I'll be happy at all.

361
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,260
Because of In Young?

362
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,030
In Young will be happy.

363
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,770
Very much.

364
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,640
Don't you have the night shift?

365
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,340
I asked Dr. Han to take over
just for tonight.

366
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,830
Because you want to take me
out to eat?

367
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,930
Yes.

368
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,070
Where are you taking me?

369
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,840
What are you going to treat me to?

370
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,610
Tell me.

371
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,740
It's a secret.

372
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm going to find out later.
Why keep it a secret?

373
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,520
Marinated beef?
Or...

374
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,130
Sushi rolls...
Sweet and sour pork...

375
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,300
Fish stew!
That's what I want...

376
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,740
Hey!

377
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,230
Can you only drive during the daytime?

378
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,040
Why can't you see in the dark?

379
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,160
Are you okay?

380
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,280
I'm fine.

381
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,850
Hey!

382
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,450
Seriously, what are you
going to feed me?

383
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,610
It's a secret.

384
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,320
Did you go to Italy
to buy spaghetti?

385
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,570
I'm sorry.

386
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,170
Just wait a bit.

387
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,370
I just need to boil the noodles.

388
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,310
You're making the noodles now?

389
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,250
Hey.

390
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,810
Who makes spaghetti with
thin noodles?

391
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,350
I made a mistake,
and bought the thin noodles.

392
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,190
This is some combo...

393
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,320
As long as it tastes good,
it's fine...

394
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,180
How is it?

395
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,140
Hey...

396
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,640
Try it yourself, Chef Park.

397
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,500
It tastes like cold rice mixed with
diced garlic and hot ketchup.

398
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,890
You better not tell me again
that you are cooking.

399
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
I'm sorry.

400
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,610
Let's make a deal.

401
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,620
We won't ever cook for
each other again.

402
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:33,850
That's a great idea.
I agree.

403
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,460
You are so quick to agree.

404
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,830
Bring some triangular rolls!
I'm hungry.

405
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,910
Still, good try.

406
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,870
Where were you all day?

407
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,720
You weren't at the office, either.

408
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:05,320
Just here and there...

409
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,680
I took care of Chairman Jung.

410
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,040
Good.

411
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,390
What's the use?

412
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,770
I've already handed over the files
a long time ago.

413
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,310
What do I do now?

414
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
I've never felt so lost
in my life.

415
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,570
Even when Father passed away,
I didn't feel this bad.

416
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,310
You can make things better.

417
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,270
It's not too late.

418
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,530
I...

419
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,860
I don't know what I lived for.

420
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,720
I wasn't living for myself...

421
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,400
And I wasn't living for anyone else, either.

422
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,040
I really don't know.

423
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,240
You cared for me.

424
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,710
No.

425
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,010
I did that to please myself.

426
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,110
I was only pretending to care for you.

427
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:17,790
I want to regain the good memories.

428
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,650
The memories of the time
that I really did care for you.

429
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,070
I was trying to erase the
bad memories...

430
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,820
and all the good memories
disappeared, too.

431
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,150
The memories of when we
really loved each other.

432
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,050
The happy memories...

433
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,570
It feels like everything in my head
just wiped out.

434
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:46,430
Like an empty house.

435
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,000
No, Mom.

436
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,570
I don't want to get set up for marriage.

437
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,920
No, I don't want to!

438
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,520
I don't care if he's a prosecutor!

439
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,290
I can't hear you.

440
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,980
Hello?

441
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,360
Yes?

442
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,680
Mom, I can't hear you.

443
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,670
Mom?
I can't hear you...

444
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,680
Okay.

445
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,490
Why would I get set up for marriage
at this young age?

446
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,750
How embarrassing.

447
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,340
Why don't you give it a shot?

448
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,730
He must be great if he's a prosecutor.

449
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,820
No thanks!

450
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,450
Am I supposed to be candidate
number one?

451
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,580
I want to get set up, too.

452
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,870
Really?

453
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,530
Then, should I introduce
you to someone later?

454
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,610
Yes.

455
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,560
Okay.

456
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,400
There's tons of singles around.

457
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,910
Right!

458
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,410
Do you want to see a
picture of that guy?

459
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,040
He's so funny looking.

460
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,310
Why are you laughing?

461
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,390
He looks like Lord Voldemort
from Harry Potter.

462
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,100
Then, GGB from Harry Potter?

463
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,980
I found out the truth.

464
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,400
About what?

465
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,420
The truth about GGB was
revealed at the last team dinner.

466
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,390
Nobody knows about that nickname.
You are the only one who calls yourself that.

467
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,420
Those guys...

468
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,820
I knew someone was talking about me.

469
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,960
You just sat back?

470
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,290
You should have stuck up for me.

471
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,110
I was focusing so much
on the beef...

472
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,690
Have you gone mad over beef?

473
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,020
But, how would I know?

474
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,990
You should have told them
that it's true.

475
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,340
I only saw your face.
I never saw your body.

476
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,140
So is it true or not?

477
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,810
Let's just say that it's true.

478
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,090
Dr. GGB.

479
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,380
It's okay, Young Seo.
He's a doctor.

480
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,540
I think she's scared of the stethoscope.

481
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,440
She's showing symptoms of PTSD.

482
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,920
She must think that the
stethoscope is a weapon.

483
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,320
Shouldn't she get immediate treatment?

484
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,950
She should...

485
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,870
But it will only show results
after she's fully recovered physically.

486
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,970
The physical pain after the surgery has
a big impact on the psychological fear.

487
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,480
Then, we have to leave her like that
until she's fully recovered?

488
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,910
We can start now...

489
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,110
Should we start?

490
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,760
Let her be for now...

491
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,820
We'll try to take care of her.

492
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,360
What are you guys doing here?

493
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,140
We are eating chips.

494
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,900
You want some, too?

495
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,870
Oh, right!

496
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,860
You can join our team now.
There's no conditions.

497
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,560
That's right.

498
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,440
Ye Eun, you can't eat any food
made with flour.

499
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,100
Woo Ram, you can't eat oily food.

500
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,000
And Ho Suk, you can't eat sweets.

501
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,070
We can't even eat a little bit?

502
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,080
No.

503
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,090
You have to control your food
if you want to get better.

504
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,410
I'm going to take away all these chips.

505
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,300
They'll be in the nurses' room. You
can pick it up when you leave the hospital.

506
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,530
She used it all up.

507
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,090
All gone.

508
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,480
<i>There's a man who scared her.</i>

509
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,380
But she has to know that there's someone
stronger and kinder by her side.

510
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,160
For me, my brother was that person.
And you, too.

511
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,970
Isn't that the file from Boston?

512
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,250
Yes.

513
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,920
I've been having this uneasy feeling
after emailing them back.

514
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,630
About what?

515
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,620
I feel like there may be a way.

516
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,460
I can't pinpoint it.

517
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,230
Then, keep thinking about it.

518
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,320
Okay.

519
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,600
I haven't been able to check her
since yesterday.

520
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,610
Young Seo.

521
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,470
Isn't this cute?

522
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,690
This is nothing scary.

523
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,550
Don't be scared.

524
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,610
Let's see...

525
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,940
Young Seo,
you don't need to be scared.

526
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,780
I fight really well.

527
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,120
He knows that as well.

528
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,650
That's right.

529
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,280
He's just like Won Bin from the movie,
'The Man from Nowhere'.

530
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,510
Are you laughing?

531
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,590
No.

532
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,750
You were snickering.

533
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,300
The stethoscope.

534
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,310
What about it?

535
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,820
Thank you for using it.

536
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Should I have just kept it
stashed away in the corner?

537
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,250
No. Please use it in the future, too.

538
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,930
What is it?

539
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,500
What is it?

540
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,260
It's a Pink Hotel certificate
at the On Yun Spa.

541
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,320
They say this hotel has a great spa.

542
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,230
It's great for your skin.

543
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,730
You should go.
I have no time to travel.

544
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,340
You can go later.

545
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,010
It expires at the end of the year.

546
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,420
If you have no one to go with...
I can...

547
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,470
Why would I go with you?

548
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,220
I thought you might get lonely
if you go alone.

549
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,410
Lonely...

550
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,890
Do you think that makes any sense?

551
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,190
I just meant well...

552
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:42,380
What are you saying to your boss?

553
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,260
This is sexual harassment!

554
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,280
No...

555
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,890
What are you thinking?

556
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,290
Check it.
I reserved two rooms.

557
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,640
I don't care if it's 100 rooms!
I won't let this pass.

558
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,730
I'm going to report this.

559
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,600
How annoying...

560
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,190
That's not what I meant...

561
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,570
Why?

562
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,680
Is it strange because
I don't look sick at all?

563
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,280
You must be happy.

564
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,550
Since I don't have much time
left to live.

565
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,870
Please stop saying things like that.

566
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:32,370
But, in the short amount of time I have left...
I'm going to make you suffer, too.

567
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,180
You think I'm going to die quietly?

568
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,450
It's about time that
you had a change of heart.

569
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,850
It's your last chance to be
a good father to Shi On.

570
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,800
And were you ever a good
mother to him?

571
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,690
How dare you say...

572
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,200
I'm going to beg.

573
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,730
I'm going to beg to Shi On
for the rest of my life.

574
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,700
So you should do that, too.

575
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,580
Why...

576
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,600
Why do you keep triggering me?

577
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,970
Don't hit her!

578
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,560
I don't like hitting!

579
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,120
This punk...

580
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,740
You...

581
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,100
What do you think you're doing
to your father?

582
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,440
I'm... stronger now.

583
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,610
So, don't do that.

584
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,830
Don't do that to mom, either.

585
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,300
Thank you, Shi On.

586
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,540
For protecting me.

587
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,290
How much longer are you going to
get beaten by father?

588
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,840
I was happy that I couldn't remember
you getting beat.

589
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,270
You're still getting beat.

590
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,500
Nothing has changed.

591
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,750
I'm sorry, Shi On.

592
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,160
Stop saying that you are sorry.

593
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:30,880
Why is it that the only thing you
say to me is sorry?

594
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,840
What brings you to the hospital?

595
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,330
I thought I discharged you.

596
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,660
I'm not here as the vice president,
rather as a representative for the investors.

597
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,820
I was just showing them around.

598
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,950
We are here to check over the facility.

599
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,680
They say everything is in perfect condition.

600
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,630
That's all thanks to you.

601
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:36,940
Let's go.

602
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,460
That's right!

603
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,440
Dr. Park.

604
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,940
This over here...

605
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,410
Isn't this the VP Shunt from yesterday?

606
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,420
Yes, we thought the only way was
through the abdominal cavity.

607
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,330
Yes.

608
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:13,040
But, if the abdominal cavity is the problem,
what if we have the fluid flow another way?

609
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,130
Towards the bladder or the gallbladder.

610
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,190
Think hard.

611
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,370
Due to frequent urination,
the bladder may be problematic.

612
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:46,010
But with the gallbladder, the fluid will
flow to the small intestines, so it will work.

613
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,750
Right?
You think it's possible, too?

614
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,970
Yes, I think it's...

615
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,840
It's definitely possible.

616
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,540
Yes!

617
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,110
You said you couldn't pinpoint it.

618
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,700
You must be happy now.

619
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,190
Theoretically, do you think
it makes sense?

620
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,690
Even in practice,
I think it makes sense.

621
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,300
Of course, there are risks.

622
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,200
We don't know how it will affect
other organs, and we don't know the cause.

623
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,020
Still, I think it's worth a try.

624
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,620
I agree.

625
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,870
I tried to copy Park Shi On.

626
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,570
I tried hard to picture it in my head.

627
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,950
Pretending, that it was a real surgery.

628
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,840
Another genius is born.

629
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,610
As you know, I have a great mind.

630
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,140
GGM.
God-given mind.

631
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,690
Whatever you say...

632
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,370
You should contact Boston.

633
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,460
Yes, sir.

634
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,820
<i>I'm most envious of hands that
have scars and calluses.</i>

635
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,990
<i>It means that the hand has been
through a lot of surgeries.</i>

636
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:11,890
I want to become a surgeon, and make
many scars and calluses on my hands, too.

637
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,260
I'm a surgeon, too!

638
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,300
<i>I want to say that, too.</i>

639
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,510
Il Kyu.

640
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:29,980
Bring me our department files
for all the surgeries in the past two years.

641
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,090
You have until this weekend.

642
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,520
When the rooftop is this big...

643
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,160
Is that true?
There's a way?

644
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,890
<i>Yes, the doctor just came by.</i>

645
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,280
- When can they have the surgery?
- It can be done immediately...

646
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,660
- But they recommended another hospital.
- Which one?

647
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,830
<i>Sung Won University Hospital.</i>

648
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:25,000
<i>They were the ones who informed
them of the surgical method.</i>

649
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,900
Where?

650
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:30,430
<i>They recommended
Sung Won University Hospital.</i>

651
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,720
Try it.

652
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,520
It's not too sweet,
and it has a great texture.

653
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:45,790
Are you busy?

654
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,860
Yes.

655
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,800
This is an errand from my seniors. I want
to bring this to them before it gets cold.

656
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,810
Why don't you sit for a minute?

657
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,210
They are busy.

658
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,900
They will be drinking the coffee
when it's cold anyway.

659
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,400
Professor Kim Do Han always did that.

660
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,720
Okay.

661
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,710
Then, just for a moment...

662
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,300
Did you confess your feelings to her?

663
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,060
- Yes.
- The result?

664
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,450
I don't know.

665
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,780
I guess it wasn't a total rejection.

666
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,540
Thank you, Dr. Park.

667
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,390
Excuse me?
For what?

668
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,020
I'm just thankful.

669
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,880
And I hope you'll succeed in
your love.

670
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,060
If something doesn't work out,
you can come visit me anytime.

671
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,890
Okay.

672
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,090
Thank you.

673
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,920
Try it.

674
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,240
Should I?

675
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,880
Let's share it.

676
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,230
Are you close to the general manager?

677
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:30,550
Yes, she listened to my worries.
And she bought me steak, too.

678
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,220
How did you get close to her?

679
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,490
It just happened...

680
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:39,200
Why didn't you tell me that
you got close to her?

681
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,960
I forgot.

682
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,640
What worries did you talk
to her about?

683
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,730
Just this and that about life...

684
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,460
You never talked to me about that.

685
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,040
The general manager is
very pretty, right?

686
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,430
Yes, she's very pretty.
And she's very nice.

687
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,740
Yeah, I guess she is pretty.

688
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,440
I guess you are really close to her.

689
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,610
No, not that much.

690
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,770
She's a good person.
You should stay close to her.

691
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,380
You can talk to her about
your worries, too.

692
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,480
Okay.

693
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,870
I'm going to the ward.

694
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,510
Bye.

695
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:01,490
You didn't go home yet?

696
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,000
No.

697
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,140
I heard Young Seo's blood pressure
went up.

698
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,880
Do you remember how the director
used to be a long time ago?

699
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,540
Before he became a director, he almost never
went home because he was too busy with the patients.

700
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,400
He even shared the call room
with the residents.

701
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,540
He was unique.

702
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,160
But I see that in you
these days.

703
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,250
I question myself a lot these days.

704
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,530
Am I really a good doctor?

705
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,560
Just standard questions like that...

706
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,960
That seems like a question
out of a text book.

707
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,390
I know...

708
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,520
Since one of our team members is
very much like a text book...

709
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,870
I naturally think about those things.

710
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,430
He's a big headache.

711
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,460
Doctor!

712
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,760
Mustache...

713
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,090
A scar in his eyebrow...

714
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,330
Mustache...

715
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:18,480
A scar in his eyebrow...

716
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,510
Mustache...

717
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,120
A scar...

718
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,470
Although she doesn't have a clear memory of
his appearance, we can make a note about his scar.

719
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:35,150
It will be good evidence
when we have the suspects.

720
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,290
It's clear that Young Seo remembers
the criminal's face.

721
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,050
You don't think she's in danger?

722
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:42,970
Most people who commit random
acts of violence don't come back after fleeing.

723
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,230
He won't come back to harm her
just because she knows his face.

724
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:51,690
Still, can the cops protect her?

725
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,310
That won't happen.
Don't worry.

726
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,480
What if it does happen?

727
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,330
We are the professionals.

728
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:59,880
Trust us.

729
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,920
Should we ask the guards
for their help?

730
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,070
I called before, but they'll only
be able to put someone on patrol.

731
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:17,740
They don't have enough staff.

732
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:21,240
We may be over-reacting.

733
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,720
Don't worry too much.

734
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,520
Dr. Cha, you should go home.

735
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,660
- What about you?
- I'll go after I finish something up.

736
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,270
Young Seo will be okay, right?

737
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,450
She'll be fine.

738
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,990
Who are you?

739
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,300
Young Seo.

740
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:01,970
That's him!

741
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,050
That's him!

742
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,380
Are you the one who did that
to Young Seo?

743
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:15,950
Mister, you're really a bad person.

744
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:19,340
A really really bad person.

745
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,670
Take Young Seo, and leave!

746
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:36,170
- Professor Kim.
- Park Shi On, hurry up!

747
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,920
Help!

748
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,490
Help!

749
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,490
What's wrong?

750
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,210
The criminal is here.

751
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,260
The criminal.

752
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,120
Please call the cops.

753
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,690
Call the cops!

755
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,610
Professor Kim,
hang in there!

756
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,680
Professor Kim!

757
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,990
Why are you doing this?
What do I do?

758
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,770
If you are the only one around,
what are you going to do?

759
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,960
I'll finish them off.

760
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,760
I'll crush them to death.

761
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:19,160
You are the one who will
take over the foundation...

762
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,420
I'll get it back.

763
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,230
Thank you for yesterday.

764
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:25,460
Are you a stalker?
Why are you following me?

765
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:31,060
Vice President, you are a bad man. It would
be more sad if there's no chance to live.
