1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,370
I've become quite strange
these days.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,640
I mean...

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,820
Not strange...

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,690
Something like that...

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,520
What I mean is...

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,420
It bothers me when you are
close to other women.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,140
And it bothers me when you ask me
to set you up on a blind date.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,400
That's how I feel.

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:51,240
Now, I don't want you to
lean on me anymore.

10
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,340
Now...

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,180
I...

12
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,200
I want to...

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>I can't express my love to you with words</i>

14
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,830
<i>Even if you add all of
the world, it's not enough</i>

15
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,570
<i>Until my tears dry,
until my heart wears out</i>

16
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:36,310
<i>The love that I want and long for is you</i>

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,070
My...

18
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,250
My blood vessels...

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,620
My blood vessels feel hot
like pipes inside a boiler.

20
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,099
<i> I am in love with you...</i>

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,620
Inside my heart, it feels like
someone's beating on the drums.

22
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:11,120
<i>Even if my tears dry,
even if my heart wears out</i>

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,520
<i>I am in love with you</i>

24
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,860
Then, what about me?

25
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,660
How do you think I feel?

26
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,830
I feel the same way.

27
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,390
I...

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,650
I don't understand.

29
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,850
I don't know what I should
do for you.

30
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,030
You don't need to do anything.

31
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,360
My hands are cold.

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,520
I guess it is cold out.

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,010
You should be careful
not to catch a cold.

34
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:16,180
I will be careful,
but my hands are still cold.

35
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,350
I will buy you a pair of gloves tomorrow.

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,740
You always clasp the hand
so tightly.

37
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,860
Yes.

38
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,590
Did you hold a lot of different
girls' hands?

39
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you a player?

40
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,370
No.

41
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,560
When guardians take autistic patients around,
this is how they hold their hand.

42
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:08,430
In case of impulsive acts,
they need to have a tight grip.

43
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,620
I see.

44
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,340
The director used to hold me like this
when I was young.

45
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,020
Now, I'm not the one holding you.
You're the one holding me.

46
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,850
I see.

47
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,700
- Dr. Cha.
- Yes?

48
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,810
By any chance...

49
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,450
Do you think you'll regret this
tomorrow morning?

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Regret what?

51
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:55,140
I often regret things I do and say
in the evening.

52
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,430
I regret them exactly at 6:30 AM.

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,660
Hey!

54
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,040
It's not like I was drunk.
Why would I regret anything?

55
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,840
Then...

56
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,180
can you promise me one thing?

57
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,250
If you do regret it, come to work
tomorrow with your hair tied up.

58
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,730
What's that?

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,670
I don't think I can bear to hear
it if you are regretful.

60
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,520
Please do that, so I can tell
just by looking at you.

61
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,030
Fine.

62
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,850
Then, I'll be going back
to the hospital.

63
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,750
<i>When you miss a person,
no matter how much you insist</i>

64
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>It's like trying to stop a young child</i>

65
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:17,510
<i>Everything that fills my eyes is you</i>

66
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:27,340
<i>I only look at you, who doesn't
know my heart, though it hurts</i>

67
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:35,150
<i>Wind blows in my heart,
stepping on the countless scars</i>

68
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:42,030
<i>Though I know love is painful</i>

69
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:49,790
<i>My heart beats once again,
I want to believe that our love</i>

70
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:56,740
<i>Isn't momentary, but is like destiny</i>

71
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,872
<i>My heart beats once again...</i>

72
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,340
I won't... regret it, right?

73
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,100
6:30 AM.

74
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,650
6:30...

75
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,530
Good morning.

76
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,340
You're here?

77
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,980
What?

78
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,380
It's nothing.

79
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,430
Try going outside.

80
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,310
What?

81
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,370
Do you know how windy
it is outside?

82
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,970
Walking here with all my hair down,
I looked like a crazy woman.

83
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,270
Bad wind...

84
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,060
I'll be going to the ward then.

85
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,390
Why did you want to see me?

86
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,510
I want to ask you two things.

87
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,400
Go ahead.

88
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,280
Do you think you'll be able to stick
around in this unfavorable environment?

89
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,320
I think your definition of an environment
is very different from mine.

90
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,290
No matter which department, the
most important environment is the doctor.

91
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,730
The external environment
is only secondary.

92
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,730
Let me ask you the second question.

93
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,870
Giving a future to the children...

94
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,920
Giving them happiness...

95
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,950
You don't think doctors in other nations
want those same things?

96
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,630
I'm sure they do.

97
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,860
But the difference is that they only guarantee
a future and happiness to the chosen few.

98
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,180
The future we guarantee to the children
doesn't include the words 'chosen few.'

99
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,580
Cha Yoon Seo!

100
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,410
Yes, Eun Jung.

101
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,400
Why didn't you answer my text
last night?

102
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Something came up.

103
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,180
I heard you were set up with
a prosecutor.

104
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,690
My mom called you again?

105
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,870
It's nothing new that she's asking me
about your personal life.

106
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,060
Let's just end our friendship.

107
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,760
That's what I want to say.

108
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,160
She drives me crazy with her questions.

109
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,080
Why...

110
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,970
Now that I'm dying,
you're happy?

111
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm sure you are...

112
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm not happy.

113
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,980
This kid...

114
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,880
You're such a good liar.

115
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,430
Just like your mother.

116
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,090
Honey.

117
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,580
I'm not lying.

118
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,760
Shut up, you retard!

119
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,280
Shi Duk...
My son, Shi Duk.

120
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,620
How good it would be
if our Shi Duk was around.

121
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,870
- He would have taken such good care of me.
- Why are you bringing up Shi Duk?

122
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,870
Shi Duk...

123
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,910
My damn life...

124
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,300
I hate my life...

125
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,200
<i>You...</i>

126
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,750
This is your last chance.

127
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,680
Get rid of everyone who will
get in our way.

128
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,260
I heard from the chairwoman
that you are helping her a lot.

129
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,210
I created the problem.

130
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,510
I should at least pretend to
take care of the problem.

131
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,610
Yes.

132
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,840
You should continue to do that.

133
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,770
For the chairwoman.

134
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,780
The chairwoman never wanted
anything from you.

135
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:29,280
She only thought about what would
be good for you.

136
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:38,670
I won't tell you to understand the chairwoman,
or become friendly with her.

137
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,830
But...

138
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,100
Don't avoid her.

139
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,780
If you stay around her,
there will be an opportunity to reconcile.

140
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,630
But if you avoid her,
you won't even get that opportunity.

141
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,860
Okay?

142
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,220
Okay.

143
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,530
I requested for a conference
regarding this matter.

144
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,620
I'll have a debate with Chief Kim.

145
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,870
Then, have you found the reasons
why we must operate on In Hye?

146
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,300
Just about.

147
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,090
- What is it?
- First, the blood vessel anastomosis.

148
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,560
And the small intestine fistula.

149
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,810
True, we have more experience
with small intestine fistulas.

150
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,220
We'll come to a decision tomorrow.

151
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,720
Before then, don't say anything.

152
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,930
Yes, sir.

153
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,500
- Are you eating well?
- Yes.

154
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,360
- Please check Dong Jin's temperature frequently.
- Yes, sir.

155
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,090
What are you writing down?

156
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,710
All the happy moments in my life.

157
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,300
Thinking about it now,
there were a lot of times.

158
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,260
I'm sure there are a lot of times
that you can't remember as well.

159
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,740
I hope I'll remember enough memories
to fill up this entire diary.

160
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,660
That way...

161
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,970
If something happens to me,
my sister will look at this and not be so sad.

162
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,000
In Hye, why do you keep on
saying that?

163
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,250
I know everything.

164
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,090
The small intestine transplant...

165
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,750
It's a very difficult
and dangerous surgery.

166
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,400
Even so, I wish the doctors at the
pediatrics surgery department could do it.

167
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,540
I think I'll be more at ease, then.

168
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,210
That girl...

169
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,690
Why does she keep saying such
hurtful things?

170
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,060
She must have been traumatized
when she collapsed the last time.

171
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,300
She wasn't like this before.

172
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,110
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:21,720
If we perform the surgery like In Hye
says, she won't be as scared.

174
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,340
I'm sure you feel scared, too,
with the surgery date approaching.

175
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,910
Yes.

176
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,970
A little.

177
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:43,100
More than being painful...
I think it will feel very cold.

178
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,380
The doctors' hands are warmer
than you think.

179
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,050
Please believe that.

180
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,370
There's more resistance from the hospital
than we anticipated.

181
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:34,260
We just need to get rid of
the difficult ones.

182
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,920
If we get rid of them, we need
to bring in others to replace them.

183
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,860
But they won't be as great as
the current doctors we have.

184
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,280
- How different can doctors be?
- That's not true.

185
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,290
They may not differ much in skills.

186
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,810
But there are differences
that are not noticeable to our eyes.

187
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,750
What is it you are trying to say?

188
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,940
The acquisition of
Sung Won University Hospital...

189
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,420
How about just switching it back
to getting funded by public investors?

190
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,740
What?

191
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,950
Rather than trying to put on tires
that don't fit...

192
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,860
It may be better to fill up the air
on tires that fit well.

193
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,790
Hey.

194
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,250
Kang Hyun Tae.

195
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,180
You want to take the easy way?

196
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,370
That's not it.

197
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,500
Listen carefully.

198
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,150
Kids are our hope.

199
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,100
Hope that's just a bit different.

200
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,060
Look.

201
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,270
What's this?

202
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,630
An app for anniversary dates.

203
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,230
It's a bit embarrassing to say this,
but I really wanted to do this.

204
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,700
Look here.

205
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,460
It's been one day
since we started dating.

206
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,920
You're not going to download it too?

207
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,180
I don't need that.

208
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,380
Since I've met you,
it's been...

209
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,450
Stop.

210
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm still going to use this.

211
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,590
In any case,
it's our first official day together...

212
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,560
Is there anywhere you want to go?

213
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,280
- Zoo...
- Besides a zoo or a PC room.

214
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,960
There.

215
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,740
The man is always surrounded by
animal spirits.

216
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,280
That's why they always protect you
and keep you from getting tainted.

217
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,810
No matter how much someone
tries to taint you.

218
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,450
I think that's true.

219
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,680
What about me?

220
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,170
There are two.

221
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,270
One is the spirit of alcohol.

222
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,220
Oh my God.

223
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
She's right on.

224
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,560
- What about the other?
- Spirit of fire.

225
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,180
Is that because I have
a hot temper?

226
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,730
No, the nature of fire is not to burn.
It's to give warmth.

227
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,220
Giving warmth to people, land, and air.

228
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,390
Right?

229
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,110
Then...

230
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,320
What about us together?

231
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,160
It's great.
There's nothing in the way.

232
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,270
But...

233
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,550
There's only one bridge.

234
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,720
Bridge?

235
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,060
Yes, a bridge that connects
the two of you.

236
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,970
The couples who break up and
get back together often have a lot of bridges.

237
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,640
But between the two of you,
there's only one.

238
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,740
If that bridge disappears...

239
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,370
you'll never get back together.

240
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,970
Why is she saying such nonsense?

241
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,190
We shouldn't believe in something like that.

242
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,930
You're the one who said she's good,
and took me there.

243
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,650
Maybe she's lost her touch.

244
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,950
What's that?

245
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,150
This is real.

246
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:49,290
If you can match up this cube in two minutes,
we'll give you one of these prizes.

247
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,670
This!

248
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:53,150
I really need this egg cooker.

249
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,820
- Can I do it in ten seconds?
- Excuse me?

250
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,670
You should ask for more time.
Ten seconds is not enough.

251
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,400
No.

252
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,540
And it won't be fun if I do it
with my eyes open.

253
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,740
What?

254
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,400
Count to ten.

255
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,540
Start.

256
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,840
One.

257
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,680
Two.

258
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,690
Three.

259
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,000
Four.

260
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,190
Five.

261
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,170
Six.

262
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,270
Seven.

263
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,600
Eight.

264
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,700
Nine.

265
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,920
Ten.

266
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,230
Awesome!

267
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,470
This.

268
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,120
Please give me that.

269
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,410
It's done.

270
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,540
Thank you.

271
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,810
I really needed this.

272
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,970
If you need anything else,
tell me anytime.

273
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,400
I guess you used your talent
of saving children's lives for this.

274
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,600
Sometimes, I use it for other purposes, too.

275
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,070
I used this skill in a maze contest once
at an amusement park.

276
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,900
I won a box of
spicy noodles then.

277
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,300
I'm so proud of you.

278
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,090
That's nothing.

279
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,330
Being arrogant again...

280
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,720
You know...

281
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,870
Should we just openly date?

282
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,120
And tell everyone?

283
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,850
Why?
You think I'll get teased?

284
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,090
Nobody will tease me.

285
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,370
Don't worry.

286
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,560
Still...

287
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,490
I don't know.

288
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,600
It'll be fine.

289
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,990
Then, let's take time.

290
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,720
I want to tell them later.

291
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,250
Later when?

292
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,500
You'll do great, right?

293
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,900
Please make it possible for us to
operate on our In Hye.

294
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,870
Please shut Chief Kim's mouth.

295
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm not going there to fight.

296
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,050
I'm going to have a medical discussion.

297
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,490
We understand.

298
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,900
Don't worry, and work hard.

299
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,200
Let me ask one thing.

300
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,250
How do you plan on carrying out
the enteroenterostomy?

301
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,220
We will connect the small and large intestine
by end-to-end anastomosis...

302
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,600
If you connect the small and large intestines,
you can't make an intestinal fistula.

303
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,430
How will you observe the small intestines
after the surgery?

304
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,600
Another thing...

305
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,140
There is something more important
than enteroenterostomy.

306
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,320
It's blood vessel anastomosis.

307
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,370
Fortunately in this case, there are
uninfected aorta and caval veins remaining...

308
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,080
During the transplant,
if you connect two fixed blood vessels...

309
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,620
The connection can bend,
so the failure rate is high.

310
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,520
If I may add to that...

311
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,580
Taking the microvessles to conduct
the anastomosis...

312
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,640
That will increase the success rate.

313
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,160
You are here to ridicule us again?

314
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,880
If you are here to push us to
make the repayment, there's no need.

315
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,810
We are well aware of the due date.

316
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,220
Why weren't you interested in
protecting the hospital?

317
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,880
What?

318
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,370
You are the one who
brought this upon yourself.

319
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,820
Look here.

320
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
What are you saying?

321
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,590
You are not only losing the hospital
and foundation.

322
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,070
But you and the director are
losing your values.

323
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,180
Get out.

324
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,470
Who are you trying to lecture?

325
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,340
From now on,
listen carefully to what I say.

326
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,090
It's almost time for him to come.

327
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,890
Professor Kim.

328
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,320
You did your best.

329
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,700
You worked hard.

330
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,900
Not bad, right?

331
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,280
In Hye's surgery...

332
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,950
We'll be performing it.

333
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,750
Way to go, Professor!

334
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,810
Why were you putting on a show?

335
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,320
See? This type of acting suits me
much better than Captain Hook.

336
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,050
You're not a hole anymore.

337
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,040
Your acting is full of soul.

338
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,350
Not bad, right?

339
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,260
If you make fun of my acting again,
I'll crush you.

340
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,000
Do you have time today?

341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,090
I was hoping to have a team dinner.
Will it be hard?

342
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,490
It's okay with me.

343
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,460
It works for everyone, right?

344
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

345
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,260
I want some marbled rib eye steak.

346
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,280
Go and buy it yourself, then!

347
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,690
Hello.

348
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,520
You are that doctor from before.

349
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,730
Yes.

350
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,640
How are you feeling?

351
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,670
What are you asking me for?

352
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,900
As you can see,
I'm half-dead already.

353
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,580
But...

354
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,740
What brings you here?

355
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,600
It's because of Shi On.

356
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,510
What has he done?

357
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,200
Father.

358
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,960
You should stop treating him like a child,
and treat him as an adult.

359
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,900
Shi On is a doctor here now.

360
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,830
You'll have to treat him like an adult if you
want Shi On to be a responsible son to you.

361
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,490
If you are going to say that
kind of nonsense, get out!

362
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,640
Please.

363
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,850
Who cares if you are a doctor?

364
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,070
Why are you getting involved in our
family matters?

365
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:19,680
If Shi On's brother were alive,
he would have told you the same thing.

366
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,530
<i>You know...</i>

367
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,430
<i>Should we just date openly?</i>

368
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,590
And tell everyone?

369
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,270
Why?
You think I'll get teased?

370
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,390
- For the pediatrics surgery department!
- Cheers!

371
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,520
Order whatever you want to eat,
except you, Park Shi On.

372
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,750
You all work so hard, but
I've never brought you out before.

373
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,330
It's okay.

374
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,990
We came out on our own.

375
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:24,050
I'm sorry for not being a good
manager to all of you.

376
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,040
No.

377
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,860
We are sorry for not taking
better care of you.

378
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,470
It's okay...

379
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,120
Chief, looking at you closely,
you look like actor Lee Byung Hun.

380
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,450
That kid...
Saying useless things again.

381
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,130
'Tell me.
Were you really going to kill me?'

382
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,690
Maybe we are alike...

383
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,200
But like a dried-up Lee Byung Hun.

384
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,850
What did you say?

385
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,780
Park Shi On.

386
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,750
How dare you talk to the manager
like that?

387
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,540
I'm sorry.

388
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,380
Seriously...

389
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,990
Attention, please!

390
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,500
I...

391
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,540
I'm dating someone.

392
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,040
That's good news!

393
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,320
Then, you're no longer single?

394
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,550
Congratulations.
Who is he?

395
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,840
It's Park Shi On.

396
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,360
Stop kidding around.

397
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,630
Who is it?

398
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,100
It really is Park Shi On.

399
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,720
Seriously...

400
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,970
You shouldn't have said anything, then.

401
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,750
It's true.
It really is Park Shi On.

402
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,810
Really?

403
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,070
Another round of applause.

404
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,680
Are you mad because I announced it
without your permission?

405
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,680
You're worried, then?

406
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,430
It's something we need to
overcome once.

407
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:27,060
We can't do this because of other people.
We don't need to do this.

408
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,290
I know what you are saying.

409
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:38,940
You are happy, too, right?
It feels good?

410
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,190
Yes. It does feel really really good.

411
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,800
You should go back to the hospital.

412
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,490
Yes.

413
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,180
Go.

414
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,190
Okay.

415
00:32:56,825 --> 00:33:09,471
<i>When you feel that it's far,
know that you're not alone</i>

416
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:20,682
<i>I pray your time</i>

417
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:31,627
<i>I pray your faith</i>

418
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:43,739
<i>Whatever it is, nothing can replace you...</i>

419
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,750
Why are you so sad?

420
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,950
It's nothing.

421
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,130
Wow, Park Shi On.

422
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,610
How did you get Dr. Cha
to like you?

423
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,430
You're really something else.

424
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,430
- Shi On.
- Yes?

425
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:20,280
You have that license now.
So, don't lose it.

426
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,120
I won't lose it.

427
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,640
Never.

428
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,360
Good.
Good attitude!

429
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,760
I like that!

430
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,010
How cute.

431
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,170
Dr. Cha and Dr. Park.

432
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,670
But, you look worried.

433
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,750
How can I not worry?

434
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,920
Who are you worried about?

435
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,320
Both of them.

436
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,770
You should congratulate them.

437
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,540
To them, you are their biggest support.

438
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,230
Right...

439
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,630
I had something important to tell you.

440
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,630
- What is it?
- The vice president...

441
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,110
It's something good,
but it feels a bit strange.

442
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:35,620
We can accept it because we're their family,
but it's going to start a rumor.

443
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,230
Why worry about that?
If the two of them are happy, that's all.

444
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,020
That's true, but...

445
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,590
I don't think it will go over well.

446
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,690
You think they are fools?

447
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:48,590
You don't think they thought about that?

448
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,450
This is big...

449
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,300
I knew it when they were
always going around together.

450
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,240
I really don't understand.

451
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,350
He's cute, but how can you
have feelings for him?

452
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,530
I know...

453
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,680
You're gossiping again.

454
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,720
I told you not to gossip here.

455
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,300
<i>Who?</i>

456
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,810
Park Shi On and Cha Yoon Seo?

457
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,970
Yes, the rumor is all over the place.

458
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,880
Cha Yoon Seo...

459
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,070
She was always so arrogant,
and she dates someone like that?

460
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,730
I guess she likes unique people.

461
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,200
You better walk around with
more energy.

462
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,790
Why are you so down?

463
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,560
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,560
- I won't be like this in front of patients...
- Not patients.

465
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,080
How can such a weak guy
take care of a girl?

466
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,470
You'd better get three times as strong.
Stop being a kid.

467
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,830
Do you understand?

468
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,050
Yes, sir.

469
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,150
Why aren't you saying anything?

470
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,330
About what?

471
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,280
About me and Park Shi On.

472
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,320
What can I say about that?

473
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,850
Still...

474
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,890
You're more clever than anyone
else I know.

475
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,950
I'm sure you thought well before
making the decision.

476
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,240
Thank you.

477
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,540
Let's go prepare for the performance.

478
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,010
Yes, please put on your
best performance.

479
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,660
Everyone, what day is today?

480
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,340
The day we watch Peter Pan!

481
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,160
From now on, this is no longer
the pediatrics ward, this is Never Land!

482
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,620
Should we call out Peter Pan?

483
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,810
One.

484
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,030
Two.

485
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,150
Three.

486
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:27,180
Peter Pan!

487
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,540
Again.

488
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,400
Peter Pan!

489
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,060
Hello.

490
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,740
I'm Peter Pan from Never Land.

491
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,740
I'm Wendy.

492
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,870
I'm John.

493
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,420
I'm Michael.

494
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,820
It's so nice to meet all of you.

495
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,690
Peter Pan.

496
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,030
Today is the day I get rid of you.

497
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,460
Do as you wish.

498
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,830
Peter Pan, go and teach that
bad Captain Hook a lesson!

499
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,740
Okay.
Don't worry.

500
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,750
Tinkerbell, please sprinkle the
magic powder!

501
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,950
Why are you walking instead of flying?

502
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,550
I had pork feet for lunch,
so I'm too heavy to fly.

503
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,560
You're not Tinkerbell.

504
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,070
You're Chubbybell.

505
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,080
What are you saying?
You want a piece of me?

506
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,670
You better be prepared,
Chubbybell.

507
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,750
Get up here.
Come on.

508
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,880
Excuse me.

509
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,280
Who are you?

510
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,980
Excuse me.

511
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,330
Who are you, looking so ugly?

512
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,110
I'm the Little Mermaid.

513
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,570
What kind of sea creature are you?

514
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,660
I'm a blonde.

515
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,110
Why are you here?

516
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:30,340
I came to look for a witch who makes
the potion to turn me into a human.

517
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,290
You are mistaken.

518
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,280
You have to take the shuttle bus,
and travel 72,000 stops.

519
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,340
I'm sorry.

520
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,870
We're home, Wendy.

521
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,190
No, I want to go back to
Never Land with you.

522
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,250
You can't.

523
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:09,450
Take her with you.

524
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,950
Don't part with her.

525
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,550
You're still growing.
You can't stay with me.

526
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,610
I'm going to stay with you,
and live as a child forever.

527
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,810
No.

528
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,870
You have to live happily
with everyone here.

529
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,180
Peter Pan.

530
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,690
I have to go now.

531
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,710
Good bye, Wendy.

532
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,280
Peter Pan.

533
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,660
One, two, three.

534
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,410
There's a call from the ER.

535
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,880
A five year old girl fell from a slide.
She has heavy bleeding.

536
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,620
What are you waiting for?

537
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,290
Vitals?

538
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:43,780
It's unstable. The wound is deep,
the rectum may have been damaged.

539
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,960
Park Shi On, get the sonogram ready.

540
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,750
What are you smiling about?

541
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,840
I may not have many around me willing to help,
but I've been blessed with such good students.

542
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,470
I brought the sonogram.

543
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,890
It's all thanks to your dedication.

544
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,070
No.

545
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,780
Look over there.

546
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:22,020
Before they think about healing the patient,
they truly care about the patient.

547
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,780
I only treated my patients out of
a sense of duty.

548
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:31,530
The doctors in the pediatrics surgery
department are indeed different.

549
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,790
Even more so than you.

550
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,830
If you were me,
wouldn't you have been scared?

551
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,040
Of course.

552
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,260
I have nothing to say.

553
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,310
You are really done with
that life style?

554
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,930
Of course.

555
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,320
I can't even remember the
last time I used my fist.

556
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,760
But, how did you get clean?

557
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,560
I heard it's not easy to get out
of that life style.

558
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,200
I had a nephew.

559
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,510
My brother and his wife
died in a car accident.

560
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,990
I raised him.

561
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,410
But, he was very sick.
He had a malignant lymph tumor.

562
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,640
He was more dear to me
than my own child.

563
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:56,310
But I couldn't even take care of him
because I was going around fighting.

564
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,530
All I did was pay for the hospital bills.

565
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,870
And one day...
he left.

566
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:13,360
In a letter he left for me
he said...

567
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,780
'Thank you for being with me.'

568
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,850
'I love you.'

569
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,350
Although I didn't even do
anything for him.

570
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,950
I couldn't even protect him.

571
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,600
That's when I had a change of heart,
and I came here.

572
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:47,720
If there are kids like my nephew,
I want to take care of them.

573
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,130
I thought I would only be able to
forgive myself then.

574
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,820
What's wrong with me?
How embarrassing.

575
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,490
I'm so tired.

576
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,830
Performance...
Surgery...

577
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,010
You should get some rest.

578
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,660
I need to wash my face.

579
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,620
Just sleep.

580
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,670
I can't. If I do,
my skin will look horrible tomorrow.

581
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,230
You will still be pretty.

582
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,140
Let's see if you still say that
tomorrow morning.

583
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,380
But, I really don't think I can get up.
I'm so tired.

584
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,970
I'm just going to sleep.

585
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,650
Then, go to sleep.

586
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,010
I'll go back to the hospital...

587
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,630
Go after I fall asleep.

588
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,460
Yoon Seo!

589
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,490
Hey!

590
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,060
Let's talk.

591
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,780
In this big hospital,
the rumor is everywhere.

592
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,580
What are you going to do?

593
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,280
What do you mean?

594
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,320
Yoon Seo.

595
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,870
- You're not an impulsive person.
- No, I'm not.

596
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,450
I thought hard about it.

597
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,260
I know you are kind-hearted
and sympathetic...

598
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,100
It's not sympathy
or an act of kindness...

599
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,340
I really like him.

600
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,190
What if your mom finds out?

601
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,540
You think you can convince
her to understand?

602
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,860
In the process of trying to convince her,
one of you will get hurt.

603
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,940
Just end it after dating a bit,
or end it now.

604
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:06,870
You may be upset, but I'm
sure this is the right thing to do.

605
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,030
Fortunately, it's not a big cut.

606
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,710
I don't want you to get a scar
on your pretty hand.

607
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,140
Is everything about me pretty to you?

608
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,520
Everything?

609
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,540
This is not good...

610
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:20,840
You're completely blinded
by something.

611
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,890
There's nothing there.

612
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,620
Dr. Cha, are you really okay?

613
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,730
Of course.

614
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:45,780
I'm not only okay,
I feel really good.

615
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:52,960
If something upsetting happens
because of me...

616
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,150
Even if that happens, it's fine.

617
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,700
As long as the two of us are okay.

618
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,900
Tomorrow is finally the day
of In Hye's surgery.

619
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,080
We've been checking thoroughly until now.

620
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:16,680
But her body, whether it be liver, kidney,
or blood vessels, may reject immunization.

621
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:22,650
Even if something goes wrong,
we have to remain calm and take care of it.

622
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,880
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

623
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,690
Should we administer the
immunosuppressant tonight?

624
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,190
Yes.

625
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:33,940
- Administer it quickly.
- Okay.

626
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,880
I need to go over to their ward now.

627
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,810
Don't be scared.

628
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,440
It'll be okay.

629
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,410
Unni.

630
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,670
Why are you crying again?

631
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,940
You're crying, too.

632
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,290
In Hye.

633
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,640
This surgery...

634
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,020
It won't make me lead
a miserable life.

635
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:23,460
It's dividing up happiness into two.

636
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:30,860
When happiness is divided into two,
you know it gets bigger, right?

637
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:42,520
So, don't ever feel bad for me.

638
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,340
Okay.

639
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,120
I won't do that.

640
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,250
I love you,
my one and only sister.

641
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:07,600
I love you, too,
my one and only sister.

642
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,430
In Young.

643
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,740
Yes.

644
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,190
I'm just going to be a fool.

645
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:42,870
I don't want to be a dumb fool...

646
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,850
But I don't mind being this
kind of a fool.

647
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,910
Please bear through the uneasiness
you feel because of me.

648
00:53:55,910 --> 00:54:02,190
I'll make sure that it's all
worth it in the end.

649
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,450
In Hye.

650
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:33,750
If you wait just a bit longer,
you'll get to eat all kinds of good food.

651
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,110
I'll make you really good spaghetti.

652
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:42,320
That's not something you can eat.
It tastes really bad...

653
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:46,110
You two look great.

654
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,730
You're embarrassing me.

655
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,310
Thank you, In Hye.
This is all thanks to you.

656
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,610
The two of you need to be happy.

657
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,530
You sound like a wedding officiant.

658
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:44,458
<i>Smile now, don't be lonely</i>

659
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:58,572
<i>When you think that you're alone,
hold my hand tightly</i>

660
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:13,340
<i>The you that is in my heart is not weak</i>

661
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:20,270
<i>You can cry all you want</i>

662
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:29,550
<i>Because holding it in
doesn't mean you're strong</i>

663
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:35,860
<i>Always love, love yourself</i>

664
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:38,350
Don't worry about anything.

665
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,450
Okay?

666
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,150
Okay.

667
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,900
Dr. Han.

668
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:56,196
<i>Sadness and pain are just keys to happiness</i>

669
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,270
It feels warm.

670
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,500
Not because it's a doctor's hand...

671
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,970
But because it's yours.

672
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,980
Let's start, then.

673
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,040
Scalpel.

674
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,110
We should open up In Hye and wait.

675
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:45,040
Let the donor room know,
so we can start when they are ready.

676
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,110
You have to stay by my side.

677
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,180
No matter what.

678
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,120
Okay, In Hye.

679
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,270
In Hye.

680
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,360
Sleep for a few hours.

681
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,280
Have a good dream.

682
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,540
Anesthesia will begin.

683
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,040
The blood flow looks good.

684
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,370
Let's start.
Mosquito.

685
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,110
Tie.

686
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:34,160
Cut.

687
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,590
Cut.

688
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,370
Cut.

689
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:57,810
It's finished.
Let the recipient know.

690
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:48,060
Vascular forceps.

691
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,660
Vascular forceps.

692
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,440
One more.

693
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,310
<i>In Hye, it's almost finished now.</i>

694
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,830
<i>Hang in there.</i>

695
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,380
<i>Just a bit more.</i>

696
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,470
It's done.

697
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:09,070
- Finish up, and move her to the aseptic room.
- Good job.

698
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,800
Good job.

699
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,400
She should be waking up from
the anesthesia, why isn't she up, yet?

700
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,330
Let's wait a bit more.

701
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,310
Yes.

702
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,410
What happened?

703
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,630
Her breathing hasn't returned,
and her BP is low.

704
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:03,770
In Hye.

705
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,280
D.I.C...

706
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,170
D.I.C?

707
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:13,240
Then, there's bleeding inside the stomach...
- Then we can't stop the bleeding.

708
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,080
If the bleeding doesn't stop,
she may never wake up.
