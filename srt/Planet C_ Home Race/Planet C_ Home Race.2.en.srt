No, Chen Bowen and I worked on it together.

525
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,300
Oh, Chen Bowen is a great dancer.

526
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:33,700
I saw Chen Bowen on video and he really stood out.

527
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:35,700
[Thank you so much~!]
He's really good, seriously.

534
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:53,567
Yes, yes.

536
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,900
Yes, yes.

537

[Chen Bowen's throat doesn't seem in good condition]
Uh... his voice...

538
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,200
His throat hurts, and he lost his voice.

539
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,533
It hurts a lot today, it's not good.

540
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:03,267
It's not good?

541
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:03,967

Okay...

546
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:21,233
When I woke up this morning, my voice was like this, so...

547
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:22,967
ah... I'm screwed.

548
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,500
Whether it's on the stage or during the interim check, I want to do my best there.

549

551
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,333
I'll... do... my best...

[The interim check suddenly becomes ASMR]
His voice suddenly...

553

[ASMR mode]
Ah... okay... do your... best...

554
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:47,800
Main Dancer and Main Vocal, that's a huge responsibility, a lot of pressure.

555
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,933
You must've practiced too much.

556
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,767
Fan Zheyi, how are you adjusting to team Drama? Do you keep up with practice?

557
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,433
[Well...]

558

564

[Watching closely...]

566
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:19,333
There were parts where it was hard to keep up with the choreography,

567
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:24,000
but Chen Bowen and leader Li Zihao helped me a lot (so it's fine now).

568
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,800
(Personally) My position (as a Master) is dance, Fan Zheyi.

569
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,533
I think I need to change it now.

570
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,333
[Shocking confession]

571
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,133
[Confused]
Do you need to change it now?

572
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,033
Yes.

[Team Drama deeply focused on practice]

574
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:42,567
It will look better if you add head movements.

575
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,267
[Why isn't this working?]

576
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,200
[Fan Zheyi is still unfamiliar with the choreography]

577
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:53,033
Why can't I put any power into this?

578
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,800
I joined this team late, so I'm behind on the choreography.

579
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,700
This is so good! I'm so happy I get to dance this!

580
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:00,733
Really?

581
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,967
I'm not sure how much power to put into it.

582
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:07,200
It's good if it's powerful, but don't overdo your facial expressions.

583

[Practicing again after Xie Binghua's advice]

584
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:18,400
If I don't show improvement after transferring teams, I think I'll definitely get more criticism.

585
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,533

Is this an original choreography?

Creating a "pair choreography" is the mission.

597
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,233

[The intense amount of practice that can be felt from the floor]

It's that passion you don't feel often anymore.

It was so good, it didn't even feel like one. You just jump in, fill the gaps.

616

Since Chen Bowen couldn't hit (the high note), Li Zihao stepped in, right?

Ah, yes, I came and stepped in.

Amazing, Li Zihao!

After all, since Li Zihao has performed on stage so many times, he seems to have a good understandin

626

1719
01:50:00,233 --> 01:50:01,500
DRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!

1720
01:50:01,867 --> 01:50:04,900
[Only the ruthless ones survive]

1721
01:50:04,933 --> 01:50:06,400
[This is a battle of pride]
Everyone, come on in!

1722
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,400
[Who will be the winner of this brutal physical showdown?]
Let's go!

1723
01:50:11,433 --> 01:50:12,833
[Who will be the winner of this brutal physical showdown?]
Yeah! I can do it!

1724
01:50:17,267 --> 01:50:19,133
What is your ultimate dream?

1725
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,700
Debut.

1726
01:50:22,967 --> 01:50:24,633
I kept longing for it.

1727
01:50:25,067 --> 01:50:29,467
Honestly, I think of this as my final challenge.

1728
01:50:29,767 --> 01:50:35,100
If I can't debut this time, I feel like I'll never get another chance.

1729
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:37,167
I came here with the goal to debut.

1730
01:50:37,233 --> 01:50:40,033
I absolutely need to debut here.

1731
01:50:40,267 --> 01:50:41,700
I have to survive.

1732
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:45,900
On HOME RACE, I will survive until the very end.

1733
01:50:46,233 --> 01:50:48,300
I really want to survive.

1734
01:50:48,333 --> 01:50:53,100
[Next week, the Survival Announcement Ceremony]
