[To Planet Maker: Please take care of us~! >_<]
Planet Maker.

352
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,333
Planet Maker not only decides your survival and elimination.

353
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,333
Mission Songs, Killing Parts, Dance, New Songs.

354
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,733
They determine everything related to you.

355
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,700
Oh my god...

356
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,867
Has it been done this way (that determines everything) before?

357
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,600
Planet Maker have a lot of power.

358
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,667
(With this method) It's a new experience,

359
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,867
so I'm looking forward to it!

360
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,133
Alright, now,

361
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:55,767
not only it is the spiritual pillar of PLANET C : HOME RACE,

362
00:17:55,767 --> 00:18:01,000
to lead your race the best, we will introduce the K-POP legend artist.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Master?

364
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,833
Who is it?

365
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:07,700
PLANET C : HOME RACE's Chief Master,

366
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,100
Kim Jaejoong.

367
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:24,000
I am very excited to see Chief Master Kim Jaejoong again.

368
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:31,667
[He who leads BOYS II PLANET has a warm sensibility!]

369
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:32,967
Are you doing well?

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,533
Yes~!

371
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,200
It feels so good to see all of you once again!

372
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,400
[So are we!]

373
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:47,567
For everyone who is ready to run with all their strength, in order to guide you on the way to your d

374
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,933
standing again as your Chief Master, I'm Kim Jaejoong.

375
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,100
[Warm welcome]

376
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,367
I missed you!

377
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:03,900
Before we begin, has everyone received the class assigned for now?

378
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,967
Isn't it a fight between TOP, MID and LOW classes?

379
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,467
[No way...]
Isn't it a fight between TOP, MID and LOW classes?

380
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:15,967
Everyone will compete for their debut through the upcoming Home Race.

381
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,033
The closest class to debut, TOP class.

382
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,533
Where further upgrades are needed, MID class.

383
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,000
Then, the lowest grade, LOW class.

384
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:27,233
There are three classes in total.

385
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,633
So TOP class is the best...

386
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,200
Of course it's the best!

387
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:33,333
I must hold (well) onto TOP class.

388
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:38,433
The three classes you have now... were...

389
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,833
all determined by the choices of Planet Maker.

390
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,233
Turns out that it was really decided by Planet Maker...

391
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,167
Woah, cool!

392
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,067
Planet Maker will decide everything from TOP class to LOW class.

393
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,433
According to Planet Maker's selection and support order... six people each!

394
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,300
TOP class.

395
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,167
MID class.

396
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,600
LOW class, and this way.

397
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,067
Everyone's class has been determined.

398
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:13,000
So we were divided into TOP, MID and LOW class based on votes...

399
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,167
I'm really grateful to Planet Maker... for making me TOP class.

400
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,833
I hope I am TOP class until the end.

401
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,567
I feel a little sad.

402
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,667
After three years (of survival shows), I still feel like I haven't received recognition...

403
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:34,200
So (after this), I must showcase myself well, so that more Planet Maker can choose me.

404
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
I can't do something about it, but I'll work hard.

That seems too cruel...

00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,267

412
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,367
[The fierce battle has already begun]
No, you are the person challenging me.

It's so fun! It's so fun!

415
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,033
[The fierce battle has already begun]
It really is a battle...

416
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,400
[And a moment later]

[Fierce stages unfold to determine the true winner!!]

418
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,600
Then, let's reveal the long-awaited first round of missions!

419
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,467
Announced this soon?

420
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,267
Ah, the most expected things!

421
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,567
Ah... what's the first mission?

422
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:23,800
It's the... Planet Maker Producing Battle.

423
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,000
Planet Maker Producing?

424
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,900
[What is this?]
Planet Maker Producing Battle?

425
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:33,533
'Planet Maker Producing Battle' is the mission where Planet Maker become a producer.

426
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:41,567
This is a battle that consists of the results determining key elements, such as the mission's songs

427
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,067
Planet Maker (directly) producing for us...

428
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,200
It feels fresh!

429
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,700
I want to do everything that they (Planet Maker) choose.

430
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,033
I'm looking forward to it.

431
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,433
So, how will the Planet Maker Producing Battle proceed?

432
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,900
In BOYS II PLANET, the stage evaluations were conducted through on-site evaluations.

433
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,933
In PLANET C : HOME RACE, it will not be conducted through on-site evaluations.

434
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,167
[Then what is it?]

435
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:13,433
It will be conducted through online evaluations, instead.

436
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,900
[Is this for real?]
It will be conducted through online evaluations, instead.

437
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:17,700
Woah!

438
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,800
Oh my god...

439
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,467
What does online voting mean?

440
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,800
There are no fans (on-site) where the live performance takes place.

441
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,033
They watch it (online instead).

442
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh my god...

443
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:38,533
Because it is conducted through an online evaluation, all Planet Maker around the world will be able

444
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,067
All Planet Maker around the world will watch us at the same time.

445
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,600
10.000! 100.000! 1.000.000 people will watch (and evaluate) us,

446
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,300
so I have to do better, I need to work harder.

447
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,033
And,

448
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,467
[What else is still left?]

449
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,900
The Planet Maker Producing Battle will proceed as a team battle.

450
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:01,467
Ah? Team battle?

451
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,267
Let's go bro~.

452
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,933
Let's go bro~.

453
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,200
[Planet Maker Producing Battle will have 3 teams of 6 people]
Everyone will be divided into 3 teams

[Tension]

458
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:31,400
What role will the final score obtained by the three teams play?

Benefit?

460
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Benefit.

461
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,433
In the Planet Maker Producing Battle, according to the final ranking of each team,

462
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:44,767
the survivors... and the elimination candidates...

463
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:47,733
[Elimination candidates?]

464
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,733
will be determined.

465
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,867
I was very surprised.

466
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,433
Elimination candidates?

467
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm very scared...

468
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:03,200
The (stage's) results of the three teams will determine the survival and elimination candidates.

469
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:07,400
If you lose, you may become an elimination candidate...

470
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:10,333
[A long sigh]

471
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,067
My current class is LOW class...

472
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,700
If I want to survive the first round of missions, our team must get first place.

473
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,833
The team that ranks first according to its final ranking...

474
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,233
The entire team,

475
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,367
Survives?

476
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,933
the six members...

477
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,433
will survive!

478
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,567
Woaaaaaaaaah!

479
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,767
I really want to get first place.

480
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,967
Woah, that's a bene-... benefi-... beneis-... benif-... beneshelf...

481
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,433
The first place is invincible.

482
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:47,367
You have to choose the song well.

483
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,500
We don't choose the song.

484
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Oh yeah.

485
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,500
The team at second place, half of its members...

486
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:56,000
[No way...!]

487
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:59,867
3 of their members will become elimination candidates.

488
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,167
When I heard the words "elimination candidate", my heart hurt.

489
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,067
3 people!?

490
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:11,367
If 3 people could get eliminated for second place, everyone could get eliminated for last place.

491
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm getting less and less confident...

492
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:18,367
And lastly, the team at last place.

493
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:19,967
Everyone?

494
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,400
The entire team!

495
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,833
Their 6 members...

496
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,333
become elimination candidates.

497
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,433
become elimination candidates.

498
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,167
Agh, no way...

499
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,133
I must not be at last place.

500
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,333
That's terrifying...

501
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:41,667
Somehow it feels even more cruel than BOYS II PLANET.

502
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,467
It all depends on us on the stage.

503
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:47,567
I never imagined this.

504
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:52,067
It seems cruel that an entire team is now up for elimination.

505
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:57,567
No matter how good your (individual) skills are, you (team's place) could still be last place.

506
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,567
If you're not first, there's no solution to this.

507
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:10,400
Planet Maker Producing Battle will be the fiercest and most brutal contest of any team battle.

508
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,967
And what everyone might be wondering...

509
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:18,367
I will announce the mission songs.

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,833
[The Planet Maker Producing Battle songs will finally be revealed!]

511
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,167
The most important. The most important.

Finally, (the moment) has arrived?

513
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:36,467
For this battle, Planet Maker have selected the mission songs for everyone.

Why are you saying that (to me)?

I know my skills are lacking,

1874
01:40:59,667 --> 01:41:10,300
so I didn't plan to try for HOME RACE, but I applied because I really wanted to become a singer.

It's hard.

Have you ever wanted to quit?

1879

No, because I made a promise to Planet Maker.

1880
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:45,867
I never even considered that for our team or for Planet Maker.

1881

Am I not suited to being a leader?

I really don't want to do an embarrassing stage, you know?

You're already doing great.

Sometimes I do that without even realizing it,

1891

but...

1892
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,500
When I see you... you remind me of myself (back in BOYS II PLANET days).

1893

01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:08,000
I worked my heart out like I was dying, so I managed to pull off the stage.

That was... really exciting, you know?

(You too) Try imagining yourself stepping onto the stage.

1907

Jack is certainly lacking, but he is definitely working hard.

You were sweating more than anyone else,

1909
