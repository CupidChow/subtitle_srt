00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,333
Planet Maker not only decides your survival and elimination.

353
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,367
Mission Songs, Killing Parts, Dance, New Songs.

354
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:36,767
They determine everything related to you.

355
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,733
Oh my god...

356
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,900
Has it been done this way (that determines everything) before?

357
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,600
Planet Maker have a lot of power.

358
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,700
(With this method) It's a new experience,

359
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,867
so I'm looking forward to it!

360
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,167
Alright, now,

361
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:55,800
not only it is the spiritual pillar of PLANET C : HOME RACE,

362
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,033
to lead your race the best, we will introduce the K-POP legend artist.

363
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:02,033
Master?

364
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:03,867
Who is it?

365
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,733
PLANET C : HOME RACE's Chief Master,

366
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,133
Kim Jaejoong.

367
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:24,033
I am very excited to see Chief Master Kim Jaejoong again.

368
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:31,667
[He who leads BOYS II PLANET has a warm sensibility!]

369
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:33,000
Are you doing well?

370
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,567
Yes~!

371
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,200
It feels so good to see all of you once again!

372
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:41,433
[So are we!]

373
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:47,567
For everyone who is ready to run with all their strength, in order to guide you on the way to your d

374
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,967
standing again as your Chief Master, I'm Kim Jaejoong.

375
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,133
[Warm welcome]

376
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,400
I missed you!

377
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:03,933
Before we begin, has everyone received the class assigned for now?

378
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:10,000
Isn't it a fight between TOP, MID and LOW classes?

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
[No way...]
Isn't it a fight between TOP, MID and LOW classes?

380
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:16,000
Everyone will compete for their debut through the upcoming Home Race.

381
00:19:16,433 --> 00:19:19,067
The closest class to debut, TOP class.

382
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,533
Where further upgrades are needed, MID class.

383
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,000
Then, the lowest grade, LOW class.

384
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,267
There are three classes in total.

385
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,667
So TOP class is the best...

386
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,233
Of course it's the best!

387
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,367
I must hold (well) onto TOP class.

388
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:38,467
The three classes you have now... were...

389
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,833
all determined by the choices of Planet Maker.

390
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,267
Turns out that it was really decided by Planet Maker...

391
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,167
Woah, cool!

392
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,100
Planet Maker will decide everything from TOP class to LOW class.

393
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:57,433
According to Planet Maker's selection and support order... six people each!

394
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,333
TOP class.

395
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,167
MID class.

396
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,600
LOW class, and this way.

397
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,100
Everyone's class has been determined.

398
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,000
So we were divided into TOP, MID and LOW class based on votes...

399
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,167
I'm really grateful to Planet Maker... for making me TOP class.

400
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,867
I hope I am TOP class until the end.

401
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,600
I feel a little sad.

402
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:28,700
After three years (of survival shows), I still feel like I haven't received recognition...

403
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:34,200
So (after this), I must showcase myself well, so that more Planet Maker can choose me.

404
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,133
I can't do something about it, but I'll work hard.

405
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,800
[The even more brutal and shocking rules of PLANET C]
After Planet Maker Producing Battle, based on

406
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,967
[The even more brutal and shocking rules of PLANET C]
they will be ___.

407
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,033
[The even more brutal and shocking rules of PLANET C]
That seems too cruel...

408
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,567
[The even more brutal and shocking rules of PLANET C]

409
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:49,067
[The fierce battle has already begun]

410
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:52,100
[The fierce battle has already begun]
Who is main rapper!?

411
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,267
[The fierce battle has already begun]
I'll go first?

412
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,400
[The fierce battle has already begun]
No, you are the person challenging me.

413
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,967
[The fierce battle has already begun]

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
[The fierce battle has already begun]
It's so fun! It's so fun!

415
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,067
[The fierce battle has already begun]
It really is a battle...

416
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,433
[And a moment later]

417
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:07,467
[Fierce stages unfold to determine the true winner!!]

418
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:12,600
Then, let's reveal the long-awaited first round of missions!

419
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,500
Announced this soon?

420
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,267
Ah, the most expected things!

421
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,600
Ah... what's the first mission?

422
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:23,800
It's the... Planet Maker Producing Battle.

423
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,033
Planet Maker Producing?

424
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:27,900
[What is this?]
Planet Maker Producing Battle?

425
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:33,567
'Planet Maker Producing Battle' is the mission where Planet Maker become a producer.

426
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:41,600
This is a battle that consists of the results determining key elements, such as the mission's songs

427
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,100
Planet Maker (directly) producing for us...

428
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,200
It feels fresh!

429
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,733
I want to do everything that they (Planet Maker) choose.

430
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,067
I'm looking forward to it.

431
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:57,433
So, how will the Planet Maker Producing Battle proceed?

432
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,933
In BOYS II PLANET, the stage evaluations were conducted through on-site evaluations.

433
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:07,967
In PLANET C : HOME RACE, it will not be conducted through on-site evaluations.

434
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,167
[Then what is it?]

435
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,433
It will be conducted through online evaluations, instead.

436
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,900
[Is this for real?]
It will be conducted through online evaluations, instead.

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,733
Woah!

438
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:18,833
Oh my god...

439
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,833
There are no fans (on-site) where the live performance takes place.

440
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,033
They watch it (online instead).

441
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,033
Oh my god...

442
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:38,567
Because it is conducted through an online evaluation, all Planet Maker around the world will be able

443
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:44,067
All Planet Maker around the world will watch us at the same time.

444
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,600
10,000! 100,000! 1,000,000 people will watch (and evaluate) us,

445
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,333
so I have to do better, I need to work harder.

446
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:52,033
And,

447
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,500
[What else is still left?]

448
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:59,900
The Planet Maker Producing Battle will proceed as a team battle.

449
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,500
Ah? Team battle?

450
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,300
Let's go bro~.

451
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,967
Let's go bro~.

452
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,200
[Planet Maker Producing Battle will have 3 teams of 6 people]
Everyone will be divided into 3 teams

453
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:13,433
[Planet Maker Producing Battle will have 3 teams of 6 people]
After the Planet Maker Producing Battl

454
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,667

Then, after the results of the online evaluations, the final results for the three teams will be det

456
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,167
[Tension]

457
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:31,400
What role will the final score obtained by the three teams play?

458
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:32,633
Benefit?

459
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:33,733
Benefit.

460
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:40,467
In the Planet Maker Producing Battle, according to the final ranking of each team,

461
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,767
the survivors... and the elimination candidates...

462
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,767
[Elimination candidates?]

463
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:49,767
will be determined.

464
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,900
I was very surprised.

465
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,467
Elimination candidates?

466
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm very scared...

467
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:03,233
The (stage's) results of the three teams will determine the survival and elimination candidates.

468
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,400
If you lose, you may become an elimination candidate...

469
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,367
[A long sigh]

470
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,100
My current class is LOW class...

471
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:19,733
If I want to survive the first round of missions, our team must get first place.

472
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,867
The team that ranks first according to its final ranking...

473
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,267
The entire team,

474
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,367
Survives?

475
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,967
the six members...

476
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,467
will survive!

477
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,567
Woaaaaaaaaah!

478
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:37,800
I really want to get first place.

479
00:24:38,433 --> 00:24:42,967
Woah, that's a bene-... benefi-... beneis-... benif-... beneshelf...

480
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,433
The first place is invincible.

481
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,400
You have to choose the song well.

482
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,533
We don't choose the song.

483
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:49,533
Oh yeah.

484
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:54,533
The team at second place, half of its members...

485
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,000
[No way...!]

486
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:59,867
3 of their members will become elimination candidates.

487
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,167
When I heard the words "elimination candidate", my heart hurt.

488
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,067
3 people!?

489
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:11,400
If 3 people could get eliminated for second place, everyone could get eliminated for last place.

490
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,733
I'm getting less and less confident...

491
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:18,400
And lastly, the team at last place.

492
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Everyone?

493
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,433
The entire team!

494
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,867
Their 6 members...

495
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,367
become elimination candidates.

496
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,467
become elimination candidates.

497
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,167
Agh, no way...

498
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,133
I must not be at last place.

499
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,333
That's terrifying...

500
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:41,700
Somehow it feels even more cruel than BOYS II PLANET.

501
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:44,500
It all depends on us on the stage.

502
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I never imagined this.

503
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:52,100
It seems cruel that an entire team is now up for elimination.

504
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,600
No matter how good your (individual) skills are, you (team's place) could still be last place.

505
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
If you're not first, there's no solution to this.

506
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:10,400
Planet Maker Producing Battle will be the fiercest and most brutal contest of any team battle.

507
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,967
And what everyone might be wondering...

508
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:18,400
I will announce the mission songs.

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,867
[The Planet Maker Producing Battle songs will finally be revealed!]

510
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:25,167
The most important. The most important.

00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,600
Finally, (the moment) has arrived?

512
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,500
For this battle, Planet Maker have selected the mission songs for everyone.

513
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,567
Please, let's be on the same page.
