Episode 16

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's Qin! It's Qin!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Your Highness, this is poison.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Two days ago, the Princess hurt the Qin Childe of the State Uncle's mansion.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And made the old Madam Shen kneel for two days.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The Empress Dowager was furious.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Your Highness, she worked hard for you for a few days.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm afraid that the antidote was not taken by His Majesty.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The antidote?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It turns out that the Empress is a woman.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Empress is a woman.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There must be a chance.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today is the wedding of the Prince.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
His Majesty is at home.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Princess, where are you going?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hold tight.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is Princess Jianghe.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I heard that you were ruined by the bandits.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tell me how they were ruined.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm talking to you.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't have time to talk to you now.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Move away.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Li Momo, open your mouth.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How dare you not listen to Princess Jianghe?

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't blame me for not giving you face.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is a death sentence.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You...

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you doing?
