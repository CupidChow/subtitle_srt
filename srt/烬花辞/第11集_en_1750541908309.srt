Episode 16

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Uncle, Shen Ning is a witch.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
She used the demon to control...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Get lost!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uncle!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You want to see the new emperor?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Shi Qin!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Your Highness!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Everyone who came to this room

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
will be killed by me.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've given Princess Jiahe a good name.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You don't have to risk your life.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you want to thank me for saving your life,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
go find someone

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
named Han Xun.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Han Xun is on his way.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He's chasing after me.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to recognize Han Xun.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Impossible.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There's no such thing in the world.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just that

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the road to Nanzhao is long.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We have to find something else

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
to do during this time.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you have to go back?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The beauty of Huachang Pei

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is not as beautiful as you.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're right.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
People say that you're a good wife.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I think

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
a good look

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
makes people feel more comfortable.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If they don't like me,

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'd better not go back.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So what if they don't like you?

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The Zhen's Mansion treats you like this.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You don't want to

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
take a credit for yourself.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The End
