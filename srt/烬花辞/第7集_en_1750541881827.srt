1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:00,960
Somebody!

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,320
Hide Shen Ning now!

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,080
Catch her until she dies!

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,680
This is...

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,560
Lord Regent.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,040
Shen Ning is my wife.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,520
Evangelial is not our enemy.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Moreover, the crime is death.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Your Highness, you killed a servant.

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
These servants are under the order of Jiahe.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
But today, Jiahe will kneel down and kneel down and confess.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Let's forget about this.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Your Majesty, do you want to give a thousand-yuan coin to the Crown Princess Di?

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I don't want to say it for the second time.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,800
If Jiahe doesn't want to give out the nine-yuan star-sweeper tomorrow,

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
then I'll kneel down.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Then I'll kneel down.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Wangji, you'd better kneel down.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Today, the day will be bright and the sky will be bright.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
You'd better not fall into the trap.

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Ji Yucang,

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
how long will you pretend?
