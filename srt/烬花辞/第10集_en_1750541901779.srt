00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,600
The Empress Dowager didn't make things difficult for you.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,800
The Empress Dowager is kind.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,200
His Majesty is also kind.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
You wouldn't have killed them all, right?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,800
What?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Prince Regent thinks that he's the one who took them?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
He's just an heartless executioner.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,200
Could it be that he used the soul of the dead?

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,200
It seems that the truth is out of the question.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm afraid that no one will find out.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
You'd better not use your qi and magic again.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
You can kill them directly.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
The antidote.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Why did he follow the order of the left army?

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
He even found out the two useless people in the palace.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Are they still suspicious of me?

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
The antidote.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
The antidote is poisonous?

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
The poison I created

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
only causes pain in the lungs,

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
but it's not fatal.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
If you don't take the medicine,

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
it will hurt for three days.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
But if you take the medicine,

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
you will sleep for three days.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
It seems that the emperor in the world

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
can't tolerate someone as powerful as Ben Ling.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
It seems that the qi and magic of the Qing Dynasty

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
is his.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
There is also a ingredient that can be consumed in the antidote.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
If you take too much, you will be controlled.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
How about

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I help you?

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
What?

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Is the regent shy?

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Nonsense.

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
It hurts a little.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
It's good that you're at ease.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Aren't you curious

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
that I will use needles?

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
You marry me.

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
What is your purpose?

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Does he know the secret of the magic?

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
How does he know this magic?

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Get up.

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
This way,

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
the queen will be more convenient for me.

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
If the queen wants to test me,

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
she can try other ways.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
The trick of self-sacrifice is too dangerous.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
What do you know?

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
The god of nature is powerful,

54
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
and the martial arts are strong.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
He can do magic and medical skills.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
You look like someone I know.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Who?

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Even if you don't kill me,

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I can only live for two years.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Before I die,

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
I have to kill Nanzhao.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Why do you want to kill Nanzhao?

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
You ask yourself, you don't know.

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Do you remember telling me

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
that you have never liked anyone?

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
You mean

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
the same person?

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
His name is

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Nanzhao.

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Does he really know

71
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
that I am the one who tested him?

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
No, it's impossible.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't wait for the princess to take this demon down.
