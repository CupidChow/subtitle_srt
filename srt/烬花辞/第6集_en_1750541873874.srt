Episode 16

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,720
You bitch!

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,720
Stop her!

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,560
Your Highness.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm a princess.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,080
If you hurt me,

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,600
His Majesty won't let you go.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,080
What's wrong?

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,080
Can you still hold on?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm fine.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
But the night of the wedding was so cold.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,520
You must be the same person.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Uncle, save me!

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Do you like the gift I gave you?

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
My wedding dress

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,920
is not as bad as the one in my previous life.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,040
Because of the royal family and the emperor,

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
they killed me.

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,800
Uncle.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
Shen Ning is a devil.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,200
Kill her now!

22
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,520
You're the one who's talking.

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,280
Your teaching

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,040
is not important.

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,520
You deserve it.

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,480
Kneel down and bow to her.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,880
Uncle.

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,680
Shut up!

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,520
I said she was a princess.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,840
But I don't think

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm a little different

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,160
from her today.

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,320
Uncle.

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,480
Kneel down.

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,880
You...

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,960
Bitch.

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Wait for me.

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,760
I'll teach you a lesson.

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,480
How dare you!
