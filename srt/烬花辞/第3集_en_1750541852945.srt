1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,700
We Hö Excel Mæ

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,760
Your irrigations, My consultant to His Highness.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,980
This is the friend of Shen Zheng Mè for a few times.

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,100
You want to die? Don't drag the Shen Family into this.

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
Kneel down.

6
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,220
As the Prince Regent,

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm not worthy of your love.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,620
I'm here to see the Princess Consort.

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,020
His Majesty has ordered

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,380
to grant the marriage of the Shen Family to the Prince Regent.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,500
He will send an imperial eunuch to save her later.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,820
Grandmother,

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,540
as the Princess Consort,

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,380
my father will be a high official in the future.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,300
The legitimate daughter of the Shen Family, Shen Ning.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,660
The blue star is the most similar to me.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,700
Me?

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,860
I don't know when I

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,420
will be able to get the blue star.

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,500
Is it possible for the Prince Regent to believe it?

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,180
If I say so,

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
then it's true.

23
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,660
Shen Ning lost her reputation on the mountain.

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,260
I'm afraid that His Majesty's marriage

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,740
was wrong.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,620
Prince Regent,

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,620
the marriage you're talking about is Shen Yan, right?

28
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm Shen Yan.

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,820
I'm Shen Yan.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,820
I'm Shen Yan.

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,860
The Princess Consort has lost her reputation.

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,300
I gave her a gift.

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,820
Why did she ask for it?

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
And she's so mean.

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Forget it.

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,660
She's a cheat.

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,100
I'll marry her.

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,100
I'll kill her

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,820
to prove it.

40
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Should I kill them all?
