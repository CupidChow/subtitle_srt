1
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:50,468
Found her!

2
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,572
This way!

3
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,231
I guess it was just a drill again,
not a real escape.

4
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:02,683
You're wondering what that is, aren't you?

5
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,459
Going up and down.

6
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:07,634
You see,

7
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,381
when you look from the outside,
it looks so much fun.

8
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:16,111
But when you're actually on the ride,
it feels terrible.

9
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,139
I guess that's how life works.

10
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,430
There are consequences for your actions.

11
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:30,939
Karma, if you will.

12
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:45,589
FAMILY MATTERS

13
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,420
How dare you take pictures?

14
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,082
What you did to Ji-woo was unforgivable.

15
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,876
So it's only fair
that you experience a nightmare.

16
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,124
Something that you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

17
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:10,406
SIN

18
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:14,176
Oh dear, it seems I'm 300g short.

19
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,107
I must have lost my touch.

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,313
What, does it hurt?

21
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:27,729
You think it's unfair?

22
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,619
Something you want to say?

23
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,505
Fuck, it wasn't me!

24
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:44,474
I didn't make those pictures,
blackmail them, and share them online!

25
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,294
It was Jae-gon!

26
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:51,066
He did all those things!
The student president!

27
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,013
Holy shit.

28
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,034
Shit.

29
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,587
These are killer shots.

30
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:22,164
This is bad.

31
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:24,347
I may be good at slicing things

32
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:27,030
but I'm not good at patching things up.

33
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,999
Let go, come on.

34
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,217
Here.

35
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:43,714
Okay.

36
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,239
So you're saying my boy Kyu-tae...

37
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,402
Goddamnit.

38
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,794
He was beat up by this new girl?

39
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,388
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,006
Oh, they're twins. One of them is a boy.

41
00:04:58,588 --> 00:04:59,738
I knew it.

42
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,715
He didn't get beat up by a girl!

43
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,647
No, it was the girl who beat him up.

44
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:17,484
Where does she live?

45
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:20,306
How should I know? It was their first day.

46
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:27,530
Don't open your mouth like a pig
when you don't have anything to tell me!

47
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:28,453
Go.

48
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:30,947
Now?

49
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,507
Go, you bastard!

50
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,888
But there's so much left.

51
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,670
The number you dialed is unavailable--

52
00:05:43,753 --> 00:05:47,816
Where the hell is he,
doing god knows what?

53
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:53,903
SIN

54
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:01,343
It wasn't supposed to go down like this.

55
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,006
You froze up, right?

56
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,478
The first time is tough for anyone.

57
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,378
That's normal.

58
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,065
Who the hell is she?

59
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,736
Why, she's your mom.

60
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,004
Grandpa!

61
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,643
I know.

62
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:47,608
You must be upset and frustrated.

63
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,584
It will all be okay tomorrow.

64
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,263
I'll drop him off by his house
in the morning,

65
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,783
so don't worry so much.

66
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:16,179
I don't.

67
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,943
- I'll go with you tomorrow.
- No.

68
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,812
Things can get ugly
when there's a man around.

69
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,129
I am worried, though.

70
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,308
I know.

71
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:32,945
Ji-woo must be in shock.

72
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,120
Ji-woo is one thing

73
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:37,184
and there's Ji-hoon.

74
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:39,643
What about Ji-hoon?

75
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,931
It wasn't his first time.

76
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,102
I know.

77
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:46,008
But today...

78
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,540
he was smiling the whole time.

79
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,114
He was smiling?

80
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,712
KUMSU CITY INFORMATION CENTER
CONTROL ROOM

81
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:46,151
Hold it there.

82
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,041
What? What is it?

83
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,043
Look.

84
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:53,989
When this SUV passed,
there were no other cars around.

85
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,124
And stop here.

86
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,036
On the next screen here,

87
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,373
this vehicle pops out of nowhere, see?

88
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,004
Come on. What about it?

89
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,956
There must have been a backroad
in between the roads.

90
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,646
No, there isn't any road
a vehicle can enter.

91
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,406
What?

92
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:14,438
But there is an entrance
leading to the Kumsuak Mountain trails

93
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,295
between these shots.

94
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,313
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

95
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,253
So, have you looked around?

96
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,667
The arcade, internet cafe,
bowling alley...

97
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,589
We've searched every hangout
but couldn't find him.

98
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:55,554
Where is this jackass,
doing god knows what?

99
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:58,444
Excuse me, coming through.

100
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,517
Hey!

101
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,905
Kyu-tae, you dumbass,
what happened to you?

102
00:10:03,988 --> 00:10:06,100
- Dad!
- What is it?

103
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,444
Are you hurt?
Why are you in a wheelchair?

104
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,334
Well, someone...

105
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,415
What are you doing?

106
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:16,411
SIN

107
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,724
They butchered my leg!

108
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,788
Your leg?

109
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,199
What about your leg?

110
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,120
Can't you see?

111
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,960
Look here.

112
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:30,189
It was sliced out
and then patched back up.

113
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:33,671
Where, here?

114
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:35,768
Where? You mean here?

115
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,187
Jeez, what have you been doing,
you bastard?

116
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,693
Okay, put those pants back up.
Why would you pull them down?

117
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:51,065
Dad! This fucking hurts like hell!

118
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,678
What the hell happened? Damn it.

119
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,115
What is this?

120
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,142
It's okay, it's like supplements.

121
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,037
You seemed restless.

122
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,756
It will help you sleep tight.

123
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,227
It wasn't me!

124
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:30,481
I didn't make those pictures,
blackmail them, and share them online!

125
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,226
Jae-gon did all those things!
The student president!

126
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:45,141
So you're saying,
my son got beat up by your kids, no,

127
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,100
they got into a fight.

128
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,671
And you called him over
so that the kids made up

129
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,766
and he slept over at your place?

130
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,566
Yes.

131
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,593
Then what the hell's wrong with him?

132
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,014
I'm sorry.

133
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:08,616
Seeing him like this, it made me lose it.

134
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,003
It's okay.

135
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:13,008
I would've reacted the same way.

136
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:16,514
But are you really their mom?

137
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,988
You look young for your age.

138
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,324
No, I am actually young.

139
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:23,859
I see.

140
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,108
After meeting Kyu-tae,

141
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:29,268
I figured
Kyu-tae must cause you lots of trouble.

142
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:33,365
Well, boys will be boys
and get into a fight every now and then.

143
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:36,151
No, actually Kyu-tae is...

144
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,783
quite a...

145
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,703
lame.

146
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,262
"Lame"?

147
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:47,016
He's the school bully.

148
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,686
He acts all tough
but you never know what he's feeling.

149
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,826
He must be having nightmares.

150
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,799
In his sleep...

151
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,893
he even wet the bed.

152
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,129
Tenth graders are
usually too old for that.

153
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:02,797
He wet the bed?

154
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,505
I felt so bad for him,

155
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,900
so I gave him supplements
and let him sleep.

156
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,992
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.

157
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,329
But he was so restless.

158
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,228
Are you a doctor?

159
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,378
- A vet.
- A vet?

160
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:27,432
Well, I only deal with animals and beasts.

161
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,423
Anyway, after a good night's sleep,

162
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:34,697
he suddenly claims
he has this scar on his leg.

163
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,305
There is this thing called
"attachment disorder."

164
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:45,770
When you're neglected and unloved
by your mother as an infant...

165
00:13:50,675 --> 00:13:54,672
Are you saying that my boy has a disorder?

166
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:56,306
I'm not saying that.

167
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,771
I'm not a doctor,

168
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,509
and Kyu-tae is not an animal.

169
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,301
So you mean,

170
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,129
what Mom's doing is...

171
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,177
some sort of hypnotizing?

172
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,801
"Hypnotizing"? More like torturing.

173
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,970
You're both right, and both wrong.

174
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:18,742
They may seem similar,
yet completely different.

175
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,750
It's called "a brain hacking."

176
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:25,501
It's a highly-advanced
interrogation technique, you know?

177
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,388
You completely dominate
a person's brain, spirit, and mind.

178
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:33,328
And even take over
the person's memory completely.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,217
It's hard-core stuff!

180
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,378
So that bastard doesn't remember anything
that happened yesterday?

181
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:42,608
Depends on what Mom wants.

182
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:46,762
Fabrication, distortion, even erasing.

183
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,482
Anything's possible.

184
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,099
She can erase his memory completely

185
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:54,060
or make it last forever.

186
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,046
Wow.

187
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,236
Seriously?

188
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,190
How is that even possible?

189
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,106
Come on.

190
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,986
You remember vividly
what you saw yesterday, don't you?

191
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,406
If not for this video,
you would have lived with that memory!

192
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,740
Well...

193
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:09,700
What a relief, right?

194
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,035
Yeah.

195
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:15,192
What?

196
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:16,858
What do you mean, "a relief"?

197
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,705
It doesn't matter how you do it!

198
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:20,781
How did she do it?

199
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,544
We'll unravel this one at a time.

200
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:27,260
If we tell you everything at once,
you won't believe it or understand it.

201
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,600
Come on, Grandpa!

202
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,721
You're home. How did it go?

203
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:35,348
- Fine.
- Okay.

204
00:15:36,095 --> 00:15:37,594
It went well.

205
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:42,690
Did you show the kids the video?

206
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:44,105
Yes.

207
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,284
You'll be late.

208
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,086
You should go to school.

209
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:51,316
We'll talk about it later.

210
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,544
See you.

211
00:15:58,826 --> 00:15:59,900
Good job.

212
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:06,799
Off you go.

213
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:12,244
What are you going to do?

214
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,351
Isn't it obvious?

215
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,537
We get this guy Jae-gon and deal with him.

216
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,200
No, I mean that woman.

217
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,812
Come on, she's our mom, not "that woman."

218
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:22,716
She's not even our real fucking mom.

219
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,156
Hey, she raised us.
That makes her our mom.

220
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,214
Giving birth isn't everything.

221
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:33,976
Damn it.

222
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,499
Seriously though,
did you already know about it?

223
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,106
Yeah.

224
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:46,189
I remember seeing it when I was little.

225
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,512
Help!

226
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,672
Help me, please!

227
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,669
- Help me!
- You bitch!

228
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,624
Where do you think you're going?

229
00:16:56,707 --> 00:16:58,197
You bitch!

230
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,975
- Help!
- You want to die?

231
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:01,111
Come here!

232
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:08,511
Honey...

233
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,707
I didn't know it wasn't real,

234
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,600
and that it was some sort of hacking.

235
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:29,548
Whatever it is, I can't be like you
and act like it's nothing.

236
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,209
Dude, what is your problem?

237
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,590
Why are you always so mean to mom?

238
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,439
She pisses me off, that's why!

239
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,896
What kind of a messed up family
keeps us from having a yearbook,

240
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,148
let alone a family photo?

241
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:48,036
Photographs are overrated.

242
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:49,883
The way I see it,

243
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:53,090
you're just looking for reasons
to hate Mom.

244
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:54,324
"Reasons"?

245
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:58,350
You saw her face was blank
like a corpse, doing all that crazy shit.

246
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,956
Whenever I see that face...

247
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,929
This is why I'm always angry.

248
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,455
Anyway, you're on your own
with your problems.

249
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,191
And I'll...

250
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:15,596
deal with my own problems.

251
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,726
JENITH HOTEL

252
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,129
CONVENIENCE STORE, MOTEL

253
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:31,805
Hello, everyone.

254
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:34,752
It's our grand opening
and you're all invited!

255
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:35,965
Shinara Night Club.

256
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,040
GRAND RE-OPENING SALE
Come on inside!

257
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,342
We're giving out flyers over there.

258
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,501
Get your gifts and come on in!

259
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,980
"Hard liquor"?

260
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,897
SHINARA NIGHT CLUB

261
00:19:05,497 --> 00:19:06,620
Excuse me, Pastor.

262
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:08,298
Listen...

263
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,359
You don't think Sister Lee's disappearance
is related to those cases

264
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,050
making the city consider canceling
development plans.

265
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:16,705
Pardon? What do you mean?

266
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:19,089
You know, the Doom-veloper.

267
00:19:20,386 --> 00:19:22,573
That psycho serial killer.

268
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,326
I wonder if she...

269
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:28,103
You know, I was just scared for her.

270
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,262
Oh, I'm...

271
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,672
I'm sorry, Pastor.

272
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,647
- Deacon Joe.
- Yes.

273
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:37,229
You must be busy
with your worldly business affairs.

274
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:41,626
Well, something came up
with my son yesterday--

275
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,834
What about Kyu-tae?

276
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,867
I mean, did something happen to your son?

277
00:19:52,556 --> 00:19:54,185
He's not feeling so well.

278
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:56,569
So he's resting at home.

279
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:00,709
Both your son and Sister Lee Yu-jin

280
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,577
are children of Christ and our family.

281
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,426
- Amen.
- I know you feel the same way

282
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:07,917
so pray for her a lot.

283
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,506
Amen. Yes, I should pray.

284
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:12,251
I'll pray, Pastor.

285
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,657
Where are you going?

286
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,975
The Pastor's dog is sick
and it's in the animal hospital.

287
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,110
"Animal hospital"?

288
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:22,963
- The new one in town?
- Yeah.

289
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,383
GRAND OPENING
FREE CHECK-UP

290
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,865
Hey, come on in, Pastor.

291
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,508
You're also here, Chief Oh.

292
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,999
It's the first time I see the missus.

293
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:52,209
You look too young to be a mother!

294
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:56,478
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Gil-ja,
the Deaconess of Aspirations Church.

295
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:57,757
Okay.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
My hands are filthy.

297
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,055
My hands are not so clean themselves.

298
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:09,410
I understand, I've had lots of dogs.

299
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:13,872
You're a shy one, aren't you?
Just like a cat.

300
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,405
I can fix you right away.

301
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:22,031
Well, how is Simbok?

302
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:24,957
He's a lot better now,
but feeling a bit low today--

303
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,981
- Hey, he must be here!
- Chief Oh, not that way!

304
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,650
- Here!
- You can't go in there!

305
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:32,033
Come on, here.

306
00:21:46,437 --> 00:21:48,411
Looks much better than before.

307
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:51,823
I'm talking about Simbok.

308
00:21:52,189 --> 00:21:55,318
Still, he should stay here a few more days
until he fully recovers.

309
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,108
His wounds run pretty deep.

310
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,397
"His wounds"?

311
00:22:01,143 --> 00:22:03,524
You mean he's wounded, not sick?

312
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,108
He has many wounds.

313
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:07,344
You didn't know?

314
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,230
So this must be the cage.

315
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,020
Yes.

316
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:16,601
God, this is all rusty!

317
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:18,757
It's so unsanitary!

318
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,583
- Why would you cover it?
- Don't.

319
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,771
- No, it's not like that.
- Then what is it?

320
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,945
No, that's...

321
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,469
Yes, I mean...

322
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:28,963
Yeah.

323
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:36,909
Last night, Kyu-tae went to that house
and came out all messed up.

324
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:38,948
Hold on.

325
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:42,264
Are you mistreating them or something?

326
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:43,612
What did you say?

327
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,873
I've raised them myself, I'd know!

328
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:47,955
Did you lock up the innocent ones

329
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:49,789
- Come on.
- and abuse them?

330
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:52,509
It's a hospital for the animals.
We'd never do that!

331
00:22:52,592 --> 00:22:54,637
Then let me see! Let me see in there!

332
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,417
- No, no, please.
- Let me see!

333
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:04,550
What is this?

334
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,426
It's empty.

335
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,269
It is.

336
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:09,874
It is empty.

337
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:11,722
But why?

338
00:23:15,614 --> 00:23:16,490
Oh.

339
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,996
Pastor, my gosh.

340
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:20,576
Oh, dear.

341
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:32,214
Anyway, I'm relieved
to see Simbok feeling better.

342
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:36,175
I trust he's in good hands,
until he is healed.

343
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:42,391
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

344
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,714
"Pawfect Haven"?

345
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,857
Pawfect, Haven...

346
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:48,819
It's more like hazard.

347
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:50,957
Oh, right.

348
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:54,607
Didn't you say you have twins?
What are the kids like?

349
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,298
"The kids"? Oh, you mean our kids?

350
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,897
I guess they're just typical kids.

351
00:24:00,183 --> 00:24:01,122
Right.

352
00:24:01,623 --> 00:24:02,816
They must be trouble.

353
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:07,306
Send them to our church study club.
I'll turn them into model students.

354
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:09,998
No kid is born compliant!

355
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,663
- They need discipline--
- Excuse me?

356
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,369
My kids,

357
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:17,383
they were born good.

358
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,093
Okay, sure.

359
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,149
Well then.

360
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:27,466
But being good is not enough.

361
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:29,594
They should contribute to the household.

362
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,287
Whoa, my heart almost dropped.

363
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,646
So did you take care of him
and let him out last night?

364
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,475
No, I didn't.

365
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:47,498
You didn't?

366
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:50,091
Then what? Did he run away?

367
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:03,405
Yeong-su, should we pack up?

368
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,878
He'll call the police.

369
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,018
If he wanted to, he would have already.
And the police would be here.

370
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:10,779
He didn't run away, he was let out.

371
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,325
"Let out"? By whom?

372
00:25:13,008 --> 00:25:14,037
Who else?

373
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:16,239
It's either Ji-hoon or Ji-woo.

374
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:23,868
I can't get a hold of Kyu-tae.

375
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:35,298
What happened to Fuc Kyu-tae?

376
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:37,025
Is he okay?

377
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,552
After everything he's done to you,
you worry about that jerk, not me?

378
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:43,648
Do you like him?

379
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:45,891
Sorry!

380
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,618
Sorry, that was a reflex.

381
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,398
Fine.

382
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:53,072
Let's be a couple.

383
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,355
- Starting today.
- What?

384
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:56,680
Start what?

385
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:59,570
Since you like me,
I'll try to like you too.

386
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,250
You're nuts.

387
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,282
I thought you were a loser
but you're a psycho.

388
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:05,509
Look.

389
00:26:05,593 --> 00:26:08,970
It's impossible to delete all the pictures
but I hid them.

390
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:13,530
I planted a malware in there.
If anyone finds it...

391
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:16,231
- It will blow up their accounts.
- Really?

392
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,993
You're not a psycho, you're a genius!

393
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,425
As for Kyu-tae, my mom took care of him.

394
00:26:28,248 --> 00:26:30,142
No, she treated him, so don't worry.

395
00:26:30,571 --> 00:26:31,589
"Treated"?

396
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:34,825
My mom's a vet. We run an animal hospital.

397
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,787
You said he was an animal.

398
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:44,548
Wow, I see now why you liked this school.

399
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,493
What is this? New love blossoming?

400
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:51,428
Hey, Ji-woo. I'm Min-jung, Kwon Min-jung.

401
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:52,873
Hope we can be friends.

402
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:54,662
Whatever.

403
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,063
What?

404
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:01,324
- You want your legs broken this time?
- No, not that.

405
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:03,384
The president wants to see you.

406
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:21,052
Baek Ji-woo!

407
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:23,946
- I heard you topped Kyu-tae.
- "Topped"?

408
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,587
That's lame.

409
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,755
Are you a gangster wannabe?

410
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:31,515
I was getting annoyed with him.
He was stepping over the line.

411
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,995
So thank you for taking care of him.

412
00:27:37,512 --> 00:27:38,507
Take this.

413
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,164
It's a reward for your hard work.

414
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:49,213
I opened up an account under your name
in the cryptocurrency exchange.

415
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,793
Run a tight ship around here,

416
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:56,258
you'll get a fixed income
every month, like clockwork.

417
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:57,918
So you're saying,

418
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:01,548
you're the real boss who owns the school.

419
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:04,185
And I'm just a paid worker?

420
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,225
Nah.

421
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:08,031
You'd be the official top dog
of the school.

422
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:11,744
I'm just someone
who handles the operations here.

423
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:14,997
A manager, if you will.

424
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,292
Whatever.
Your family must be well-connected.

425
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:21,739
Not well-connected.

426
00:28:23,304 --> 00:28:24,950
Just on another level.

427
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:27,483
What?

428
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,771
- You don't want this?
- Come on!

429
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:33,896
Who would say "no" to money?

430
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:38,264
Just do it.
It'll be nice to make some cash.

431
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:45,560
Don't mess up.

432
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:55,104
I thought he was just a jackass
but he's a class-A jackass.

433
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:58,367
It's for the better.

434
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,833
I was worried
he might be some small-time punk.

435
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:02,836
Now what?

436
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,006
Isn't it obvious?

437
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,785
I'll get rid of him.

438
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:13,116
And take complete control
over this school.

439
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,886
Dude.

440
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:21,263
Drop the psychopath act.
That's so fucking lame.

441
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:27,202
What do you mean, "act"?

442
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,654
KUMSUAK MOUNTAIN TRAILS

443
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,941
I'm at Kumsu-ro.
What about the vehicle search?

444
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:06,355
No need. We picked up the suspect
from the security cameras.

445
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,397
Lee Dong-min.

446
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,399
KUMSU-RO TRAIL SECURITY CAMERA

447
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:22,170
It's you, right?

448
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:26,079
Hey!

449
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,918
Dong-min, your shoelaces are loose.
Let's tie them up first.

450
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:47,966
So tell me, buddy.
Do you know how to drive?

451
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:49,544
You own a vehicle?

452
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:51,437
"A vehicle"?

453
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:52,997
No.

454
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:56,794
I failed. The driving test.

455
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:00,320
Ah, I see.

456
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:07,087
Then tell me, did you follow this girl
up in the mountain?

457
00:31:09,445 --> 00:31:10,416
Yeah.

458
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,549
Excuse me.

459
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:14,967
Phone.

460
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:17,419
Phone.

461
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:19,482
You... your phone.

462
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,796
Your phone!

463
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:22,929
I tried to pick up her phone for her.

464
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:26,384
I've been waiting for you, Yu-jin.

465
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,115
Huh?

466
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,986
Let's go. I'll walk you to your house.

467
00:31:39,174 --> 00:31:40,041
Wait.

468
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:44,662
What did you say her boyfriend called her?

469
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,597

GACHEON CITY, APARTMENT STAIRS

472
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:24,612
I've been waiting for you, Yu-jin.

473
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,917
Thank you.

474
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:35,318
But how did you guess my name correctly?

475
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,012
What a coincidence.

476
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,855
There's no such thing as coincidence.

477
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:47,137
Excuse me?

478
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:13,649
Those fucking bastards.

479
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:29,170
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

480
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,538
It was you, right?

481
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:50,452
What are you talking about?
Whatever it was, it's not me.

482
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:53,262
Then was it you, Ji-hoon?
Did you let him out?

483
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:55,405
Let who out?

484
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:58,233
Then it must be you, Ji-woo.
Who else can it be?

485
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,209
Don't accuse me out of the blue!

486
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,230
Enough!

487
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,443
Look at you guys.

488
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,851
The lack of communication is serious.

489
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,526
And we call ourselves a family?

490
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:12,754
Okay, starting now...

491
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,153
You each get to ask only one question.

492
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,100
First, Ji-woo.

493
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:21,851
What are you?

494
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:24,020
Where did you learn such horrible skills?

495
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:25,676
And why would you do this?

496
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:30,051
Grandpa said
you each get to ask one question.

497
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:32,860
So choose between "Where" and "Why."

498
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:34,088
Huh?

499
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:35,994
"Why"?

500
00:34:36,662 --> 00:34:38,334
To keep you safe.

501
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:40,411
What? Give me a break.

502
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:42,409
- I never asked you to do that!
- Okay.

503
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:44,040
Next up, Ji-hoon.

504
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:47,819
Can I learn how to do that?

505
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,325
No, only your mom can do it.

506
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:51,747
Next, Chul-hee.

507
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:54,678
Ji-woo, you really didn't let that man go?

508
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:56,748
Let who go? What are you talking about?

509
00:34:58,592 --> 00:35:00,307
Wait, he got away?

510
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,332
So it's not Ji-woo!

511
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:03,950
Next, Yeong-su.

512
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:06,462
Huh? Well...

513
00:35:06,545 --> 00:35:07,901
- Um...
- Was that a question?

514
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:12,105
No, I'll just let Ji-woo have my question.

515
00:35:12,613 --> 00:35:13,575
Really?

516
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,524
Okay, Ji-woo. Ask another one.

517
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:19,576
What exactly are you?

518
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,811
ONE MIND

519
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:54,918
I was maybe five or six?

520
00:35:57,186 --> 00:35:59,511
I'm not exactly sure, but...

521
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:04,273
ever since I was little,
I was taken away to Special Trainings

522
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:06,667
where I had special trainings.

523
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,755
"Trainings"?

524
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:10,708
You mean you were soldiers?

525
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:13,671
At the beginning,
we started off as soldiers.

526
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:15,997
But as time passed...

527
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:20,278
we were passed around
intelligence agencies, from KCIA to ANSP.

528
00:36:21,022 --> 00:36:22,208
And even that stopped

529
00:36:23,065 --> 00:36:25,979
when Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il died...

530
00:36:26,062 --> 00:36:29,439
Spies, Fixers, Technicians,

531
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,232
we were called many things,
but never had an official name.

532
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:35,913
"A Fixer"? What did you fix?

533
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:39,823
We got answers
from people we need answers.

534
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,274
And we caused pain...

535
00:36:44,508 --> 00:36:46,139
to those who deserve it.

536
00:36:48,055 --> 00:36:49,243
But your mom,

537
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,665
she was determined
not to let you kids have the life she had.

538
00:36:56,344 --> 00:37:00,551
So when she was just about your age,
she carried you on her back and escaped.

539
00:37:01,063 --> 00:37:02,967
Risking her own life.

540
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,827
Us?

541
00:37:08,337 --> 00:37:10,310
For whatever reason,

542
00:37:10,892 --> 00:37:12,305
unlike us,

543
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,593
you were put in that place as infants.

544
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,663
Young-hee!

545
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,366
Young-hee, are you okay?

546
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:33,519
I'm okay.

547
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:35,977
Let's get you up.

548
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:43,601
Young-hee.

549
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,873
I think something went wrong
with my father.

550
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:51,865
You go ahead.

551
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:55,234
Chul-su!

552
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,320
Don't go.

553
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,279
I promised you.

554
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:04,327
I'll keep you safe from harm's way,
until the end.

555
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:31,310
I will...

556
00:38:32,565 --> 00:38:37,400
No, Mommy will go get Daddy.
Wait here just for a moment.

557
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:39,518
Don't worry.

558
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:42,070
I'll keep you safe from harm's way,
until the end.

559
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:45,267
I promise you.

560
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:48,173
Because I'm your mom.

561
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:52,914
So you're saying

562
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:56,188
we all escaped from that place

563
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,117
and now we're on the run?

564
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,596
We couldn't use smartphones, social media,

565
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,327
and couldn't even take pictures,

566
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:06,997
because we were on the lam?

567
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:08,915
Because they might catch us?

568
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:11,233
- But that's--
- Yes, you're right.

569
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,177
It's all my fault.

570
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,416
I'm sorry.

571
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:18,860
You're "sorry"?
They should be thanking you.

572
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:21,240
Okay, now it's my turn.

573
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:26,537
What is important for this family now
is the present, not the past.

574
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:28,241
That guy.

575
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,217
Whether he escaped, or was let out,

576
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,540
every member of this family

577
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,746
should band together
and put our heads together.

578
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,408
We should be of one mind and fix this.

579
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:48,602
Hello?

580
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:50,701
- It's me.
- Who is this?

581
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,803
Damn it, it's me.

582
00:39:52,886 --> 00:39:54,243
"Me," who?

583
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:58,104
The one who you beat up,
dragged and caged like a dog.

584
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,688
Don't tell me,
you forgot my voice already?

585
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:03,063
How can I?

586
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:06,060
Tell me though, how did you get out?

587
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:08,198
Do you really think that matters?

588
00:40:09,122 --> 00:40:10,660
What really matters is,

589
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:14,434
that I saw everything your wife did.

590
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:16,750
What are you talking about?

591
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,700
And you think I just saw it?

592
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:22,216
I put everything on video, as evidence.

593
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,760
You put it on video?

594
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,434
Then you'll see.

595
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,458
What is this?

596
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:33,846
What? It can't be.

597
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:35,035
- What?
- What else?

598
00:40:35,118 --> 00:40:37,020
- You call it as you see it.
- Shut up!

599
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,612
I filmed how you locked me up in there!

600
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:46,335
Anyway, wait until I pay you back
for what you did.

601
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:49,090
First, check out my gift for you.

602
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:51,220
And call me at this number.

603
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:12,986
What is this?

604
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,240
You were right about your feeling.

605
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:19,095
Thank god he was more than a jerk
who's all talk.

606
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:20,762
"Thank god"?

607
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,609
Yeong-su, how can you say that
in a situation like this?

608
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:26,981
Now do you know who I am?

609
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,789
SEVENTH, SHIN JI-EUN
DEC 7TH, 2021

610
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:30,916
Shaking in your boots?

611
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:32,615
No.

612
00:41:33,189 --> 00:41:35,490
- So who are you again?
- What?

613
00:41:36,192 --> 00:41:37,969
You still don't get it?

614
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:41,540
Do you know how many fan clubs
and followers I have?

615
00:41:42,337 --> 00:41:44,394
SERIAL KILLER KILLS NINE VICTIMS SO FAR

616
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:47,778
"The serial killer
who killed nine victims so far."

617
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:50,460
No, make it ten now.

618
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:52,300
A.k.a. the Doom-veloper.

619
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:54,560
That's me.

620
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:56,403
You're saying you're the Doom-veloper?

621
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,657
No way, you can't be him.

622
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,047
Hello?

623
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:04,841
"No way"?

624
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,345
What's with that random reaction?

625
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:25,192
I mean, this is his style alright.

626
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,081
But neither the body

627
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,963
nor that bastard

628
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,174
had a marker on them.

629
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,833
Whatever he is,
he won't be able to call the police.

630
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:35,261
So that's a relief.

631
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:37,879
I guess you're right.

632
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:42,144
But, what do we do with her?

633
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,110
We can't just hide things from the kids
from now on.

634
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:47,903
Like Father said,

635
00:42:47,986 --> 00:42:51,363
we should band as a family
and put our heads together.

636
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,041
What are we even waiting for?

637
00:43:02,124 --> 00:43:04,098
We should call the cops right now!

638
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:07,333
And then what? Tell them we locked him up?

639
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,267
So why did you lock up an innocent...

640
00:43:10,105 --> 00:43:11,966
Wait, he was fucking guilty.

641
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,434
Baek Ji-woo! Language!

642
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:18,353
What should we do?

643
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:22,033
We can't just leave
a dead person out there.

644
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:37,557
Grandpa.

645
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:40,562
We're cleaning
traces of the murderer as well.

646
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:41,644
What can I say?

647
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:45,620
Forget about that guy.
Focus on the poor victim and us.

648
00:43:45,704 --> 00:43:46,582
Go now.

649
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,103
Oh, no.

650
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,197
- The car won't start?
- No.

651
00:44:00,384 --> 00:44:02,079
Darn it.

652
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:06,257
Should we call the tow truck, then?

653
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:11,499
What, and let the whole neighborhood know?

654
00:44:12,134 --> 00:44:14,666
Forget it, we should all push this car.

655
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:16,207
Push this car?

656
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,400
All of us?

657
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:20,329
No, not the kids.

658
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,349
Why not? We're part of this family.
We should all come together.

659
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:28,454
That's right.
We're not doing anything wrong.

660
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:33,506
Don't worry, I got every location
of the security cameras covered.

661
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,238
I hid an ace in the hole
for an emergency like this.

662
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:47,351
Get to your positions!

663
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,633
Yes, sir!

664
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:12,050
Come on, why does it have to rain now?

665
00:45:12,638 --> 00:45:15,599
I'm soaking wet in a dog costume.
All thanks to you, Father!

666
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:18,896
I told you,
we should have called the police!

667
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:23,219
You know what they say,
no good deed goes unpunished.

668
00:45:23,302 --> 00:45:25,170
This costume isn't waterproof.

669
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:32,279
Wait!

670
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:39,860
What now?

671
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,787
Open the trunk.

672
00:45:42,396 --> 00:45:44,198
The trunk? Why?

673
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:45,642
Jeez.

674
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,749
Her life was tragically cut short.

675
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:58,539
She should feel a little more comfortable

676
00:45:59,021 --> 00:46:00,832
before she leaves this world.

677
00:46:41,913 --> 00:46:45,823
KUMSU PRECINCT

678
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,931
What is this?

679
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,068
SHE IS A POOR VICTIM OF MURDER
PLEASE RETURN HER TO HER FAMILY

680
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:08,533
Twenty-six-year-old Ms. Lee
has gone missing

681
00:47:08,616 --> 00:47:11,629
from Kumsuak Mountain Trails
since the 15th,

682
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,871
and her body was found today.

683
00:47:13,954 --> 00:47:17,493
People saw
the poor victim's family in sorrow,

684
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:20,780
and found consolation in the fact
at least her body is found.

685
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:25,160
But at the same time felt outraged
at the perpetrators' deviant behavior,

686
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:29,383
taking the body to the police station
in funny costumes, putting on a show.

687
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:31,889
Those people are idiots.

688
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:34,435
Not the sharpest tool in the shed!

689
00:47:34,724 --> 00:47:37,686
What kind of a crazy person
would kill someone

690
00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:39,749
and take her body to the police station?

691
00:47:39,832 --> 00:47:41,760
If you finished breakfast, get going.

692
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:49,138
See you later.

693
00:48:30,972 --> 00:48:32,027
You see?

694
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,947
See how nice it is
when the family comes together.

695
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:39,367
Alright.

696
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:41,990
Nothing's going to happen.

697
00:48:43,663 --> 00:48:44,670
Why?

698
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:47,757
I thought you wanted something to happen.

699
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,050
Huh?

700
00:48:49,656 --> 00:48:51,232
What do you mean?

701
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:55,138
Ji-hoon didn't let the guy go, you did.

702
00:49:02,403 --> 00:49:03,889
You half-witted fool.

703
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,948
Why would you be so clumsy?

704
00:49:07,934 --> 00:49:09,422
Leave before sunrise.

705
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:48,173
