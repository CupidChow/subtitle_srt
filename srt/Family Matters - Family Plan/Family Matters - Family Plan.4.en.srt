1
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:24,858
Chul-su!

2
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,568
Don't worry, Young-hee.

3
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,238
I'll keep you safe from harm's way,
until the end.

4
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,561
TWO YEARS AGO

5
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,189
Are you done now?

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,357
Sorry.

7
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,614
I thought I was fine for a while.

8
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,370
It's okay.

9
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,665
I was having the same nightmare
so I'm glad you woke me up.

10
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,126
You were?

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,089
You said you don't remember much
about that place

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,132
so I thought you got better.

13
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,052
They're not completely erased.

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,515
Have you ever regretted it?

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,184
Running away from there?

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,895
No, never.

17
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,566
What about you?

18
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,236
Once.

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,948
Back when Ji-woo went missing.

20
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,832
<i>Going up and down.</i>

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>You're wondering what that is, aren't you?</i>

22
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:12,424
<i>You see, when you look from the outside,</i>
<i>it looks so much fun.</i>

23
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,344
<i>But when you're actually on the ride,</i>
<i>it feels terrible.</i>

24
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,405
<i>Did Mom send out men after us?</i>

25
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,324
<i>Has Ji-woo been kidnapped?</i>

26
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>In that split second,</i>
<i>I felt fear for the first time.</i>

27
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,927
<i>It felt like the sky was falling</i>
<i>and the whole world was turning to ruins.</i>

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,906
FAMILY MATTERS

29
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>Attention.</i>

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,843
What the hell is this?

31
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,181
What are you doing to me?

32
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,891
"Jang No-won"?

33
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,143
So, you're a city official?

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,604
What's this?

35
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,863
What does it say? "Aspirations Church"?

36
00:03:58,947 --> 00:03:59,823
Shit.

37
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,076
Unbelievable.
Some kind of Christian you are.

38
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,913
That's right, I'm a church elder.
So hurry up and take these off!

39
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,457
You bitch and bastard!

40
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,043
What are you doing over there, huh?

41
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,964
Excuse me,
I think there's a misunderstanding.

42
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,174
I don't know what they told you about me,

43
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,385
but don't believe a word
those bastards say!

44
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,097
You look like a decent person.
Come on, just take these off already!

45
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,432
We can talk about this.

46
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,644
Whatever you're imagining,
it's going to be much worse.

47
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,147
So watch closely.

48
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,108
Attention!

49
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,197
From here on out...

50
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,992
I'm going to be

51
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,619
a bit rough on you.

52
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,707
If anyone thinks it's unfair, step up now.

53
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,127
I'll even let you take the first swing.

54
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,964
Since when do thugs hit civilians?

55
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,049
You shit!

56
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,802
You'll be broken and smashed,
and it'll hurt like hell.

57
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,263
But don't worry too much.

58
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,726
Seriously?

59
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,730
I'll only use one hand.

60
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,859
It may not be fair, but I won't kill you!

61
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,703
Damn it, give me that.

62
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,791
Boss!

63
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,003
What the hell are you standing around for?

64
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,630
Just kill him!

65
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,839
Take him down!

66
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,758
You son of a bitch!

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,980
Damn it!

68
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,681
Honestly, I'd rather work on you
in reality.

69
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,855
Feel free to scream louder.

70
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,567
The more you do,
the longer the nightmare will haunt you.

71
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,985
Shit!

72
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,532
Please, don't kill me.

73
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,784
Of course, you're going to live.

74
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:54,497
You're going to live a long, painful life
with these terrible memories.

75
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,251
so they can finally
get some closure and peace.

76
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,212
What are you doing to me? Shit!

77
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,548
I am so sorry.

78
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,009
I wasn't a bad person, you know.

79
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,178
Sure, I know.

80
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,724
First, I'll start with amputating
your right wrist.

81
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,146
I'll cut just above the wrist bone,
so you can still use your forearm.

82
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,606
Then...

83
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,400
- Ju-kyung?
- Yes?

84
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,111
My father suggested
cutting his man part off

85
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,781
followed by oral insertion.

86
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,115
- No.
- Any thoughts?

87
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,825
No, no.

88
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,287
Please...

89
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,791
You heard her? After that,

90
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,418
the final step is
the enucleation of an eye.

91
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,711
What the fuck?

92
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,046
Why the hell!

93
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,548
- Why are you doing this to me?
- "Why"?

94
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,217
Let's see.

95
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,470
Your hands and eyes did bad things,
so you won't need both.

96
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,264
Wait, you only have one man part.

97
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,769
Don't worry, I'll cut it out real nice.

98
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,313
You bitches! I'll--

99
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,529
Open your mouth one more time
and I'll start with your tongue.

100
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,122
Fuck! Let me go!

101
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,540
Fuck.

102
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,042
Hey.

103
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,714
Enough.

104
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,382
"Enough"? Hell, no!

105
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,468
The girl's got nothing to do with this.

106
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,178
And what about my son?

107
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,847
What did he ever do

108
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,351
that you had to destroy
a perfectly healthy boy, you bastard?

109
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,894
Forget it.

110
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,355
Now this poor kid will pay the price

111
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,608
instead of your goddamn daughter.

112
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,695
Ji-hoon.

113
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,699
If you or your friend ever get hurt,

114
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,036
you know I'm going to be
in so much trouble with Mom, right?

115
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,747
I guess?

116
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:41,956
Yeah.

117
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,127
But it's more important for me
to keep Mom safe

118
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,880
than keeping you safe, you know?

119
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,006
Damn it.

120
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,216
You understand, right?

121
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,760
I understand.

122
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,803
Good.

123
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:59,766
That's why
I've been secretly training you.

124
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,476
You get what I mean, don't you?

125
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,518
You okay?

126
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,604
I was before.

127
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,399
But it hurts more now.

128
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,507
Are you sure
it's okay to just walk away from this?

129
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,429
Just go home and watch this.
You'll feel better.

130
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,184
Although for him, hell has just begun.

131
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,813
And don't worry too much
about any videos he made.

132
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,024
My son will wipe them out completely.

133
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,778
"Your son"?

134
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,284
Meeting my family wasn't a coincidence.

#PAWFECT_HAVEN_ANIMAL_HOSPITAL

141
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:03,390
Ji-hoon is nothing like Ji-woo.
He doesn't know a thing about fighting.

142
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,559
But he's a total whiz with computers.

143
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,564
And I just got him
a state-of-the-art laptop.

144
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,278
Please thank your son for me.

145
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,281
Thank you so much.

146
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,200
Yes, thank you.

147
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,587
So, how did it go?

148
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,298
<i>I'll head over now and wrap things up.</i>

149
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,009
Wait for a moment.

- Hey!
- Grandpa!

151
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,524
Hey!

152
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,317
- Well done, everyone.
- It's alright.

153
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,196
Good job.
No one on their side got killed. Alright.

154
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,365
Honey, you did great. Thank you.

155
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,118
You all did a great job.

About Ju-kyung.

159
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,526
What got you so invested in her?

160
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,861
What?

161
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:45,075
You thanked me earlier
as if I helped solved your problem.

162
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,537
It's just... You know.

163
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,955
Lame.

164
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,875
You're such a terrible liar.

165
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,714
The truth is...

166
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,552
<i>She reminded me of you back then.</i>

167
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,545
Remember when you asked
if I ever regretted running from there?

168
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,423
You said you didn't.

169
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,092
No.

170
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,511
Honestly,

171
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,266
there are times I do regret it.

172
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,020
Actually, for me...

173
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,649
not everything was bad back then.

174
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,363
At least back there...

175
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,076
I got to protect you every day.

176
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,255

00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,236
Wow, they are so amazing.
What's the recipe?

183
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,779
I give it a chef's kiss.

184
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,239
Wow.

185
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,327
By the way,
did you mean what you said last night?

186
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,710
What?

187
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,087
About us catching that guy
and getting rid of him.

188
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,674
"Him," who?

189
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,844
Who else? The serial killer that got away.

190
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,224
I heard you last night.

191
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,811
No, that's not what I meant...

192
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,563
My baby.

193
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:08,611
I'll keep you safe from harm's way,
no matter what.

194
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,032
I promise.

195
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm going to catch that bastard
and get rid of him for good.

196
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,190
But what do you mean, "us"?

197
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,651
We caught him and lost him as a team.

198
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,945
So we should finish it as a team.

199
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,073
Now that you mention it,

200
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:58,953
for the past few days, we got together
like any tight family would.

201
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,248
And enjoyed breakfast together, you know?

202
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,334
That's all thanks to me.

203
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,628
Or thanks to that bastard, maybe?

204
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,298
Come on, we're in the middle
of something serious here.

205
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,926
I'm telling you,
it's all because of that guy.

206
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,804
Just enjoy your fried egg.

207
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,275
My man parts.

208
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,111
My man parts.

209
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,279
So you're going to quit your job?

210
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,326
Who have you been screwing around with?
You were gone for days.

211
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,413
Honey.

212
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,206
What the...

213
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,252
You've got to be kidding me.
Don't tell me you shit your pants.

214
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,054
You're really putting
on a damn freak show here.

215
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,682
A "damn show"? Are you kidding?

216
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,642
Look at this mess. How could you say that?

217
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,773
Right. I didn't see it properly.

218
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,235
You haven't shit your pants yet.
Now you're pissing yourself.

219
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,863
Shit.

220
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,453
Do you admit the charges?
A quick comment, please.

221
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,746
Stay back!

222
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,248
- Any words for the victims' families?
- Step back, please.

223
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,542
Do you admit the charges?

224
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,502
- What's your motive for murder?
- Back off!

225
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,047
Don't push, please! It's dangerous.

226
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,261
There's no way Dong-min did it!

227
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,975
What do you mean, "there's no way"?

228
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:48,021
Are you saying he's not Lee's killer
or he's not the Doom-veloper?

229
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,314
Neither.

230
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,066
Did he confess?

231
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,568
There's no murder weapon or evidence!

232
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,653
"Evidence"?

233
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:59,532
Well, do you have evidence
that he's not the culprit?

234
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,617
What?

235
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,703
He was at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

236
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,955
That's circumstantial evidence.

237
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,707
The circumstantial evidence!

238
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,795
The prosecutor investigates.

239
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,339
The judge decides.

240
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,842
And our job is to bring them in.
Isn't that what we're here for?

241
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,886
Bullshit.

242
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:24,683
So our job is to drag in
an innocent kid and pin it on him?

243
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,101
What did you just say?

244
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,187
I've had it with you. Listen.

245
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,023
Stop crossing the line, okay?

246
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,653
Let's say, on the off chance,
HQ thinks this is the Doom-veloper.

247
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,197
Then they'll come
tearing this place apart.

248
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,158
Are you ready
to take on the responsibility?

249
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,661
Damn it.

250
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,039
What a crazy idiot.

251
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,960
Jeong-hwan,
you've done everything you could.

252
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:58,008
A horse can't beat someone
holding the reins, okay?

253
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,015
LEE DONG-MIN

254
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,897
What's this bracelet?

255
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,734
I go to church now.

256
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,444
JOE "JELLYFISH"

257
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,076
CROSS PENDANT BRACELET

258
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,906
Going somewhere?

259
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,950
Yeah. Just going to meet someone.

260
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,912
Who do you even have to meet?

261
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,210
I do have someone.

262
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:28,765
It's definitely a guy, isn't it?

263
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,393
A guy? What kind of nonsense is that?

264
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,606
So it's fine for you to falter,
but she can't?

265
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,485
"Falter"? What do you mean by that?

266
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,322
Are you saying
she's cheating or something?

267
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,281
With who?

268
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:47,909
Getting all worked up, huh?

269
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,662
Does that even make sense?

270
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:56,960
You think she'd waste
any little feelings she has on cheating?

271
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,838
Right? I thought so.

272
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,927
You blockhead. You're so easy to fool.

273
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,304
It's not even fun.

274
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,683
But...

275
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,937
it does seem like she's up to something.

276
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,025
- Like what?
- What else?

277
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,485
Whatever it is,
it's probably for the family.

278
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:27,907
Father.

279
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,411
Let's go get that jerk.

280
00:23:32,704 --> 00:23:33,747
"That jerk"?

281
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,632
CRAZY ANIMAL HOSPITAL

282
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,384
Damn it!

283
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,597
<i>Is this The Loser?</i>

284
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,891
What? Who are you, bastard?

285
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,309
<i>"Bastard"?</i>

286
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:58,980
Guess I hit a nerve with the word "loser."
You know yourself well.

287
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:02,650
<i>You must be that old fart who let me go.</i>

288
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,612
"Old fart"? Why you little...

289
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:10,033
I am the one
holding your life by a thread!

290
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,584
IMAGE ATTACHED

291
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,337
<i>The good news is</i>

292
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:26,841
<i>we didn't hand this over to the police</i>
<i>when we brought them the car.</i>

293
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,302
<i>But the bad news is</i>

294
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:34,641
you and the victim's DNA are on it,
if not your fingerprints.

295
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,688
I guess letting you go

296
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,566
worked out for the better
for the most part.

297
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,193
But now--

298
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,861
<i>Are you calling the cops on me?</i>

299
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,739
That depends on you.

300
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,574
Who knows? Bring a fancy gift basket

301
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,827
<i>and beg for mercy. We might give it back.</i>

302
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,829
Stop playing games
and tell me what you want!

303
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,289
You shameless jerk.

304
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:02,377
No matter how desperate,
there's an order to things.

305
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,922
Who asks to wipe their ass
before they even take a shit?

306
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:11,845
How can you hang up like that?

307
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,347
What more is there to say?

308
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,142
He's desperate to take a shit.
He'll come to the toilet.

309
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,271
The fuck!

310
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,190
Fine.

311
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,528
Sneaking around isn't my style.

312
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,322
I'll go myself.

313
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,368
I will skin that old bastard alive.

314
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,663
And everyone else, even the nasty dog.

315
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,249
Because I'm Jung Ho-chul,

316
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,252
not Jung Ho-peless chump.

317
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,478
I've been waiting for you.

318
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,480
"Waiting"?

319
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,357
For me? Why?

320
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:10,612
Actually, I was going to reach out
to you first.

321
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,661
SUPPORT US TO BUILD THE CHURCH

322
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,767
You were going to reach out to me first?

323
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:42,394
What does that mean?

324
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,690
About Simbok.

325
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,776
As you already know,

326
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,782
Simbok went through some abuse.

327
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:02,580
Deaconess Oh and I have been caring
for children in need.

328
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,918
I've even adopted some of them.

329
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,295
One of them is Jae-gon.

330
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,424
PERSONAL INFORMATION

331
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,259
SCHOOL RECORDS

332
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,635
"Park Jae-gon."

333
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,431
- So Kyu-tae was telling the truth?
- Yeah.

334
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,643
Jae-gon sent the girls' social media IDs
to that city official.

335
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:28,356
And he got their information
from his office system and passed it back.

336
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,819
Then Jae-gon made
fake photos and videos for blackmail.

337
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,197
Simbok's not the only one.

338
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,908
There are more victims abused by him.

339
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,631
What is all this?

340
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,010
Elder Jang, and even Jae-gon?

341
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:02,599
Pastor, it seems like
you should take care of your son yourself.

342
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,394
As for that elder guy,
I handled him myself appropriately.

343
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,230
"Handled"?

344
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:14,611
Here. Makes me wonder
if people who attend this church

345
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,947
actually have any faith at all.

346
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,205
Every rotten person I've met here
wears one like this, so I got curious.

347
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,708
And I see you're wearing one, too.

348
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,003
This bracelet...

349
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:36,049
All our church members wear it.

350
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,595
The woman killed on Kumsuak Mountain
also went to your church, I guess.

351
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:43,807
Yes.

352
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,019
But I don't suppose
that serial killer on the news

353
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,188
is from your church, too?

354
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,774
A serial killer in our church?

355
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,194
No way. That's impossible.

356
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,029
Are you sure?

357
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:03,743
They say following the path of the cross
would lead you to heaven.

358
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:07,414
But this city...

359
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,375
It looks worse than hell.

360
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,145
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

361
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,354
Why do you cry?

362
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:37,318
You know, "Brain hacking."
You tear up every time you do it.

363
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,823
I don't know.

364
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,496
It causes others pain.

365
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,166
You think I should laugh instead?

366
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:55,211
I mean, they are bad people
and you're doing some good.

367
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:01,468
Whatever the reason or whoever it is,
pain is still pain.

368
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,011
The same goes for me.

369
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,014
Huh? Even to you?

370
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:11,644
The pain I inflict on them
all comes from my mind.

371
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:17,359
So whatever they feel,
I can't help but feel it, too.

372
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,611
You mean...

373
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,989
you've been feeling it all this time, too?

374
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,581
Do you remember what I said?

375
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,543
"There are bad consequences

376
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,879
<i>for bad actions."</i>

377
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:43,218
<i>So don't even think of becoming like me.</i>

378
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:28,972
CHANCE OF RAIN 80%

379
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,203
Ever since Fuc Kyu-tae vanished,
it's like every day's a party around here.

380
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,707
For sure!
The devil's finally gone from school.

381
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,752
I don't know.
The real devil is still out there.

382
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,796
Hey, you've been acting lame all day.

383
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,970
FATHER: PRAY
JAE-GON: YES

384
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,388
FATHER: YOU LET ME DOWN

385
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,187
Jae-gon!

386
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:20,565
Kyu-tae got kicked out of school
and shut down all his socials.

387
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,650
Why waste time worrying about the dead?

388
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,153
Focus on turning the fucking tables.

389
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,780
And those twins?

390
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:30,575
The weird thing is,
there's no trace of them on social media.

391
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,453
Not even a single picture
about where and how they lived.

392
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,373
No pictures?

393
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,252
Then we can take a nice picture of them.

394
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,714
Hell, make it a family picture.

395
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:51,971
Darn it.

396
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,393
Don't lean on me.

397
00:32:58,186 --> 00:32:59,521
Gently.

398
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,281
Where and how did you get hurt?

399
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,910
Well, it's not his body that's damaged.

400
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:16,830
It's his mind, Pastor.

401
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:36,057
Look at this, Pastor.
How does my hand look to you?

402
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,562
They look fine to me.

403
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,525
My hand was cut off.

404
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,527
My wrist was cut, too.

405
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,613
One of my eyes was gouged out.

406
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:53,658
And my man part was cut off, too.

407
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:54,659
No, it wasn't.

408
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:07,505
PERSONAL INFORMATION

409
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:08,590
SCHOOL RECORDS

410
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,468
What is all this?

411
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,140
Sorry, honey.

412
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,808
The truth is...

413
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,977
Don't ask for my forgiveness.

414
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:27,692
But ask for the Pastor's and God's.
Kneel and repent with all your heart.

415
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,195
Well...

416
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:38,995
Hallelujah.

417
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,706
Hallelujah, dear lord.

418
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:44,626
Please forgive my sins.

419
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,585
Don't tell me,

420
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:49,214
you're the one who hurt Sister Lee Yu-jin.

421
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:53,176
What? I'd never do something so terrible.

422
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,094
And those?

423
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:59,182
Are they less horrible
than taking a person's life?

424
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:03,061
Well, that's...

425
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,063
Pastor!

426
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:08,900
This man has Satan possessed
in his lower half

427
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,236
but he's not cut out to be a killer.

428
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,863
Besides, they caught the suspect.

429
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:15,782
No, they didn't.

430
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,993
The vet told me.

431
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,746
The killer could be someone
from our church.

432
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,624
- The vet?
- Didn't you know?

433
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,043
The one who handled...

434
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:32,465
No, the one who did this to him

435
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:34,843
was Han Young-su from the animal hospital.

436
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:45,103
Do you know what's worse than your sins,
Elder Jang?

437
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:46,855
Pardon?

438
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:50,525
That I haven't repented?

439
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,905
No? Well...

440
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,908
Wait, please...

441
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,251
That I never realized my own sins?

442
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:16,926
Or...

443
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:18,553
Well...

444
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,891
You betrayed your family's trust.

445
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,478
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

446
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:32,442
<i>About that night...</i>

447
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,694
Where were you coming from?

448
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,988
Our family was moving in here.

449
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:40,617
"Family"?

450
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:49,793
A family!

451
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,298
Hold on a second.

452
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,343
Let's see.

453
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:00,679
What?

454
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,347
What are you doing, Simbok?

455
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,683
What's wrong?

456
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:09,688
He's a Shepherd, right?

457
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,358
You scared me.

458
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,319
When did you...

459
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,071
Well...

460
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:21,324
I said hello,
but guess you didn't hear me. Sorry.

461
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,375
And what brings you here?

462
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,127
Well...

463
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,713
I was just passing by
and wanted to ask you something.

464
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,848
I was wondering
if you had seen this before.

465
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:47,142
It was found at the murder scene.

466
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,269
"Murder"?

467
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,229
No, never.

468
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,689
"Never"?

469
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,483
That's odd.

470
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,029
I thought I saw something like this
when I was here last time.

471
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,741
Take a closer look.

472
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:06,244
Look at you. So proud and handsome.

473
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,371
Come here, you.

474
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:13,585
Wait.

475
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,130
I found one.

476
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,259
But what's this on it?

477
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,937
Blood, maybe?

478
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,075
I trust you have been well, Mother.

479
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:47,577
"Mother"?
Trying to be her daughter-in-law?

480
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,246
Yes, Min-jung, good to see you.

481
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,707
What brings you to school?

482
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,002
I heard it's likely to rain later.

483
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,797
Nothing's wrong at home, right?

484
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:01,299
Nothing's wrong.

485
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,261
What could possibly go wrong at our home?

486
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:19,693
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I'm on my way to see you, lady.</i>

487
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:31,621
The fact that it's cut like this
suggests it was used in this place.

488
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,126
What did you tie up with this?

489
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,670
Or should I say, who?

490
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:40,422
What?

491
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:46,845
Besides your father and wife,
you have kids.

492
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:47,929
Two, right?

493
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,228
The body placed in front of the station.

494
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,981
That was your family's doing, wasn't it?

495
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,484
What are you talking about?

496
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,677
It's not a good time, just leave!

497
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:32,349
You seem pretty shaken up.

498
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:43,610
What? You had no problem
tying and locking me up.

499
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,488
Who tied and locked who up?

500
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:48,490
Who are you?

501
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:50,575
Oh, right.

502
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:52,660
I'm a detective.

503
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:54,537
You called the fucking cops on me?

504
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,247
No, come on.

505
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,166
Calm down.

506
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:02,379
You're right.
Whatever this is about, calm down.

507
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,215
Leave the poor dog out of it.

508
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:07,467
Animal cruelty is a serious offense.

509
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,094
Shut up!

510
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:13,765
Come any closer and I'll kill this mutt!

511
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:20,730
Don't be fooled by how small Tiger is.

512
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,691
He's got quite the bite.

513
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:24,984
What? "Tiger"?

514
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,152
Tiger, stand guard!

515
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,029
Attack!

516
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:49,676
Hey!

517
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,932
Okay, everyone take it easy.

518
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,227
Shut up!
I swear, I'll skin both of you alive.

519
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:19,998
The calf.

520
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,042
The chick.

521
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:23,835
The cat.

522
00:42:24,878 --> 00:42:26,046
The dog.

523
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:29,466
Then where's the monkey?

524
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:32,427
The monkey.

525
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,975
Have you ever seen
a monkey this good-looking?

526
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,274
What did you do that for?
You can't even fight.

527
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:47,776
Sorry.

528
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,196
I was just wondering
whether this might work.

529
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:52,697
Sorry.

530
00:42:58,078 --> 00:42:59,496
We caught him alright.

531
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,415
But it seems like
we have something else to worry about.

532
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:20,266
But...

533
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,268
Why?

534
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:24,354
Huh?

535
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:26,398
Oh, right.

536
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,443
You see, I have a life insurance policy
on this tool.

537
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,530
And it only pays a decent amount

538
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:37,492
if the cause of death was
an accidental injury, not an illness.

539
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:40,829
His body's a wreck.

540
00:43:41,746 --> 00:43:46,418
So he's useless now, good for nothing.

541
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:49,921
And the development project
was going nowhere.

542
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:52,340
So...

543
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,594
I figured he could be better used

544
00:43:57,345 --> 00:44:00,306
for building God's kingdom,
even if it's just a penny.

545
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:16,281
TWO YEARS AGO

546
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,132
- "Development zone killer."
- The killer.

547
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,967
Looks like the killer is someone
from Special Trainings.

548
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:40,555
"Special Trainings"?
Where did that come from?

549
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:44,684
"Under the victim's collarbone

550
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,103
was a Roman numeral seven."

551
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:50,023
What if this is a message from Mom?

552
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,484
To lure me out?

553
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:57,822
No way. That's impossible.

554
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:01,284
Gacheong City, Anhyeon City
and Yongjin City.

555
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:05,080
The murders all took place
in cities we used to live.

556
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:07,165
There's no way.

557
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,503
How can you be so sure?

558
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:13,672
What I'm saying is...

559
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:15,965
Not that it's possible,

560
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,344
but even if it were,
I'd hunt them down myself.

561
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,179
You have nothing to worry about.

562
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:31,564
If this has nothing to do with us,
you won't need to step in.

563
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,736
No matter how many people end up dead.

564
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:41,074
Nothing is more important
than Ji-hoon and Ji-woo.

565
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,409
