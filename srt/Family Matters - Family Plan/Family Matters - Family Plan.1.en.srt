Get up!

00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,707
You are all abandoned.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,502
Abandoned by your mom and dad
who spawned you,

11
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,005
and abandoned by the world.

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,176
No other family outside these walls
will embrace you.

13
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,483
From now on, this is your home
and I'm your mother.

14
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,782
Be quiet and listen carefully.

15
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,496
It's the sound of the children outside
dying every night,

16
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,581
who are abandoned like you.

17
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,251
So, don't even think about running away.

Not only it's impossible to escape,

but even if you do,

Listen.

00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,984
Please try not to draw any attention
at the new school.

00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,486
If the kids pick up a fight,

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,031
just think they're stressed
about going to college

37
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,033
now that they're in high school.

38
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,243

Like they're the only ones in high school

42
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,959
and they're in middle school.

- What I'm saying--
- What I'm saying is

45
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,382
you should wrap up your speech.

46
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,635
Or you can
just wrap the strings like I do.

47
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,730
Other parents would say
it's better than getting beaten up.

48
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,900
Yes, if you were other kids--

49
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,280
At the new school,

50
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,283
try to hold back as much as you can.

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,161
- Then--
- Then can I get a smartphone?

52
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,496
No, a laptop.

53
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,165
Lame. What are you, ten?

00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,793
Never mind that.

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,545
What if we can't take it anymore?

56
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,091
If you can't take it anymore...

57
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,094
Bring them home.

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,930
Mommy will take care of things.

59
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,059
Rather than you guys making a fuss,

60
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,353
it's better if I handle things.

00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,724
As if.

67
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,476
The only party I attended last night
was a pity party at the office,

68
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,728
and I'm about to drop.

69
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,563

- A new case.

No, it's not him!

You always bring that bastard up
even for a trivial case.

73
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,197
It's just a missing-person case.

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,033
Or it could be just a runaway.

75
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,035
Jeez.

00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,956
The missing person is Lee Yu-jin.
Age, 26.

last night,

early this morning

by a hiker walking
Kumsuak Mountain trails.

80
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,847
I think she spent the entire morning
searching the mountain

81
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,475
after getting the call
that we found her phone.

82
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,647
She confirmed the woman
to be her daughter,

I'll buy you a laptop,

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,121
so if anything ever happens at school,
you have to tell me, okay?

111
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,376
I'll get going.

- Well, you're also a--

00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,683
I told you to drop the mommy roleplay.

You're not even my real fucking mother.

118
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,701
So tell me.

119
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,122
Why did you come back to this town?

120
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,377
You've never stayed in the same place
for more than two years.

121
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,296
To hide your tracks from them,

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,548
you never bought them books
for a Facebook account

123
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,176
let alone a smartphone.

124
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,347
You don't need books
to create a Facebook account.

00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,642
What? You're totally clueless.

126
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,519
Why else would they call it Facebook then?

127
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,897
Anyway, the kids are growing up.

128
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,650
How much longer do you think
you can keep the secret?

129
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,319
Take yesterday's accident, for instance.

00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,864
No wonder Ji-woo is acting out like that.

131
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,828
Why don't you just sit down with Ji-woo
and settle things...

132
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,206
We can take this opportunity

133
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,334
to come clean to them
about the true nature of this family

134
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,046
and settle things together

What about the kids? They went to school?

140

I see Ji-woo was going at you again.

There's nothing wrong with them.

It's Chief Oh, Kumsu Realty.
Where's my commission?

00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,263
I wired it a moment ago.

Jeez, what the...

163
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,070
- The realtor?
- Yeah.

164
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,699
She always hangs up
after saying her piece.

165
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,741
What did she say?

166
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,746
Well, she says our landlord is a pastor

167
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,875
and he has this dog
which started biting...

168
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,043
Something like that.

169
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,837
Who bit who?

170
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,756
Hey, get him off!

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,466
Get him off!

172
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,344

You fucking bastard!

174
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,241
Stop, that's enough.
You're going to kill him.

I'm going to kill him!

176
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,203

We don't want to damage it
and return it, do we?

182
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,432
We should keep him
and have fun with him.

183
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,809
Am I right, buddy?

184
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,437
Gosh.

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,690
Sir, you've had a hell of a first day
getting your ass kicked.

186
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,151
Take all the rest you need, okay?

187
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:36,863
Let's go.

188
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,052
Strike the throat!

189
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,938
Is he just a lame loser?

190
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,282
Well, well.

191
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,204
We have a familiar face here.
I've seen your type before.

192
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,622
Pardon?

193
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,709
It's a Belgian Shepherd.

194
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,920
He looks fierce,
but is more gentle than you'd think.

195
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,341
Sure, you should not judge a man
by his appearances.

196
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,678
You look familiar,
so I thought I knew you from somewhere.

197
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,347
Oh, you were talking about me?

198
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,724
Can I help you?

199
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,642
Well...

200
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,062
I thought Deaconess Oh called you.

201
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,981
You must be the mighty landlord.

202
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,941
I've heard about you.

203
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,694
Landlord? No, it's not mine.

204
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:01,489
It's the church's asset,
a contribution to build a new holy church.

205
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,116
I see.

206
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,160
You're a man of god.

207
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,746
That's why you looked familiar.

208
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,123
So, is this our guy?

209
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,291
Yes.

210
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,626
It's been about a week

211
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,838
that he lost his appetite
and is feeling a bit low.

212
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,466
A few days ago,
he suddenly started biting.

213
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,603
And the name?

214
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,856
It's Yoon Myung-hwan.

215
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,401
No, I mean this little fellow.

216
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,196
Oh, I thought...

217
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,947
It's Simbok.

218
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:44,908
Symbol?

219
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,868
Does he symbolize you?

220
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,120
A pastor who herds a flock of sheep?

221
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,121
No, it's not.

222
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:54,209
It's "Simbok," and it means
"to be fulfilled with god's grace."

223
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:56,878
Excuse me.

224
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,133
Hallelujah, this is Pastor Yoon--

225
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,845
Pardon?

226
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,013
Who went missing?

227
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,723
Okay.

228
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,642
I see.

229
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,978
I'll head to the holy church right away.

230
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,855
Okay.

231
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,858
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
Something urgent came up at the church.

233
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,031
You can leave him here with us.
We'll take a look and call you.

234
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay. Please take good care of him.

235
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,332
But the room for the dog
is already occupied.

236
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,500
What do we do?

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,845
You should finish unpacking.
Where are you going?

238
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,388
You fool.

239
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,392
To fix that problem,
we have some preparation to do.

240
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,198
What are you doing?

241
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,118
Jeez, you scared me.

242
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,372
As you can see, I took your pictures.

243
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,210
Damn, look at that posture
and the expression!

244
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,921
This looks promising.

245
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,465
Delete it, or I'll kill you.

246
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,552
I heard you're a twin,
but you two are nothing alike.

247
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,307
I'll delete them on my own terms.

248
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,103
We should follow each other.

249
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,358
Holy shit.

250
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,026
This is an ancient phone!

251
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,904
- You're not on social media?
- I said, delete them.

252
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,242
Your mom must be
one hell of a helicopter mom.

253
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,370
So is my mom.

254
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,877
What a load of crap.

255
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,256
They say he beat up a bully so bad
that he got kicked out of the school,

256
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,258
so I thought he was the real deal.

257
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,843
It's such a cliche.

258
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,264
Why do we always have false rumors
about the new kids?

259
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,433
Damn, that loser.

260
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,310
But he's tough though.

261
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,731
Look what he did to his hand.

262
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:22,982
You loser.

263
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,905
You piece of shit.

264
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,241
Go back to your class.

265
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,745
Fuc Kyu-tae.

266
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,123
Don't cross the line, okay?

267
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,542
You got it, student president.

268
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,170
Hey.

269
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,215
I got dibs on you, so get excited.

270
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,722
Shit.

271
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,182
Another crappy town.

272
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,731
NO LITTERING
SECURITY CAMERA RECORDING

273
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,318
DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE LAUNCH

274
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,374
HARDWARE STORE
BOOKSTORE, PARKING LOT

275
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,652
- Go.
- Hey.

276
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,488
I'm at Lee Yu-jin's house,

277
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,781
and it's clean.

278
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,116
There are no signs of forced entry either.

279
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,703
Apparently, she's single

280
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,247
with no social life
apart from her family and church.

281
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,457
No boyfriend, huh?

282
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,960
So it boils down
to either kidnapping or murder.

283
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,338
Or she could be a runaway.

284
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,799
Lately, they say she was barely at home.

285
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,094
Hello?

286
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:15,762
Hello?

287
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,972
What the...

288
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,743
Man-joong,

289
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,829
it's the Doom-veloper.

290
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,456
You say that about everything!

291
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,666
I have to go.

292
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:20,493
So what?

293
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,079
So what? What about this?

294
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,457
It's a common cable tie anyone can use.

295
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,252
Not anyone trims the edges
in the urgent moment of murder.

296
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,213
You know it's his signature!

297
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,548
The Doom-veloper...

298
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,637
Is the body found?
You said there was only blood.

299
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,264
So we should find the body first.

300
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,391
- The commissioner ordered--
- Hey!

301
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,769
What if it's really him?

302
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,480
God damn it.

303
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,023
Why is he in our jurisdiction?

304
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,777
The bastard only kills
in development zones, a.k.a. Doom-veloper.

305
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,279
And they're putting off
development projects!

306
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,739
What if he kills before then?

307
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,451
Look, I'm going to catch this guy.

308
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,371
You?

309
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey, why are you so obsessed with him
when you're not cut out for this?

310
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,003
"Obsessed"? Because I'm a detective.

311
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,089
It's my job to catch the killer.

312
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:17,467
Forget about it.

313
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,721
Just try to keep your feet on the ground.

314
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,015
Fine.

315
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,518
That little...

316
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,436
KUMSU CITY'S DEVELOPMENT CANCELED?

317
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,105
Damn it.

318
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,692
"Kumsu mountain..."

KUMSU-RO TRAIL SECURITY CAMERA

320
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,494
I bet that bastard resurfaced
within the last few days.

321
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,872
Should I pull out the list
of people who recently moved in?

322
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,792
No, he's not likely to have
a permanent address.

323
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,338
He would need a vehicle
to dump the body.

324
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,968
It will be easier to locate the car
than to locate a man.

325
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,803
That's right.

326
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,723
The only road to enter the city
is Kumsu-ro.

327
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,890
Right.

328
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,802
KUMSU ASPIRATIONS CHURCH

329
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,054
My daughter Yu-jin

330
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,390
only went to the church and home.

331
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,516
You know that, Pastor.

332
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,643
Yes, of course.

333
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:51,770
I know.

334
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:55,815
With the serial killer
roaming the streets,

335
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,275
I'm worried sick.

336
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:03,365
Tonight, for Sister Lee Yu-jin's
safe return to the church,

337
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,117
we'll hold a special vigil.

338
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,204
- Deaconess Oh.
- Yes.

339
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:13,750
Please make sure
everyone at church attends the vigil.

340
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,002
Okay, Pastor.

341
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,633
What does the little shit want to do?

342
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:28,014
A special vigil praying
for the safe return of Sister Lee Yu-jin?

343
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,934
They say a chick from the church
went missing.

344
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,395
What do you mean, "missing"?

345
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,398
Wait.

346
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:38,858
You don't think

347
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,904
that fucking Doom-veloper had
something to do with this, do you?

348
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,155
Who knows?

349
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,285
Maybe she's one of the bitches you know.

350
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,537
Who, me?

351
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,330
Don't be ridiculous.

352
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,209
I only have eyes for you, you know that.

353
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,211
As if! A dog can't quit eating poop.

354
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,297
You had your nose dived in girls' fannies.

355
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,758
Jeez, look at you two lovebirds.

356
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,760
Shut it. What about you?

357
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,263
When will he sell the nightclub building?

358
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,597
I looked into the owner,

359
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:13,393
and he turned out to be a friend
of my former gang brother.

360
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,770
Friend, second cousin, doesn't mean shit.

361
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,147
You're chickening out?

362
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,189
The hell I am.

363
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,859
I'm just saying that
even thugs have an honor code.

364
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,193
An honor code, my ass.

365
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:24,904
If you stick to
all the codes of your earthly life,

366
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,823
how can you build the kingdom of god?

367
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,783
You can't. Hallelujah.

368
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,285
What fucking kingdom?

369
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,417
Because of some lunatic,

370
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,128
the development project
is about to be canceled.

371
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,256
No, Mr. Joe.

372
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,926
They're putting on a show
because of public outcry,

373
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,470
but it will die down.

374
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,013
Are you sure about that?

375
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,684
I can't trust your shitty intel
one little bit.

376
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,437
All you do is eat like a pig.

377
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,486
You were a fucking nobody,
a wobbly jellyfish.

378
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,988
Now you have a restaurant
too good for you

379
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,949
with a stingray you don't deserve

380
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,243
and everyone's calling you the boss.

381
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,747
Who do you have to thank for,
Mr. Fucking Joe?

382
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:20,272
Are you saying it's all thanks to you,
Oh "The Teeth" Gil-ja?

383
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,004
No way.

384
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:27,217
It's all thanks to our Jesus Christ!

385
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,637
Jesus is with you.

386
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,764
He's with every one of us.

387
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:37,686
So let us contribute to the cause
and raise funds to build the holy church!

388
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:38,812
- Amen!
- Amen!

389
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:42,857
Show our love
to the almighty Father in heaven!

390
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,567
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

391
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,528
Let us pray in gratitude!

392
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:51,324
Technically, it's thanks to the pastor
who does all the dirty work.

393
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,577
All we have to do is pray like crazy,

394
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,664
and the heaven is upon us.

395
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,292
Let's hold on to that, Hae-pal.
Okay, honey?

396
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,628
Holy shit.

397
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:10,719
If I didn't know better,
I'd thought you were a bible thumper!

398
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,054
Now hold on!

399
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:17,642
I've never told a lie in my life
which I didn't absolutely mean.

400
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,187
The arcade, the nightclub...

401
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,149
We bought those buildings
lying we'll build a holy church,

402
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,526
putting them all under our name.

403
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,903
If the development
actually happens, jackpot.

404
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:32,407
If not, we drop everything
and get the hell out of here.

405
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,285
What a beautiful Hallelujah it is!

406
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,912
- Hallelujah, Amen.
- Yes, Amen.

407
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,835
Honey.
It's not easy leeching off of someone.

408
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,713
But here, a simple lie can get you that.

409
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,132
The money comes in like clockwork!

410
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,594
Just bite the bullet and jerk them off.

411
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:55,722
It's not like
your hands are going to bleed.

412
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,808
If you jerk them off,

413
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,436
the next thing you know,

414
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,272
they'll shove their asses
asking you to suck them.

415
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,982
Asking to kiss them, you mean.

416
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,568
You think it's funny?

417
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,945
Anyway,

418
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,908
whenever I step out of the church,

419
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:18,870
he annoys the hell out of me
acting like they own the town.

420
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,413
It pisses me off!

421
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,873
I get you, I do.

422
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,751
Just hang in there
a little bit more, sweety.

423
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,337
Soon enough,

424
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,882
from every asshole to gas-hole
in this town,

425
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:34,636
I'll let everyone know who owns this town.

426
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,198
Thank you, teacher.

427
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,377
- Hey.
- Damn it.

428
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:51,421
Kwon Min-jung?

429
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,507
You know my name already?

430
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:56,134
I didn't.

431
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,720
- It's on your name tag.
- What?

432
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,889
KWON MIN-JUNG

433
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,309
Have you been staring at my chest?

434
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,977
What?

435
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,187
Jeez.

436
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,857
Why were you following me?

437
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,943
I wasn't following you.

438
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:17,072
I was just on my way home.

439
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,907
Fine. Be on your way, then.

440
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,242
Wait.

441
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:24,996
You're...

442
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:28,792
I mean, your big sister is in trouble.

443
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,543
My big sister?

444
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,505
FORECLOSURE

445
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,597
Wow, she really came alone.

446
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,810
Dude.

447
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,603
She's here.

448
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:49,979
Wow.

449
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,982
KUMSU ARCADE

450
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,700
I bet 10,000 won on you
showing up alone.

451
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,993
Never mind that.
I told you to delete them.

452
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,663
I thought you told me to complete them.

453
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,712
That was sick.

454
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,092
The one I sent you was just a prototype.

455
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,679
But I just made some epic masterpieces.

456
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,016
- Wow.
- Fucking amazing.

457
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,730
Look at her face.

458
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:34,858
It's simple.

459
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,527
Just do as I tell you,

460
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,072
and these pictures
won't hit the social media.

461
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,491
I told you, I'm not on social media.

462
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,785
Fuck, we know you aren't.

463
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,621
But the rest of us are,

464
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,958
and we'll share your picture to jerk off.

465
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,378
Fuck.

466
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,548
What do you want me to do?

467
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,800
Let's see.

468
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:05,638
I can ask you to cut out your flesh,

469
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,352
or harvest your organs and sell them.

470
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,900
I'm just kidding!

471
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,361
I'm not a thug, you know?

472
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,988
As students, we should do something

473
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:25,116
lucrative and productive...

474
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:30,580
- and something upright.
- He's crazy.

475
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,165
"Something upright."

476
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,045
What do you mean, I got it all wrong?

477
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,047
She's my little sister,
not my older sister.

478
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,050
And she's not in trouble, they are.

479
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,094
What are you talking about?

480
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:46,304
You have no idea how horrible they are!

481
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,615
Fuc Kyu-tae...

482
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,451
He's a monster.

483
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:10,704
You heard it right.

484
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,456
Heard what right? What?

485
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,419
The new kid who beat up a bully
and was kicked out.

486
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,547
- It's not a false rumor, it's true.
- What is she talking about?

487
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,884
And not just one bully,
but a bunch of them.

488
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,556
So you're saying it's not Baek Ji-hoon,

489
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:32,517
but you, Baek Ji-woo

490
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:34,811
who beat up the bullies?

491
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,189
Is she for real?

492
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:41,693
Ma'am.

493
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,612
Do you expect me to believe that bullshit?

494
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,657
No need to believe,
you'll experience it soon.

495
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,330
I have no choice.

496
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:57,125
This punk has no common sense.

497
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,465
What?

498
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,717
You're going to beat us up, too?

499
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,112
Tell you what,
I'll even let you take the first swing.

500
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:14,476
- Whoa, that girl's fierce.
- You got to be kidding me.

501
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,147
What kind of a man would I be
if I hit a girl?

502
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,066
You bitch!

503
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,486
- You fuck.
- Whoa.

504
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:31,576
Well,

505
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,703
are you done?

506
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,082
Not done yet--

507
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,298
- Shit.
- Hey, you better stay put.

508
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:47,092
You don't want to break the other hand.

509
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,929
You want everyone to know
the new kids broke both your hands?

510
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,473
When this asshole wakes up,

511
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:57,060
tell him to delete the pictures
and stay under the radar.

512
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:58,687
Fuck!

513
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,071
Are you okay?

514
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,489
I knew it.

515
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,409
Grandpa is never wrong.

516
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:14,703
Let's just go. Come on.

517
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,541
Fuck.

518
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,675
Don't butt in.

519
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,427
My business. I'll deal with it.

520
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,096
It's not your business
I'm concerned about.

521
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,018
I have to go to cram school.

522
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,233
DO IT RIGHT, MIN-JUNG.

523
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,693
OR I'LL BEAT YOU UP AGAIN.

524
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,156
That dirtbag. Fucking asshole.

525
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,077
Beating him a few more times
won't change a scum like him.

526
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,121
Unless you kill him off.

527
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,247
What?

528
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:04,711
I'm saying, I don't want to move again.

529
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,215
For some reason,
I like this town and school.

530
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,135
Let's take him home.

531
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:17,682
She told us so. Mom will take care of him.

532
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,772
- I'm afraid he's...
- Yeah.

533
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,774
He's been abused.

534
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,446
His bones show signs of healing
after several fractures.

535
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:32,405
Jeez.

536
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,533
It's a miracle he's even alive.

537
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,536
Why would he do it?

538
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:44,542
He tried to endure his owner
but couldn't take it anymore.

539
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,587
No, not Simbok.
I'm talking about that pastor.

540
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:51,508
He must have known
we'd find out about the abuse right away.

541
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,764
Okay, let's sedate him first.

542
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,433
And let him rest for a while.

543
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,559
Yeah.

544
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,698
Ji-hoon!

545
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,157
What happened to your face?

546
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,244
- What's that blood?
- No, I'm fine.

547
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,372
You, what did you do on your first day?

548
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,374
And Ji-woo? Where is she?

549
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,376
Ji-woo.

550
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,006
What...

551
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,966
Who is this gentleman?

552
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:37,095
- Did you do it again?
- I had my reasons, damn it.

553
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:40,598
- Good god!
- It's okay, he's not dead.

554
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,643
- No problem.
- He's the problem, not us.

555
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,113
What a scumbag, good-for-nothing.

556
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,158
- The evil bastard.
- Father!

557
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,493
- Please!
- What?

558
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,996
What is all this?

559
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,916
How can a human being
do this to another person?

560
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,835
Are we supposed to just sit back?

561
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:10,086
Or what?

562
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,465
What can we do in our current situation?

563
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,510
Grandpa.

564
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,387
There are so many victims.

565
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,432
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

566
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:26,936
First, he puts their face
on some nasty pictures to harass them.

567
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,438
Take your clothes off.

568
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,148
Take it off.

569
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,942
Eventually, he takes real pictures
and blackmails them.

570
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,488
TODAY'S BOYFRIENDS
Sex chats, nude cams, phishing...

571
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,114
Hello.

572
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:40,909
Thank you for checking out my chat room.

573
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,079
Some were even pimped out to older men

574
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,499
as if they were real slaves.

575
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,043
SLAVE
OBEY

576
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,921
Okay, since this is a serious issue,

577
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,964
we should call the police, shouldn't we?

578
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,008
If that could solve the problem,

579
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,260
you think this asshole
would dare pull this crap?

580
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,472
You told us to take our problems home.

581
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,640
That you'll fix them.

582
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,852
But technically, this isn't your problem.

583
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,271
I told you so.

584
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,191
I never expected anything less
from the sick psychopath.

585
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,567
Baek Ji-woo!

586
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:16,903
Don't talk that way to your mother!

587
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:20,323
What? Do you think she has a heart?

588
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,343
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

589
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,641
Where did you learn to drive?

590
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,309
Are you okay?

591
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,770
Can't you see my neck hurts?

592
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:53,314
I'm sorry. You came out of nowhere.

593
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:54,941
Hey, lady.

594
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:57,027
Are you drunk?

595
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,279
No way. She can't drink at all.

596
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:00,655
I am sorry.

597
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:04,034
I'm unfamiliar with this place,
and it was dark...

598
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,995
Then drive when it's daytime,
in a familiar place.

599
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,081
There are too many Karens in this country.

600
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,877
Fucking bitches out on the road,
who can't even drive.

601
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:25,305
What?

602
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:27,557
What?

603
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,059
What...

604
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:30,852
Where are you going?

605
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,020
What is it?

606
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:33,897
What are you doing?

607
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,359
And you tell us to hold back.

608
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,289
What?

609
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,210
Do you know who I am?

610
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:04,094
I'm not Karen, I'm Yeong-su.

611
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:07,389
And I have a Class 1 Large license
and even a bus driver's license.

612
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,140
Who are you calling a lousy driver?

613
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,310
Damn, you scared me.

614
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:28,993
What is this?

615
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,330
When he reached for his pocket,

616
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,249
I got a bad feeling so I just...

617
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:35,500
You did well.

618
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:40,005
If you hadn't,
I would have slapped his face apart.

619
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:50,348
Look, all he ever did was swear.

620
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:53,393
And you dragged him here
and locked him up like an animal.

621
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,103
You call that normal?

622
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:56,980
Well...

623
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,524
for your mom and dad,

624
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:01,735
- it's easier this way.
- Father, please!

625
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:05,113
Besides, I locked him up. Not your mom.

626
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,824
Hey, listen. I'm sorry.

627
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,244
Didn't I tell you I'd kill you
if you removed the cover?

628
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,330
I didn't?

629
00:40:15,081 --> 00:40:15,957
I did, right?

630
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,752
I'm confused, did I tell you or not?

631
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,046
Anyways, don't take it down or you die.

632
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:22,797
Just sit tight.

633
00:40:30,555 --> 00:40:31,848
So?

634
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:33,725
What do you guys want?

635
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:39,064
I want you to fix that problem.

636
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,107
Do it your way, Mom.

637
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,029
Hey, what do you mean, "Mom's way"?

638
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:50,492
Ji-woo may have never seen it, but I have.

639
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,497
What is he talking about?

640
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:57,582
He knows.

641
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,502
- He saw everything.
- Saw what?

642
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:02,921
I don't care.

643
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:05,840
That asshole took pictures.
Pictures of me!

644
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,861
The bastard needs fixing.

645
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,072
That's right!

646
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,741
- Now Ji-woo can know--
- Yeong-su, honey.

647
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,577
I understand how you feel,

648
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:37,372
but we agreed to lay low
until we were done--

649
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:38,498
Stop!

650
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,166
Take him outside.

651
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,544
Okay, sure.

652
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:46,006
Come on, let's go.

653
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,882
What if they sniff us out?

654
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,135
We'll deal with it later. Just get out.

655
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,522
Ji-hoon, take Simbok out.

656
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:03,690
Yeah.

657
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:11,906
Nope.

658
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:15,869
Look who's drinking.

659
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,253
Has Yeong-su told you

660
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,798
why she came back to this town?

661
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,760
Beats me.

662
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,846
I wonder why she wanted to come back.

663
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,766
- I think--
- I think, Yeong-su--

664
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:39,059
Wait.

665
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:42,145
What was all that about
Ji-hoon saw everything?

666
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,400
It was when he just started
elementary school.

667
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:50,528
He saw his mother do the deed.

668
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:52,322
Seriously?

669
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:57,118
Whether he was too young to remember

670
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,496
or pretended he didn't know anything,

671
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,039
he never said anything.

672
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,959
Why didn't you tell me
and keep it to yourself?

673
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:05,960
And what if I did?

674
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,297
What would you have done, you blockhead?

675
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:22,936
I've always thought

676
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:28,066
there was something not quite right
about this whole town.

677
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:31,569
Today, I found something
definitely not right.

678
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,989
What now?

679
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:36,658
Look.

680
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,037
In Korea, there are chicken restaurants
and churches in every other building.

681
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:44,207
But here, I don't see
any red cross signs at night.

682
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,334
Even when the pastor paid us a visit.

683
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:48,962
I guess.

684
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:53,258
Perhaps not many people here
believe in salvation.

685
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:56,928
Maybe you're right.

686
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:02,283
But I have a feeling
we may find our salvation here.

687
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:16,781
Attention.

688
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:21,745
Whatever you imagined,

689
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:24,122
it's going to be much worse,
so watch closely.

690
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:31,963
You pay attention, too.

691
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,718
What is this place?

692
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,472
You motherfuckers!

693
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,142
That's no way to talk to an adult.

694
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:45,643
Who the hell are you?

695
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:47,520
You don't need to know yet.

696
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:51,524
Soon, you'll remember forever
even if you don't want to.

697
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,321
Wait.

698
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,824
Why are you doing this to me?

699
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:07,957
"You are my slave,
and you must obey my orders."

700
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,378
"If I tell you to cut out your flesh,
you do that."

701
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,880
"If I tell you to sell your organs..."
Jeez...

702
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,133
So you did this, right?

703
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,600
You're doing this to me
over something so small?

704
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:26,685
"Small"?

705
00:45:26,768 --> 00:45:29,729
The victims will live
with the pain forever,

706
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,314
and that's "small"?

707
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:36,861
Wait, what is this?

708
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:38,905
Some sort of stimulant.

709
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,950
When the pain and shock get unbearable,

710
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,078
we don't want you passing out.

711
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:46,454
What?

712
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,957
You're fucking insane!

713
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:55,422
Why won't this rascal pick up the phone?
We're late for church.

714
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:08,768
You must weigh like, 70kg?

715
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:12,355
Then what will be the weight of your sins?

716
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:15,900
Stop talking fucking nonsense!

717
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:16,860
Then again,

718
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:20,488
you're evil to the bones
so cutting out the flesh won't do.

719
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:23,783
We should throw you in a pot
and boil your bones.

720
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:28,663
But that would be too harsh
for a minor like you.

721
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:32,000
So I'll just take 1kg.

722
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,588
Wait, hold on.

723
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:38,048
Hold on!

724
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,134
Actually, the butt will be easier for me
and hurt less for you.

725
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:44,346
But you're a boy.

726
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,806
Cutting that part
is an immoral thing to do.

727
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,766
SIN

728
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:50,727
Are you seriously talking
about morals right now?

729
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:52,812
It's going to hurt like hell.

730
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:55,023
But don't worry, it won't kill you.

731
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,234
I'm an expert
when it comes to this sort of thing.

732
00:50:59,642 --> 00:51:01,644
