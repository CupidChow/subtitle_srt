1
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,777
Father!

2
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,910
Luckily, it went right through.

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,496
Once we stop the bleeding, you'll be fine.

4
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,500
Chul-su,

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,921
that blockhead actually said
something right for once.

6
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,090
But I messed up.

7
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:54,387
I really thought
I could convince your mother, too.

8
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,318
I'm disappointed.

9
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,946
You trained yourself to death
for all those years

10
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,700
just to steal the country's assets?

11
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,578
They are just innocent babies.

12
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,375
So what?

13
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,794
Are you two...

14
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,423
playing house, trying to pretend
you're the mom now?

15
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,177
You'd be lucky
if you don't end up killing them.

16
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,764
Living in here or dying out there,
it's the same.

17
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,849
As your mother!

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,228
I sacrificed so much to raise you.

19
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,448
So, you really want to die?

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,661
Take one more step,
and you are no longer my daughter.

21
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,205
Good.

22
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,749
I didn't want to kill my mom.

23
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,709
What?

24
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,753
Attention.

25
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,097
I'm not killing my mom right now.

26
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,517
I'm taking down
Captain An So-jin of Special Trainings.

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,395
So I'll have no guilt...

28
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,773
of killing my mom.

29
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,733
Guilt?

30
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,818
Bullshit!

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,863
Have you ever even had real feelings?

32
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,365
Go ahead, kill me.

33
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:10,148
FAMILY MATTERS

34
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,988
Why on earth did you let him go?

35
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,992
Let's say I did. Why do you think?

36
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,496
To catch him again. All of us together.

37
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,915
Wait.

38
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,252
You knew from the start?

39
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,046
I did.

40
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,884
The first thing I did was check the trunk
when we brought him in.

41
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,206
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>this was serious trouble.</i>

42
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,126
<i>But then I figured</i>

43
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,090
maybe this wasn't a crisis
but a godsend opportunity.

44
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,097
<i>The bigger of an uphill battle we face</i>

45
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,852
<i>the better this family will come together</i>
<i>with all our hearts.</i>

46
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,648
<i>And if we all catch him together</i>

47
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,275
<i>that'll be</i>

48
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,238
our chance to become a real family.

49
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,992
Didn't you think
the kids could be in danger?

50
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,871
Even if we let him go,
he wouldn't be able to report it.

51
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:52,917
And if it came down to it,
I thought I'd take the body to the police.

52
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,502
Look at us.

53
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,049
Compared to yesterday,

54
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,302
don't we feel
a little more like a real family today?

55
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,472
Father!

56
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,268
Why do you keep making the same mistakes
and causing trouble?

57
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,103
"Mistakes"? "Trouble"?

58
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,689
That's rich,
coming from a blockhead like you.

59
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,857
Anyway!

60
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,818
You should've kept the kids out of it.

61
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,236
Kids?

62
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,989
You think you were kids back then?

63
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,223
At the end of the day,
she's still the mom who raised you.

64
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,602
No need to create hell in your heart
because of her.

65
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,715
The moment you step out of here,
the real hell begins.

66
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,844
I'll send men to hunt you down every day

67
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,180
until I tear you and those kids
into pieces.

68
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,934
In the end,

69
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,355
there are consequences for your actions!

70
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,818
<i>Yes, we were just kids.</i>

71
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,448
That's why we made the mistake
of listening to you.

72
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,463
Quiet!

73
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,008
Damn, look at you guys shut up.

74
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,635
Alright, listen up.

75
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,263
From now on,
whether you're a girl or a boy

76
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,017
bullying, forcing someone to run errands,
ripping off and beating up

77
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,101
are strictly forbidden.

78
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:16,311
And...

79
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,107
if Fuc Kyu-tae took pictures of you
and blackmailed you,

80
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,693
write down what happened
and give it to Baek Ji-hoon.

81
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,195
Don't worry.

82
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,616
I know my way around this stuff,
so I'll handle it as quietly as possible.

83
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,915
What?

84
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,961
You said I'm the official top dog here
and you wouldn't care whatever I'd do.

85
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,340
Did I piss you off?

86
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:53,390
- That's only when you follow my orders--
- By the way,

87
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,975
I don't need this anymore.

88
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:00,689
My grandpa said
I wasn't meant to work under anyone.

89
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,107
He told me to be my own boss.

90
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,027
So I'm going to do what I want.

91
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,071
And as for what you want...

92
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,490
don't even try.

93
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,242
Unless you want to die.

94
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,929
Did you see Jae-gon's face?

95
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,682
- He totally freaked out.
- Right.

96
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,352
And you had charisma
at the teacher's desk.

97
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,985
How's school? Everything's good?

98
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,153
Yes!

99
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,323
Today, Ji-woo was officially crowned
our school's number one.

100
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,200
Number one, my ass.

101
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,203
Everyone wants to take pictures with me.
It's annoying.

102
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,830
No pictures allowed.

103
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,457
Figures.

104
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,835
- What about the jerk behind this?
- Father, please!

105
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,838
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'll root out--

106
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,347
Whoa!

107
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,473
Wow!

108
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,641
Is this a laptop? For me?

109
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,560
As promised.

110
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,729
Thank you so much.

111
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,314
Whoa.

112
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,027
Lame.
Bet it's not even worth 300,000 won.

113
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,822
You should've gotten one for Ji-woo, too.

114
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,949
Forget the laptop,
how about a notebook for facebook?

115
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,369
Just look at her.

116
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,538
She cleaned her bowl
right down to the last grain.

117
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,875
I'll get Ji-woo a smartphone soon.

118
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,752
A smartphone? No way.

119
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,296
What? You have one!

120
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,923
Just as long as she doesn't take pictures.

Damn it.

138
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,607
You little shit.

139
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,818
I heard you were late today.

140
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,403
Who do you think you are?

141
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,989
I am sorry.

142
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,910
No need to be sorry.

143
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,165
Just wondered
if you'd run off somewhere, that's all.

144
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,835
No problem for me. I've got these.

145
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,088
But think of your father.

146
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,383
If his one and only daughter vanished,

147
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:41,219
what would he even live for?

148
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:48,643
And I told you to wear skirts.
Why are you so stubborn?

Damn it.

Please!

162
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,630
Shit.

00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,764

165
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,770
Yeah, that's me. Who's this?

166
00:14:55,854 --> 00:15:01,109
<i>I was just wondering</i>
<i>how your son's legs were doing.</i>

167
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,696
Who are you
and how did you know my kid got hurt?

168
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,282
So, he did get hurt, huh?

169
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,784
What the...

170
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,537
<i>I'll send you a private video of your son.</i>

171
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,790
Not that kind of video.
A clip of him privately getting scolded.

172
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:29,137
It kind of looks like hypnosis,
but I can't say for sure.

173
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,097
No drug reaction either.

174
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,309
Then why is he like this?

175
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:39,397
Medically, we'd call it "a phantom pain."

176
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,983
A what pain?

177
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:43,902
"Phantom"?

178
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:48,073
Yeah, phantom.
There's no physical injury, right?

179
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,409
Yet he's still feeling intense pain.

180
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,578
So, it's phantom pain.

181
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,837
We need to check the car
they dumped the victim in.

182
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,632
Why are you always looking into that van?

183
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,592
What about the vehicle records?

184
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:11,137
Neither the car nor the van shows up.
It's unregistered.

185
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,432
Hey, look. This van's yellow.

186
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,060
Doesn't it look like
a daycare or preschool bus?

187
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:22,148
Yeah, I think
I see some letters on the sign.

188
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,274
But the image quality's crap.

189
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,734
Look at this.

190
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,447
Per... fect... even?

191
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,740
Eureka!

192
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,617
The animal hospital!

193
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,411
The Perfect Even Animal Hospital!

194
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,830
What?

195
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,457
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

196
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:46,631
Damn it!

197
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,326
This little kitten might be hurt.

198
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,538
Are you the vet here?

199
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,459
Yes, I am.

200
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,860
Life is just so tough, isn't it?

201
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,451
That dog looks like he's been abused, too.

202
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,745
Poor thing.

203
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,247
Can't even speak about the pain.

204
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,309
LOSER

205
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,732
<i>What, does your family have zero fear?</i>

206
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,404
Or maybe you're scared out of your minds?

207
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,784
<i>Pulling that stunt with the body</i>
<i>and dragging the whole family in?</i>

208
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,829
We couldn't leave
the body of the poor woman in the trunk.

209
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:45,000
Not that you'd actually get it.

210
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,126
<i>"Get it"?</i>

211
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,715
<i>A pretty girl being feisty.</i>
<i>Now you're just tempting me.</i>

212
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,174
Lame.

213
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,176
Is that it? I'm hanging up.

214
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,302
Wait, hold up!

215
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,431
You're about to have a visitor.

216
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,515
Visitor?

217
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:02,976
You called the cops?

218
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,103
<i>Are you crazy? Why call the cops?</i>

219
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,022
Not the cops.

220
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,734
I tipped off the dad
of that kid you messed up.

221
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,861
And you know what?

222
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:17,490
His dad happens to be Joe Hae-pal,
the national gang boss.

223
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>He's more knife than talk--</i>

224
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,290
What the fuck.

225
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,046
What is this?
They drugged him up or something?

226
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,343
Nothing showed up on the drug tests.

227
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:41,681
Something definitely went down,
but who knows what?

228
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,102
What about the animal hospital?

229
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,979
See anything?

230
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,774
Nothing much.

231
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,779
But that young bitch is a sly, feisty one.

232
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,821
Right?

233
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,325
She looks pretty enough
but something is off, damn it!

234
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,704
Guess all the pretty ones
just dropped dead, huh?

235
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:09,417
The moment I looked at her, I could tell
she's got that whole black widow vibe.

236
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,171
What happened, my baby?

237
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,550
Mommy! What took you so long?

238
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,593
My baby!

239
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,804
Look at you! Why's your face so thin?

240
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,348
And why the wheelchair?

241
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,602
Stop crying!

242
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,361
<i>Hae-pal, you son of a bitch.</i>

243
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,738
I told you I ain't selling.

244
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:44,869
Sending some snot-nosed little punks
to push a fucking contract on me?

245
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,998
<i>And I thought we were friends!</i>

246
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,834
Yeah, you're right.

247
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,546
I should've come to you directly
to sort things out.

248
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,883
Guess I was way out of line on that one.

249
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,677
Fuck.

250
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,349
Where are you going
in the middle of all this?

251
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,313
- Out to blow off some steam.
- What?

252
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,858
I'm going to buy
the Shinara Night Club building!

253
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,319
Alright then. That's my man, good man.

254
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,114
I'll watch Kyu-tae. Go on, do your thing.

255
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,869
And that animal hospital...

256
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,579
Nah, forget it.

257
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,331
I'll handle that myself, too.

258
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:36,463
I may not be a loyal gangster
but I should be a reliable father for him.

PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

260
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,351
Excuse me.

261
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,404
Do you work for Kyu-tae's father
by any chance?

262
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,114
Who?

263
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,493
We're from the Kumsu Police Department.

264
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,620
The police?

265
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,082
Detective Kang Jeong-hwan
from the homicide squad.

266
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,379
What brings the detectives
all the way here?

267
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,923
On the night of the 15th...

268
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,174
Here.

269
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,136
This is your car, right?

270
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,516
Yeah, that's ours.

271
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,187
Excuse me.

272
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,023
Why doesn't it show up
in the vehicle registry?

273
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,150
Is it an unregistered car?

274
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,653
Damn it!

275
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,448
I knew this would happen.

276
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:53,289
That car was dumped on me
by some guy who owed me money.

277
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,458
I'm the victim here.

278
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:59,379
I was planning to sue him anyway.
I guess this worked out better.

279
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,047
Let's head down to the station.

280
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,882
Actually, we're not here for that.

281
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,598
We were wondering
if you've seen this car around.

282
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,017
We haven't seen it.

283
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,185
Really?

284
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,440
It's been all over the news lately.
Are you sure?

285
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,612
This case!

286
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:29,367
Actually, I was going to tip the police
about this case.

287
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:30,785
Sir.

288
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,831
Have you seen this car before?

289
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,625
Not the car exactly.

290
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:42,005
But you know those guys
dressed like animals?

291
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:47,886
I think I saw something similar that night
at that nightclub

292
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,721
or karaoke bar nearby.

293
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:54,434
They were dancing around,
saying they were doing some event.

294
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,853
Really?

295
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,189
By the way,

296
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,275
about that night...

297
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,823
Where were you coming from?

298
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,247
Our family was moving in here.

299
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,665
Moving?

300
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,378
In the middle of the night?

301
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,258
Moving at night isn't illegal, is it?

302
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,637
Of course not.

303
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:34,015
Thank you for your help. Let's go.

304
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,319
You saw it, right? The cable tie!

305
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,489
But it's a common thing.
Let's check out that nightclub first.

306
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:11,386
It was not "Perfect Even,"
but "Pawfect Haven."

307
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:14,431
Look at this! "Pawfect," get it?

308
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:18,977
But it doesn't look much like a haven.
Anyway, let's just go.

309
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,773
What are they up to?
You think they know everything?

310
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,400
Come on.

311
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,695
If they did,
they'd have cuffed us right away.

312
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,948
Seriously, we're in this mess
because of you!

313
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,658
Just stay quiet.

314
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,288
The cops aren't the problem.

315
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,331
- What?
- What?

316
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:45,545
You guys got no fuckin' brains, huh?

317
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:50,842
He got his daughter's wedding next month.
We can't have him looking all busted!

318
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,178
Well, what can we do?

319
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,723
I had no idea
who I was messing with, Mr. Joe.

320
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,849
My apologies.

321
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,560
No, you really had no idea.

322
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,360
I used to be a jellyfish with no guts,

323
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,946
but now I'm reborn
as a stingray full of venom.

324
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,199
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.

325
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,534
- Get started!
- Yes, boss!

326
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,705
I'm really so sorry.
No! Please, don't do this!

327
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,918
No! Joe, let me go!

328
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,211
- Joe!
- Hold him down.

329
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,671
Please, spare me!

330
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:43,311
Why the hell isn't this cutting well?
Got to get the damn knives sharpened.

331
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,604
Hold him tight.

332
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,483
Boss!

333
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:54,030
- You can't come in right now.
- Get out of my way!

334
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,616
Coming through.

335
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,621
Hey, it's Joe the Jackass Jellyfish!

336
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,625
It's "Stingray," not "Jellyfish."

337
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,544
What brings you here anyway?

338
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,921
And you? What the hell are you doing here?

339
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,758
I heard you're running a restaurant.
Still doing shady business?

340
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,553
Come on.

341
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:19,305
I ditched that thug life ages ago.

342
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:20,974
I'm a businessman now. Real legit.

343
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,434
Son of a bitch.

344
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:24,728
As if I'd buy that shit.

345
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:25,687
Show him.

346
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:34,070
These were used at the event here, right?
Yes or no?

347
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,614
What are these? How am I supposed to know?

348
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,366
I just bought this building today.

349
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,160
Come on.

350
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,543
What's this bracelet?

351
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:52,088
What? It's from my church.

352
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,132
Church?

353
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,176
Didn't you know?

354
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,261
I go to church now.

355
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,973
I'm washing away all my past sins
to get to heaven.

356
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,894
Bullshit!

357
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,696
Seriously, I'm a Christian now!

358
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,992
Are you getting old and deaf
or just losing your edge?

359
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:30,001
A thug like you would never
get his hands dirty without cash involved.

360
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,003
By the way,

361
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,048
what's the name of your church?

362
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,633
The Aspirations Church.

363
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,093
"Aspirations"?

364
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,808
Look at you aspiring to go to hell.

365
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,061
It would make me sick
to see guys like you succeed.

366
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,314
You're so damn greasy.

367
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,525
Lay off the damn meat.

368
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,615
What the fuck.

369
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:05,078
A crazy bitch messes with me,
and now that crazy dog?

370
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,079
Get him out!

371
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,916
- I'll finish Mr. Kim off.
- Just leave him.

372
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,087
That cop is like a bloodhound.
If he catches a whiff, we're all screwed.

373
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:20,844
Mr. Kim, that mad dog saved your life.

374
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,473
- What about the other thing?
- Yes, we got the guys on standby.

375
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,684
Good. Damn it.

376
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:32,313
They made my boy shed tears of blood,
so let's see what they shed.

377
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,065
<i>Come on.</i>

378
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:38,862
Even thugs wouldn't mess with kids, right?

379
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,572
In this nation of law and order!

380
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,615
Right?

381
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,493
Law and order...

382
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,540
But don't you think
we're the last people to say that?

383
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,624
What?

384
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,295
But we had good intentions...

385
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,007
And besides,

386
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:04,095
do you think Ji-woo couldn't handle
a few gangsters?

387
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,056
Of course she can.

388
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,141
That's exactly the problem.

389
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,570
What? You want to take her place?

390
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,324
Come on.

391
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:11,621
You're not in it for money.
You just want to be the devil, right?

392
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:17,168
You just enjoyed making them obey you
and ruling over them like slaves.

393
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:26,636
Wow.

394
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,054
PERSONAL INFORMATION

395
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,556
How'd you figure this out?

396
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,274
Really?

397
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,903
Running late tonight?

398
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:47,365
Nah, it's all good. Stay over if you want.

399
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:49,951
I'm pulling an all-nighter anyway.

400
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,536
<i>I got it!</i>

401
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:58,001
Did that bastard sniff out
some dirty shit again?

402
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,003
Why is he so excited?

403
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,214
There you go.

404
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:08,261
Why is she being so nice all of a sudden?

405
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,431
Maybe I'll get to blow another load.

406
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,642
- Sir!
- Yes?

407
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,394
Give me the key please, I'll move the car.

408
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,563
You don't have to. I'll be back out soon.

409
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,606
Actually,

410
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:24,903
people keep complaining about you
parking in the disabled spot.

411
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,448
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

412
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,914
Excuse me, sir, just a moment.

413
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,045
Bastard!

414
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:49,010
You old bastard!

415
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,887
Aren't you worried about your daughter?

416
00:32:52,889 --> 00:32:53,890
Shit!

417
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,686
If she loses her job,
you'll be out of that tiny apartment.

418
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,479
How would you like that, huh?

419
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:03,525
You think she's keeping her job
because she's talented?

420
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,696
My apologies. I didn't think it through.

421
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,115
Right.

422
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,371
You better remember
who's putting food on your table.

423
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,207
And you better behave.

424
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,626
Know your place, you servant.

425
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,379
Have a good one.

426
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,676
<i>Ever heard of "kick the cat effect"?</i>

427
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:36,224
Someone dumps their messed-up feelings
on a weaker person.

428
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,021
And that person does the same
to someone even weaker, and so on.

429
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,191
Bad feelings spread like a virus,

430
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:50,405
until they finally reach the weakest link
and a stray cat gets kicked.

431
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,867
That's the vibe in this neighborhood.

432
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,328
Maybe that's why I like it here.

433
00:33:58,163 --> 00:33:59,831
You're really something.

434
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,042
I didn't really do much.

435
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:06,212
I expected more, but you've let me down.

436
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:10,216
Still.

437
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:16,389
You know you and that old guy
have to pay for what you did, right?

438
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,602
Even a cat being kicked every day
has hidden claws.

439
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,617
Why haven't they called?

440
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,371
This is making me nervous.
Should I go pick them up?

441
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,749
Yeah, maybe that's best...

442
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,128
Everything's okay, Ji-hoon?

443
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,465
<i>Huh? Of course. Nothing's wrong.</i>

444
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,426
That's a relief.

445
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:54,803
<i>Actually,</i>

446
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:58,431
there's one more thing
you might want to handle.

447
00:34:58,515 --> 00:34:59,349
<i>"Handle"?</i>

448
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:03,186
<i>There's an adult involved besides Jae-gon.</i>

449
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,481
<i>He's a city official named Jang No-won.</i>

450
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,026
Alright. Got it.

451
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,833
She's eating well now.

452
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,422
When she was inside,
she wouldn't eat and just kept hissing.

453
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:40,807
She won't talk, so it's hard to know
what's really troubling her.

454
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,308
If she could talk...

455
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:48,481
Then would you be able to handle it?

456
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,275
Well, maybe.

457
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:52,235
Let's hear it first.

458
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,573
If it's something I can help with,

459
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,659
I'll handle it.

460
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:32,692
You're home.

461
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,111
- Yeah, I'm home.
- Okay.

462
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,918
Dad.

463
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:55,465
If work is too much,
you should just quit and rest at home.

464
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,009
Nah.

465
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:03,807
By the way, do you have to head back
to the office again after dinner?

466
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,266
Yeah.

467
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,566
You're not doing all this overtime
because of me, are you?

468
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,444
No, not at all.

469
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,572
Go ahead, before it gets cold.

470
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,117
Alright, let's eat.

471
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:30,291
CHIEF OFFICIAL JANG

472
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,933
CHIEF OFFICIAL JANG

473
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:58,903
I should shove his balls
down that asshole's throat!

474
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,489
Damn it!

475
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,038
Don't answer it.

476
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:15,211
Why are you alone? Where's Ji-hoon?

477
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,839
What?
Since when were we joined at the hips?

478
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,482
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be a tough girl?

479
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,025
Why are you so weepy?

480
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,111
You got the wrong person.

481
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,738
It's not her.

482
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,953
Is it our fifth day as a couple now?

483
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,121
Sixth, actually.

484
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:52,707
You said we were not dating.

485
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,919
But look at your makeup.

486
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,962
Feels like I'm out with Ji-woo
on our first date.

487
00:38:58,046 --> 00:38:58,922
Lame.

488
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,548
Ji-hoon.

489
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:06,888
You see?

490
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,224
So let her go.

491
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,646
You shitty knucklehead bastard.
I should just...

492
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,785
Hey, the pretty mom!

493
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,787
Mr. Joe.

494
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,790
What exactly are you doing right now?

495
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,375
What does it look like?

496
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:40,422
You were so kind to my kid last time.

497
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,509
<i>So I'm just trying to return the favor.</i>

498
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,721
<i>A little mix-up in the delivery, though.</i>

499
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,640
<i>So about that,</i>

500
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:53,226
would you mind
if you bring in your daughter?

501
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:55,520
<i>Min-jung, can you hear me?</i>

502
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,773
So, you must be Ji-woo, huh?

503
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:02,986
Shit, your friend's here instead of you.

504
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:06,865
Go ahead. It's Ji-woo.

505
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:09,534
Ji-woo!

506
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,910
<i>Min-jung! You alright?</i>

507
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:14,039
I'll be there soon. Just hang on.

508
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:17,959
You're nicer than I thought, Ji-woo!

509
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:19,753
Don't forget.

510
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,131
Bring your parents with you.

511
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,509
Send me the address. I'm coming now.

512
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:29,763
But don't lay a finger on my kid
until I get there.

513
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,849
Where are you off to?

514
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,934
Where else? I should go save Min-jung.

515
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:35,852
Hey.

516
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:45,904
Hold up.

517
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:49,866
You go alone.

518
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,660
And get Ji-hoon.

519
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,579
I'll handle her problem.

520
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,831
Got it.

521
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,626
And just how exactly
do you plan to handle it?

522
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,627
Miss?

523
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,129
Trust her, just this once.

524
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:07,592
Yes, you might as well.
You have nothing to lose.

525
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:08,968
Excuse me?

526
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,762
Ji-woo, stay here with Grandpa.

527
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,098
- No, I want to--
- Listen to your mom!

528
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,021
Honey.

529
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,233
Call me when you get there.

530
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:25,068
Will do.

531
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:45,422
You came alone? Where's the kid?

532
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,466
It's no longer a children's fight.

533
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,905
You want to die? Why so late...

534
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:13,283
Who are you?

535
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,870
I'm here instead of Ju-kyung.
Will that be okay?

536
00:42:19,372 --> 00:42:20,749
"Instead"?

537
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,835
We'll see after a taste--

538
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,718
Alright, enough.

539
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,889
Ji-hoon!

540
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:37,807
Is he your dad?

541
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:39,934
Where's the daughter, then?

542
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,812
This was not our deal, you know?

543
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,731
Didn't you break it first?

544
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:47,025
Not really. I haven't touched him yet.

545
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,612
- Now you're here, I can.
- Wait.

546
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,160
His mom just wants to hear his voice.
Just one call, please.

547
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:00,121
Sure, why not?

548
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:06,211
Maybe hearing her kid's cries
will teach her to appreciate other kids.

549
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,551
Yeah, I'm here.

550
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,264
Yeah, he's fine.

551
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,477
Hang on.

552
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,984
<i>Ji-hoon? It's Mom. Are you okay?</i>

553
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:32,987
Yeah, I'm fine.

554
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:37,325
Alright then. Dad will handle it.

555
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,035
Just hang in there a bit.

556
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,079
No problem!

557
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:42,539
<i>Are you there, honey?</i>

558
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:45,834
Yeah.

559
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:49,462
<i>Remember, you cannot kill anyone.</i>

560
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:52,090
But they took the kids.
I can't let that slide.

561
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,175
Good point.

562
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,806
Fine, half-dead will do.

563
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:14,946
Please, come in.

564
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,705
Ji-hoon, you heard your mom.

565
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:26,708
Just stay put for a bit.

566
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:34,174
It'll be over soon.
Just close your eyes and hang tight.

567
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:35,759
What?

568
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,761
Just him on his own?

569
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,480
Attention!

570
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,902
