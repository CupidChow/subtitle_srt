1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,256
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,467
THREE MONTHS AGO

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,178
You've got mail.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,808
Ms. Han Young-su?

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,101
Yes.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,606
TO: HAN YOUNG-SU

7
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,210
What are these?

8
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,173
Wait.

9
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,257
NUMBER 10, X?
KUMSU CITY

10
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,593
Aren't they from the amusement park
when Ji-woo went missing years ago?

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,762
Now, it has something to do with us.

12
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,350
That bastard
dared to take a picture of Ji-woo.

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,898
I was supposed to be his tenth victim
from the beginning.

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:15,617
FAMILY MATTERS

15
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,193
Your family was the one
that brought in the body, right?

16
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,489
Yes, we were the ones who did it.

17
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,157
But this guy did the killing.

18
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,034
That car?

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,494
It's his.

20
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:04,666
It seems he staged an alibi
by crashing his car into ours.

21
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,292
Right.

22
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,336
He confessed himself.

23
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,673
You still don't get it?

24
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,677
"The serial killer
who killed nine victims so far."

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,513
No, make it ten now.

26
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,348
A.k.a. the Doom-veloper.

27
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,101
That's me.

28
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,774
So he's the killer...

29
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,987
and your family just moved the body?

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,113
That's right.

31
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:38,616
So you better get a confession
or find evidence.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,326
Do something.

33
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,338
I've said everything you told me to.

34
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,131
But now what?

35
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,507
What else?

36
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,011
Seeing how he sniffed us out
and came to us,

37
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,889
they're not that half-baked.

38
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,807
We'll have to wait and see.

39
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,559
Both of them.

40
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,645
You kids go upstairs and sleep.
It's a school night.

41
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,856
Go.

42
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,531
Mom.

43
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,241
Yes?

44
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,243
Well...

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,247
Don't do that anymore.

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,127
I don't want you to feel pain.

47
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,904
What's this?

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,325
I thought you stayed away from meat
because it made Kyu-tae uneasy.

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,868
I don't know.

50
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,079
I didn't even get stabbed,

51
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,374
but I'm craving flesh
dripping fresh blood.

52
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,962
Anything good going on?

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,547
You're all flushed.

54
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:16,923
What?

55
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,634
Flushed? Hardly!

56
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,428
By the way, where's Kyu-tae?

57
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,222
I put him in a psych ward.

58
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,016
Are you insane?

59
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,436
He's the damn son of a steakhouse owner,
but look at him!

60
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,564
He gags at the sight of meat.
What should I do?

61
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
Damn it!

62
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,818
By the way,

63
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,030
did you handle the animal hospital?

64
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,615
"The animal hospital"? What do you mean?

65
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,326
You said you'd handle it yourself!

66
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,664
That twin's psycho bitch mom,
who hurt our Kyu-tae!

67
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,751
Right!

68
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,671
Damn it, those fucking bastards. Shit.

69
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,590
Ouch!

70
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,761
What's wrong?

71
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,637
What?

72
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,355
Attention.

73
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,208
You little shit!

74
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,088
What is all this?

75
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,716
We are inside your mind.

76
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,886
It's all blurry.

77
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,763
Lame, isn't it?

78
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,515
What the fuck?

79
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,142
Did you do this to Kyu-tae, too?

80
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,730
Kyu-tae committed a grave sin.

81
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,192
So you're saying you punished him?

82
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,903
It wasn't a punishment.

83
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,906
It was a treatment.

84
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,616
What for?

85
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,702
Kyu-tae wasn't sick.

86
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,662
It was not about Kyu-tae.

87
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,708
It was for the kids
who suffered because of him.

88
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,342
KWON MIN-JUNG

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,805
They will spend their whole lives
haunted by horrific memories.

90
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,432
It's only fair he suffers the same--

91
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,977
If he's guilty, take him to court!
What gives you the fucking right?

92
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,731
I'm not saying I'm without fault.

93
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,151
I know I am to blame a little bit.

94
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,320
So, I'll extend leniency to you.

95
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,407
How dare you mess with our kids?

96
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,701
Hey.

97
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,760
Why the hell isn't this piercing well?

98
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,292
What the fuck!

99
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,878
What?

100
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,588
What's going on?

101
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,215
Can't you see I'm fucking bleeding?

102
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
What blood?

103
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,926
Fuck, look!

104
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,636
What?

105
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,640
With the stingray tail!
She stabbed me with it.

106
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,730
From now on, stay away from my kids.

107
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,277
Don't even say their names
or think about them.

108
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,904
Then, you'll be fine.

109
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,410
So this is what it was?

110
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,037
Gil-ja.

111
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,624
- I think the bitch "operated" on me, too.
- What?

112
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,752
You mean that bitch

113
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:28,049
screwed up all three of my men?

114
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,968
Those goddamn twins!

115
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,096
I shouldn't even be thinking about them.

116
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,062
Mi-ok?

117
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,940
I need you to go to school tomorrow.

118
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,572
Hypnosis, abuse
and even locking people up?

119
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,115
Yes, I'm telling you.

120
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,908
I got proof, too.

121
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,245
- What proof?
- Proof that they locked me up.

122
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,081
I have it all on video.

123
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,722
This really is serious.

124
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,140
What?

125
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:21,102
An innocent kid was framed as a murderer.

126
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,524
What? Didn't they say on the news
they caught the killer?

127
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,194
He's not the killer.

128
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,904
Right?

129
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,323
He doesn't look like a killer to me.

130
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,495
- But why bring this up?
- "Why"?

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,330
That's because...

132
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,959
you're the killer.

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,714
Are you sure?

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,717
Yes.

135
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,428
Detective. It's not me!

136
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,055
Where's the proof?

137
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,390
You go to church?

138
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,391
No.

139
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,685
I'm a Buddhist.

140
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,563
Then why would a Buddhist
be wearing a cross?

141
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,233
That's Lee Yu-jin's.

142
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,196
I got you, fucking Doom-veloper.

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,031
He finally gets it.

144
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,716
Sorry for earlier, detective.

145
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,803
We found this in the bastard's car.

146
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
Get out, you bastard.

147
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,279
Out, you sick bastard!

148
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,449
Keep still, you bastard.

149
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,534
Take this!

150
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,039
Fuck, do you think this is over?

151
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,666
Shut up, you bastard.

152
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,169
- It's all over.
- No.

153
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,254
It's not over yet.

154
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,924
He is the killer
of the Kumsuak Mountain case

155
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,053
but he's not the serial killer.

156
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,644
What are all these?

157
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,691
There's a place called Special Trainings.

158
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,529
You don't have names there,
but only marker numbers.

159
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,326
Both the killer and I are from that place.

160
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,828
"Special Trainings"?

161
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,664
What kind of place is that?

162
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,672
I could tell you everything

163
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,632
but you won't believe me.

164
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,342
So, let's keep it simple.

165
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,178
Attention.

166
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,556
You are all abandoned.

167
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,227
Don't even think about running away.

168
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,229
Attention.

169
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,150
I'll send men to hunt you down every day,

170
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,778
until I tear you and those kids
into pieces.

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,452
So, you mean in the Special Trainings,

172
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,747
they abused kids
for experiments and training.

173
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,709
And when you ran away with the babies,

174
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,003
they sent Doom-veloper to hunt you down?

175
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,505
To draw me out.

176
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,883
They've been killing people,
leaving messages.

177
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,470
That's because I'm Number 10.

178
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,736
Ho-chul.

179
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,404
Tell me.

180
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,534
Did you kill Lee Yu-jin
on Kumsuak Mountain?

181
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,455
That's right. I killed her.

182
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,915
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

183
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,834
HIM: GOOD, TEN IS PASSING BY
IT'S MOVING DAY

184
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,462
He gave me a mission.

185
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,047
"He"?

186
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,341
Who gave you a mission?

187
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,718
The Doom-veloper.

188
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,029
Stand up.

189
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,409
Jung Ho-chul.

190
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,913
You're under arrest
for the murder in Kumsuak Mountain.

191
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,207
You have the right to remain silent,

192
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,959
the right to counsel
and a review of legality of arrest...

193
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,921
Hell, do whatever you want.

194
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,048
It looks like the brain hacking worked.

195
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,049
Hold on!

196
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,178
Even after discovering the body,
you failed to report it.

197
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,433
You also did lock him up.
So I can't just let this slide.

198
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,477
Should we kill him?

199

PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

200
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,497
Jeong-hwan, what's going on?
He's the real culprit?

201
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,292
You trust me, don't you?
I'll explain everything later...

202
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,047
Though I'm not sure I can.

203
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,632
- Just get in.
- What?

204
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,592
Whatever, we caught the killer.
Talk later.

205
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,719
Sure.

206
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,491
What are you doing?

207
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,369
I'm the one who locked him up.

208
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:12,996
Arrest me.

209
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,706
No way.

210
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,001
I let him go
even after discovering the body.

211
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,836
I'm the bigger sinner here.

212
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,160
Is there any problem?

213
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,246
I don't think we can do this.

214
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,919
Ji-woo is a bit sensitive to light.

215
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,337
Oh, right.

216
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,340
The Special Training trauma.
Just a second, please.

217
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,467
I've turned off the flash.

218
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,554
Here we go.

219
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,974
One, two, three.

220
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,270
I'll take one more. One, two, three.

221
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,071
Now, this is evidence
backing up your confession

222
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,616
that you are indirectly involved
in the Kumsuak Mountain murder case.

223
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,118
You know what a mugshot is?

224
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,536
Yes.

225
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,331
And you can't leave Kumsu City
for the time being.

226
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,523
So technically,
it wasn't about pictures, but the flash.

227
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,860
She was just looking out for you.

228
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,825
How did you catch the real culprit?

229
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,662
From the beginning,
we knew he was the culprit.

230
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,290
- Detective Park! Load him up.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,711
We just waited until we were 100% sure,
until we had ironclad evidence.

232
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,552
"Kumsu Aspirations Church."

00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,681
KUMSU ASPIRATIONS CHURCH

234
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,454
Good evening, sir.
You're the pastor of this church, right?

235
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,749
I came here

236
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,169
because I thought if I pray,
maybe I could join God's family, too.

237
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,506
But it's so late now.

238
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,385
God must be asleep too, right?
I'll be off then.

239
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,427
No, sir.

240
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,390
The church of God is always wide open.

241
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,353
Please, after you.

242
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,526
Okay.

243
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,129
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

244
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,179
Mom...

245
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,059
Mom.

246
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,231
Mom.

247
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,438
- I'm off to school.
- Okay, see you.

248
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,219
So, it wasn't about pictures,
but the flash?

249
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,764
I thought you didn't allow taking pictures
because we were on the run.

250
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,140
Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,150
It's also true I didn't allow them
because we were on the run.

252
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,947
I figured it'd be better for you
to think that was the only reason.

253
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,158
Then I would've kept blaming you.

254
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,207
It's all my fault anyway.

255
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,087
So it's okay to blame me all you want.

256
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,173
What's okay about it?

257
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,592
You have no emotions, no fear.

258
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,345
Why would you give up so quickly?

259
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,560
What do you mean?

260
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:15,734
You know what?

261
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,987
I like rolled omelettes
more than fried eggs.

262
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:21,281
So...

263
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,909
don't give up
just because you've failed a few times.

264
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,788
Ji-woo.

265
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,253
I don't have any trauma, so...

266
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,932
I don't have any trauma,
so don't make a fuss about it.

267
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,100
It's lame.

268
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,900
Ji-woo!

269
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,110
Ji-woo!

270
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,102
I told you so.

271
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,480
You'd be lucky
if you didn't end up killing them.

272
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,902
So, what now?

273
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,906
It looks like she'll have to see blood
once she loses it.

274
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,877
What, did you see a ghost
or something, bitch?

275
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,755
Hey, Mi-ok.

276
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,757
Long time no see at school.

277
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,053
Right, I haven't been around a while
and now there's a shitty vibe going on.

278
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,721
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

279
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,059
Eyes down. Do you want to die?

280
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,482
Who the hell are you,

281
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:46,695
yapping your shitty piehole
in this sacred school bathroom?

282
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,698
This is Mi-ok, Ryu Mi-ok.

283
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,450
And this is Baek Ji-woo.

284
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,785
"Ryu Mi-ok"?

285
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,286
You mean "Ruin-Me-ok"?

286
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,049
You must be the bitch
who banged up Fuc Kyu-tae.

287
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,011
Follow me.

288
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,138
Let's go.

289
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:18,852
Fuck.

290
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:23,023
- Look at that bitch.
- So cocky.

291
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,483
You bitch.

292
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,069
You really followed me out here?

293
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,031
What if your face gets scratched up?

294
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,450
Don't be so quick to judge.

295
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,202
You might end up breaking your damn wrist.

296
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,414
I'm just here to ask something,

297
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,666
so put that stick away.

298
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,086
Whether it's my wrist or your face
that gets all fucked up,

299
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,755
we need to settle this.

300
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:50,884
We can't have
two bad bitches in this tiny school.

301
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,136
It'd be too much for the kids.

302
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,401
Shit.

303
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,197
You want the school bitch title?
It's yours.

304
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,575
Now, about that tattoo--

305
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,244
Fighting with your friends at school
is not cool.

306
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,583
Your frontman Fuc Kyu-tae is done for.

307
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:27,170
And you're in deep shit
for selling pictures of girls' panties.

308
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,213
You don't get to have a say.

309
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:30,298
What did you say?

310
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,759
Right.

311
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,470
Guess I jumped the fucking gun.

312
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,931
So I've done some reflecting.

313
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,099
Anyway...

314
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:44,145
what we need now isn't a pissing contest
but building networks.

315
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,532
You seem too indifferent
about social networking.

316
00:26:55,949 --> 00:27:00,870
Your family wouldn't happen to be
some kind of criminals in hiding

317
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,498
or fugitives, would they?

318
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,711
That expression is priceless.

319
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:34,696
Fuck.

320
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:39,951
Ji-woo!

321
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:42,454
Baek Ji-woo!

322
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,457
Snap out of it!

323
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,067
Min-jung, are you okay? You're bleeding.

324
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,445
Hey!

325
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,074
You and I aren't so different.

326
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,659
You said you had something to ask me.

327
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,414
Jae-gon really looks like
he's kicked the bucket.

328
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,883
Let's go. You don't have
anywhere else to go, do you?

329
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,650
INCOMING CALL

330
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,653
Hello?

331
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,034
Hello? Speak.

332
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:03,952
Mom.

333
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,329
Ji-woo?

334
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,374
Yes.

335
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,751
Ji-woo, sweety.

336
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,337
Is everything okay?

337
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:24,472
Ji-woo...

338
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,016
What about Ji-woo?

339
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:28,560
- She...
- What about her?

340
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,312
She called me "Mom."

341
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,065
Really? That's great!

342
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,819
Then she said she'd killed someone.
She was crying.

343
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:40,196
What?

344
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:41,448
Come again?

345
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:48,663
Here you go.

346
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,012
So, what did you want to ask?

347
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:05,513
Right.

348
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:08,641
Your tattoo. Where did you get it?

349
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:10,643
This?

350
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,813
Obviously, I got it at a tattoo shop.

351
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,027
Never mind. Guess I was wrong.

352
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:23,865
So, what is this place?

353
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,618
This place? We're the runaway fam.

354
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,039
It's for kids without a family like me,
or with a shitty family like yours--

355
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:36,169
Or for kids with no home to return to
because their family hates them even more.

356
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,212
Here you go.

357
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,881
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

358
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:43,968
You must be Ji-woo.

359
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:47,222
I'm a mom to Mi-ok
and the other kids here.

360
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,224
Oh, right. Okay.

361
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,894
Well, I'll get going.

362
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,062
Alright.

363
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:58,441
By the way, I checked with the school
and Jae-gon is...

364
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:03,446
pretty badly hurt.

365
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,906
He's still unconscious.

366
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,324
What?

367
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,993
I'll explain it to your mom.

368
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:13,206
I was the realtor for your house
so I know your mom well.

369
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,335
By the way, your mom has
quite a temper, too.

370
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,588
I'm afraid she would be pretty upset.

371
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:24,467
You don't know that.

372
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:29,014
I get the feeling
that things between you and your mom

373
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,142
aren't really rainbows and sunshine.

374
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,188
You poor thing.

375
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,274
Come here.

376
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,276
I get it.

377
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:44,821
Who can really know
what you're going through?

378
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,492
There, there.

379
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,141
Ji-woo?

380
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,060
No, it's Chief Oh from Kumsu Realty.

381
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,395
- Your daughter is with me.
- Excuse me?

382
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,230
What is she doing there?

383
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:23,068
It seems she had nowhere else to go
after getting into trouble.

384
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,778
"Trouble"?

385
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,238
Just put Ji-woo on, please.

386
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,281
The thing is...

387
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,159
She doesn't want to see anyone right now.

388
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,328
Guess she feels bad.

389
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:36,498
Where are you? I'm coming right now.

390
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,999
Really?

391
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,001
No rush.

392
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,837
I'll send you the address.

393
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,007
SIX MISSED CALLS

394
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:50,637
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

395
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:52,806
I'm fine.

396
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,933
Have you heard from Ji-woo?

397
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,019
No. What about the bastard Jae-gon?

398
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,731
Luckily, it isn't too serious.

399
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:04,275
Alright, let's go.

400
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,738
But I really freaked out back there.

401
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,199
I thought
Ji-woo was going to kill Jae-gon...

402
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,788
That pastor just now is Jae-gon's dad.

403
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:26,381
You're here!

404
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,429
Where's Ji-woo?

405
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,348
She's locked herself in a room.

406
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:36,766
Wait!

407
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,686
She doesn't want to see anyone right now.

408
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,355
Take a seat. Just leave her alone.

409
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,359
Take a seat.

410
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,237
Here you go.

411
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:58,329
Go ahead, try it.
My mom's cocktails are no joke.

412
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,962
But, why...

413
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,298
Why is Ji-woo here?

414
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,217
You really don't get kids, do you?

415
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,387
How did you raise them? Two of them, even.

416
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:19,976
Kids that age feel more comfortable
the farther they are from home.

417
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,314
So this place is--

418
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:29,486
As a servant of God,
how can I ignore the stray kids?

419
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,781
I started this place
just to put a roof over their heads.

420
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:36,409
It's been seven years!
But you have to spend money somewhere.

421
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,788
God, I'm so full.

422
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,793
You are

423
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,629
not quite what I expected.

424
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:48,713
Really?

425
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,965
What exactly did you expect?

426
00:34:51,508 --> 00:34:55,387
Did you think
I'd lock them up or abuse children?

427
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,514
I see.

428
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:01,351
That's why you won't even touch
this drink I made for you.

429
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,061
You think I poisoned it or something?

430
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,939
No, it's not that...

431
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,943
Who knows?
I might have poisoned your bitch daughter.

432
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,241
Damn it.

433
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:21,913
From the day I first saw your damn face,
I knew this day would come.

434
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,263
If you're so worried,
you should've gone with her earlier.

435
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,890
Young-su told me to wait.

436
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,518
If she told you to die here, would you?

437
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:44,811
Of course.

438
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:48,648
You're such a blockhead.

439
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,738
Hey! What happened?

440
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,073
We heard
Ji-woo beat the crap out of a kid.

441
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,450
Is he really dead?

442
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,452
No, he's not dead.

443
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,371
Wait, how did you know?

444
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:07,959
She's apparently with a runaway fam,
so your mom went to get her.

445
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:08,918
What?

446
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:12,047
Ji-woo's hiding with Mi-ok's runaway fam?

447
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,383
Yeah. Why are you so surprised?

448
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:19,929
That place is actually run by the church.

449
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:23,266
Jae-gon's dad owns the church.
The kid she "beat the crap out of."

450
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,441
Number 10!

451
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,278
Number 10!

452
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:42,327
This man posed a serious threat
to national security.

453
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,956
Drill a hole in his frontal lobe
to implant some conscience before he dies.

454
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,297
- Att--
- No.

455
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:57,926
Today, you'll work on him in reality.

456
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:31,459
What?

457
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:35,213
Imagined or real,
the pain and scars are the same.

458
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,924
Is doing it for real too cruel?

459
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,594
You think that's not you?

460
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:47,767
No.

461
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,854
This isn't my style.

462
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,397
Fine.

463
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,776
Number 10, it seems that

464
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,113
what you need is an ordeal, not training.

465
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:14,919
Mom?

466
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:21,426
"Mom"?

467
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:25,013
Have you been dreaming? Wake up, bitch.

468
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,264
Yeah.

469
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,016
Your expectation was correct.

470
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:34,022
They say bitches can sniff each other out.

471
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:37,484
The first time I saw you,
I could tell right away.

472
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,779
Just by looking at your beady eyes,

473
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:42,739
I knew you were not just any bitch,

474
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:46,493
but a bitch who would bury
her man and kids in a fit of rage!

475
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,373
What? Your daughter?

476
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,501
Are you afraid I buried your daughter?

477
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,347
You think I'm nuts?

478
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:10,600
I can make good money
if I feed her and send her abroad.

479
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:13,144
Why would I make that go to waste
and bury her?

480
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,065
I'll make sure
she goes to a good school abroad.

481
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:21,319
To a place where losing a kidney
won't stop her from selling her body.

482
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:28,410
I don't know how you do it
but I know you're like my pastor.

483
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:32,163
You can wrap anyone around your finger
with that tongue of yours.

484
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:33,832
I know all about it.

485
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:40,255
So today, you're going to shut your mouth
and just listen.

486
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:41,673
You got it?

487
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:51,599
Wow.

488
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:53,768
This is so touching.

489
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,105
Your imbecile husband showed up
to save you, huh?

490
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:00,191
Mi-ok, go make up some cover story.

491
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:02,610
If he doesn't buy it, just leave it.

492
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,824
I'll be watching from here.
And if things go south,

493
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:12,412
I'll hang this bitch up and go upstairs.

494
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:32,891
I told you.
Your mom came by earlier and took her.

495
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:35,352
Right, girls?

496
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:36,895
Yes.

497
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:46,821
Then where's Chief Oh?

498
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,759
Seon-suk.

499
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,053
Did Mom come by today?

500
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,555
Well...

501
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,724
Yes, earlier.

502
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:16,559
Did she?

503
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,728
It looks like she forgot her phone.

504
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,689
Are you sure?

505
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,816
That sounds like a lie.

506
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:24,818
"Lie"?

507
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:31,491
Fine. If you don't believe me,

508
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,743
feel free to search this place.

509
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,037
Go ahead.

510
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,629
Never mind.

511
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,257
Guess there has been a misunderstanding.

512
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:53,054
It's not like she's hiding somewhere...

513
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:57,267
and holding a knife to Mom's neck, is she?

514
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,274
Let's go.

515
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,069
What the fuck.

516
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,698
And I thought he was a clueless imbecile.

517
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,784
Thank god
he's actually got a head on his shoulders.

518
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,871
What a funny bastard.

519
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,050
- Min-jung.
- Yes?

520
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,260
Do you know what this place actually is?

521
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,763
It's a place for the runaway fam.

522
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:38,641
They eat, sleep and study here.

523
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,935
They also buy and sell land.

524
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:44,606
They call it an adoption center
because they put pets up for adoption.

525
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:46,566
"Adoption center"?

526
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:48,985
Dad.

527
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,947
Mom and Ji-woo are definitely in there.

528
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,407
I know.

529
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,661
But if we barged in,
Mom could have been in real danger.

530
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:08,755
I guess you were one of those girls
who got knocked up and got married.

531
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:12,050
I was the same.

532
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,845
I couldn't get an abortion anymore
so I had to shoot one out of me.

533
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,064
Both Jellyfish and me,

534
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:29,234
we couldn't even
take care of ourselves back then.

535
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,529
And changing a baby's diaper on time
was definitely too much.

536
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:35,907
So what could I do?

537
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,000
I wrapped it up nicely
and released it in the Incheon Bay.

538
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,001
No, wait.

539
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,212
Should I say dumped it, since it's dead?

540
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:55,719
Anyway, Joe the Jackass Jellyfish
never cared about his kid.

541
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,972
But when he heard the kid was missing,
he suddenly freaked out

542
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,390
saying we should find him.

543
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:02,058
So what can I do?

544
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:06,479
I grabbed a big-headed kid
at the orphanage and said he was our son.

545
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:10,734
And he's doted on him ever since.

546
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:12,777
You know what I'm saying?

547
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:14,946
That kid...

548
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:20,160
That big-headed kid is my Kyu-tae.

549
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:34,591
You still don't get
the moral of this story, do you?

550
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:39,054
For Jellyfish and me,

551
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,807
Kyu-tae is worth twice as much,
just like your twins.

552
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,477
So it won't end with your daughter.

553
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,731
Your damn son will face
the same fate soon enough.

554
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:11,002
Honey, you saw the pictures?

555
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:15,006
Just like you wanted,
I made her shed tears of blood.

556
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,425
That's my girl.

557
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:21,346
You're the real badass stingray,
Oh "The Teeth" Gil-ja.

558
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,474
Gil-ja.

559
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:28,228
Should I send you "the butchers" now?

560
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,272
Why waste the money? They cost a fortune.

561
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:35,568
It's been a while
but I'll do the handy work.

562
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,994
I'll start with the eyes.

563
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:48,373
But should I kill you first,
or gouge them out first?

564
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:50,792
Thought so.

565
00:45:52,168 --> 00:45:54,587
Gouging them out after I kill you
would be easier for me

566
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:56,297
and hurt less for you, too.

567
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,635
Don't worry, I have been trafficking
human organs for ten years

568
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,640
and personally harvested and delivered
fresh meat over 200 times.

569
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:09,310
Okay, the moment of truth.

570
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,028
Mommy's going to work late tonight,
so bring me an iced Americano.

571
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,574
Make sure the ice ball is nicely cut
and perfectly round.

572
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:39,883
You can't take it?
Or are you scared, all of a sudden?

573
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:43,636
Then what?

574
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,180
You got something to say?

575
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,517
You think I'm nuts?

576
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:54,981
If I let you open your mouth,
your razor-sharp tongue would kill me.

577
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,485
"Pawfect Haven"?

578
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:02,447
Come on! It's more like a hazard.

579
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:06,701
Still, no speaking.

580
00:47:10,205 --> 00:47:11,581
Just type it out.

581
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:21,508
AT TEN TION

582
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:23,968
"Attention"?

583
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:27,097
What the hell does that mean?

584
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,033
Fuck.

585
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:54,559
Damn it, you bitch!

586
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:57,854
Listen.

587
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,484
You don't know who you're messing with.

588
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,029
I'm Oh "The Teeth" Gil-ja.

589
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:13,578
I've torn apart and devoured
over 50 bitches and bastards

590
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,497
from their guts to bones!

591
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,590
Mi-ok, you little bitch.

592
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:30,136
Did you go all the way to Starbucks
for that coffee or what?

593
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:10,927
Young-su!

594
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:14,597
Young-su, hey. You okay?

595
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,057
Are you okay?

596
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,937
Young-su, here.

597
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,397
Young-su.

598
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,844
Young-su.

599
00:51:01,227 --> 00:51:02,395
Are you okay?

600
00:51:08,943 --> 00:51:09,986
Are you okay?

601
00:51:11,696 --> 00:51:14,491
What about you?
Mom, you're bleeding a lot.

602
00:51:15,867 --> 00:51:17,202
Mommy is okay.

603
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:20,330
It's nothing.

604
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:27,837
I'm so sorry, Mom.

605
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:32,092
I'm such a terrible daughter.

606
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:44,646
No, you're a good daughter, Ji-woo.

607
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,776
You didn't kill anyone, so it's alright.

608
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,405
That's what matters.

609
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:13,133
Damn it.

610
00:52:15,468 --> 00:52:16,845
Oh, my, what's happening?

611
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:18,430
Oh, no!

612
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:20,348
No!

613
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:21,933
What's wrong with me?

614
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,977
What's happening?

615
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:27,147
What's wrong with my legs? Oh, my god!

616
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,065
Oh, no, what's happening?

617
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:30,734
- Let's go.
- Oh, no!

618
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:33,319
What should I do?

619
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,488
Are you sure you're okay?

620
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:36,948
It hurts!

621
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:39,451
What's happening to me?

622
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:57,302
- Help us, please!
- Save us, please!

623
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,450
You damn bitch.

624
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:24,704
You're not even worthy of "Attention."

625
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,025
Most people think
a ruptured Achilles tendon is fatal,

626
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,945
but that's not always the case.

627
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,700
If you stop the bleeding...

628
00:54:03,201 --> 00:54:06,579
and get surgery in time,
you'll be walking normally within a year.

629
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,669
You bitch! What the hell are you doing?

630
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:18,508
Have you ever heard of "a lobotomy"?

631
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:28,643
It's a retro surgery for schizophrenia
back in the day.

632
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,439
You insert a tool like this...

633
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:37,027
right between the eye sockets.

634
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:42,615
Straight into the frontal lobe
to pierce a hole.

635
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,495
A hospital surgery costs a fortune.

636
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,457
It's been a while
but I'll do the handy work.

637
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,416
What?

638
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,669
Surprisingly,
it's not some ancient practice.

639
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,921
It was done until the 1960s.

640
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,467
The doctor who perfected it
even won a Nobel Prize.

641
00:55:01,176 --> 00:55:03,011
So don't worry too much.

642
00:55:05,805 --> 00:55:07,974
They don't give out Nobel Prizes
to anyone.

643
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,102
Wait! Please!

644
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:12,896
I'm so sorry!

645
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:17,025
I'm so sorry for what I did.
It's all my fault.

646
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,571
If you forgive me just this once,
I'll do whatever you want!

647
00:55:25,116 --> 00:55:25,992
Really?

648
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:27,410
Yes.

649
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:29,537
Then first...

650
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,041
answer my questions honestly.

651
00:55:33,124 --> 00:55:34,876
Sure. Whatever you want.

652
00:55:35,293 --> 00:55:39,881
I don't have any grudge
against you or your kids, really.

653
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:41,007
Not that.

654
00:55:45,011 --> 00:55:47,055
Besides you,

655
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:50,433
who else knew the exact date
we were moving?

656
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:54,437
What has that got to do with anything?

657
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,355
Oh, right!

658
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:58,525
The landlord told me, the pastor!

659
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:00,235
- "The pastor"?
- Yes.

660
00:56:00,902 --> 00:56:02,028
How did he know that?

661
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:05,073
How would I know?

662
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:09,744
That's not an answer.

663
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,540
Attention.

664
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:22,632
What exactly were you people doing here?

665
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,011
With the excuse of building a Church,

666
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:31,141
we collected funds
to buy land and buildings.

667
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,518
And the pastor ordered all of that?

668
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:34,894
No.

669
00:56:35,854 --> 00:56:38,398
Just by using his silver tongue,

670
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:42,235
people blindly followed him anywhere
like sheep.

671
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:47,866
It seemed like the perfect opportunity
to use him as our patsy.

672
00:56:48,783 --> 00:56:51,286
So, he was just a puppet?

673
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:52,912
Right.

674
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:56,541
At first, I was confident about that.

675
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,794
But looking back now...

676
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:04,215
I think I was the patsy, not him.

677
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:10,638
Worship the love of the Lord

678
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:14,934
Thank you for the love of the Lord

679
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:18,730
How amazing is the Lord's love

680
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:22,192
The love of Jehovah, the Lord

681
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,987
When you reach heaven,

682
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:28,448
you will shine next to God like a star.

683
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:29,491
Amen.

684
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:33,203
Anyone would think...

685
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:34,454
Oh, my God!

686
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:37,374
...that the pastor is a man of god by day.

687
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:41,378
But he's quite the man of sex by night.

688
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:44,381
So, yeah.

689
00:57:45,256 --> 00:57:48,426
Sometimes my face

690
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,554
would get all flushed, you know?

691
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:57,811
Guess I was craving for carnal pleasure.

692
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:02,065
I got hooked on the spicy excitement.

693
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:06,778
Even though I felt something was off,
I just couldn't stop.

694
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,279
Enough.

695
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,619
What? What is it?

696
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:15,662
You know what?

697
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:23,545
For once, I really want to see you
feeling the real, unfiltered pain.

698
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:26,006
"Real" what? What do you mean?

699
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,383
- What did you do to me?
- Nothing yet.

700
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:31,344
But I will start now.
You better brace for impact.

701
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:35,807
Don't move.

702
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:39,352
I haven't done this in a while,
so I might be a bit rusty.

703
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:45,191
Does it hurt?

704
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:46,860
But it's nothing.

705
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:48,737
No.

706
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:51,656
Real pain isn't enough for you.

707
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:55,285
By the way, "Pawfect Haven"?

708
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:58,204
That was a typo.

709
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,207
Well, it was actually supposed
to be "Pawfect Heaven."

710
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,711
But for you, this place is
a perfect hazard like you said before.

711
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:10,759
And you're not even worthy of dreaming
about heaven, so drown forever.

712
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:17,557
Attention.

713
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:23,438
This is the real moment of truth.

714
01:03:35,398 --> 01:03:37,400
