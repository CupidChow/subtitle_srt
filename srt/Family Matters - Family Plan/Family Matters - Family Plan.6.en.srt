THE LIGHT EFFECTS IN THIS VIDEO MAY CAUSE
PHOTOSENSITIVE EPILEPSY

00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:10,010
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

3
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,355
How was the Trainings Evaluation?

4
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:11,446
Overall, his hand-to-hand combat skills
and lethality seem pretty average.

5
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,448
Yes, up until recently.

6
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,909
But after an accident during the training,
he suddenly...

7
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,798
It looks like...

8
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,678
you tied them up
after making sure they were dead.

9
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,972
Why bother?

10
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,562
I wanted more.

11
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,690
"More"?

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,151
- You already killed them all.
- Exactly.

13
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,614
I wanted them to suffer
for as long as possible.

14
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,702
But they just died too fast.

15
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,706
If I tied them up tight enough,

16
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,041
I thought they might still feel pain.

17
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,377
Even for a moment after they died.

18
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,094
Too bad, huh?

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,306
It looks like your boyfriend
broke him beyond repair.

20
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:46,875
FAMILY MATTERS

21
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,849
<i>It's Yoon Myung-hwan.</i>

22
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,353
<i>He must have known</i>
<i>we'd find out about the abuse right away.</i>

23
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,522
I think I was the patsy, not him.

24
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,940
I've been waiting for you.

25
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,859
Darn it. It's definitely a bug.

26
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,779
The moment I saw him,

27
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,282
I knew I saw that face from somewhere.
I was right.

28
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,995
So, the pastor who brought Simbok in
is the Doom-veloper.

29
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,998
Who is sent by Special Trainings
to hunt us down.

30
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,878
Let me handle this.
You kids go upstairs and get some sleep.

31
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,595
I told you I'll kill that bastard.

32
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,641
Ever since the day we escaped,
it was something I needed to deal with.

33
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,018
It has nothing to do with you.

34
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,102
Young-hee!

35
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,525
It's my duty to protect you.
It's my everything!

36
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,904
How can you say
it has nothing to do with me?

37
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,494
Without you, I'm done for.

38
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,038
Chul-su is nothing without Young-hee!

39
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,468
Chul-su.

40
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,553
It's just...

41
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,641
I'm so terrified.

42
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,397
Can you really handle this?

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,856
Of course.

44
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,071
To protect Young-hee,
Chul-su can do anything!

45
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,496
I know.

46
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,668
You'd probably kill yourself to save me.

47
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,631
But if only one of us had to survive...

48
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,720
it should be Chul-su, not Young-hee.

49
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,056
For the sake of our kids.

50
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,186
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

51
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,747
KUMSU ASPIRATIONS CHURCH

52
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,641
I guess I kept you waiting.

53
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,270
"Waiting"? For who?

54
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,898
Simbok.

55
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,901
He's all treated.

56
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,166
Right. Simbok.

57
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,337
Honestly,
whether you are a person or a dog,

58
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,173
meeting the right people
is what keeps you alive.

59
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,302
That goes for Simbok, the deaconess,

60
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,221
and even that detective over there.

61
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,959
Long time no see, Number 10.

62
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,003
I'm Number 11.

63
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,088
"Number 11"?

64
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,092
But why don't you have your marker?

65
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,807
Did you really forget
or are you just playing dumb?

66
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,352
That hurts my feelings.

67
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:25,523
I spent all these years
watching you, and only you.

68
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,789
Even after I killed so many people
to send you a message,

69
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,707
NUMBER 10, X? KUMSU CITY
you didn't even blink.

70
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,514
But now,
look what these pictures made you do.

71
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,810
You never had any real emotions
or maternal instincts.

72
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,479
But for a kid that isn't even yours,

73
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,983
you're acting like
you're a loving mother full of emotions.

74
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,196
You're blowing hot and cold.
Maybe you're the real problem.

75
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,074
Enough.

76
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,577
I guess there's no point in talking now.

77
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,000
Attention.

78
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,763
Where's Young-su?

79
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,056
Young-su?

80
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,809
She left to deal with that bastard.

81
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
I have to go.

82
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,024
Didn't you say
you'd die if she told you to?

83
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,319
She told you to stay for a reason.

84
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,701
She told you to sit back and stay alive.

85
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,204
Do as you're told.

86
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,750
Okay?

87
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,156
I'm sorry, Father.

88
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,081
You say I blow hot and cold?

89
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,459
No, I only care about one thing.

90
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,172
I wasn't scared the kids might get hurt.

91
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,677
I was scared they might end up like me.

92
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,639
If I can keep that from happening,

93
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
I'll do anything--

94
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,201
That was so funny I couldn't hold it in.

95
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,539
I guess acting isn't for everyone, huh?

96
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,000
How...

97
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,210
How can you...

98
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,589
<i>Too bad, huh?</i>

99
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,885
<i>It looks like your boyfriend</i>
<i>broke him beyond repair.</i>

100
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,496
You remember now?

101
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,209
Amazing, right?

102
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,588
I can hear you fine with this ear.

103
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,091
But it must be
because this ear is all mangled,

104
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,803
or because I may have awakened my power
thanks to your husband.

105
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,314
Look at this mutt.

106
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,738
He looks all dazed.
I guess your treatment really worked.

107
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,657
Come on.

108
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,246
Your miracle trick works even on dogs.

109
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,916
But why wouldn't it work on me?

110
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,589
Okay.

111
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,094
Now, you have two options.

112
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,224
You can either grab that knife
and come at me right now,

113
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,269
or go sit in that chair without a fight

114
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,064
and tie your hands yourself.

115
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,736
If you go with option number one,
who knows what will happen to my neck?

116
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,536
But I definitely know
this mutt's head will pop like a pinata.

117
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,399
I knew it.

118
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,360
I was right.

119
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,945
You're just like me.

120
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,239
Let Simbok go now.

121
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,082
I noticed something.

122
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,005
You always seem to start
by gagging them with this.

123
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,265
But then again,

124
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,184
I like hearing your voice, to be honest.

125
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,907
Young-su!

126
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,124
Young-su.

127
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,670
You?

128
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,005
I'm sorry.

129
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,176
I was so scared yesterday,
so I had to run.

130
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,180
I am terrified by my mom, you know.

131
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:38,558
What...

132
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,937
But...

133
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,775
I'm terrified by my dad even more.

134
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,618
Damn. I managed to miss the liver,

135
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,412
but I jabbed too deeply
in the heat of the moment.

136
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,248
You... Why?

137
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,961
I heard you cut my dad's ear
back in Special Trainings.

138
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,506
"Ear"?

139
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,762
Anyway, he said
you'd need that before you meet him.

140
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,601
What is this?

141
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,070
MI-OK: GIFT DELIVERED

142
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:36,741
"A well-raised daughter
is worth ten sons."

143
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,119
Guess the saying is true.

144
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,413
Enough nonsense.

145
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,374
Just come over and kill me.

146
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,589
Look.

147
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,885
If my mission was just to kill you,

148
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,724
why would I bother playing a bible-thumper
and calling those scums my family?

149
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,685
See?

150
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,313
I even made this out of respect for you.

151
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,774
This cross represents the number ten.

152
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,449
Then what is it that you want?

153
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,035
What do you think?

154
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,079
It's all about your family matters.

155
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,625
Do you think Mom's okay on her own?

156
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,518
<i>Just because I let you kick some ass,</i>

157
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,729
<i>you didn't think this was over, did you?</i>

158
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,191
Enough with that lame crap.

159
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,068
What do you really want?

160
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,528
<i>You have only two options.</i>

161
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,074
You can come to the arcade
for a Disco Pang Pang showdown,

162
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:03,620
or head to the police station
for a good old school violence report.

163
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,664
You're pissing me off.

164
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,794
Fine. Let's settle this
with Disco Pang Pang, you fuck.

165
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,358
Where's Dad?

166
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:39,781
He had to get his hands dirty,
so he left to find your mom.

167
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,575
And where are you off to?

168
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,828
I'm also about to get my hands...

169
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,872
No, about to share moments of friendship.

170
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,874
Listen, stay here...

171
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,549
If I try to stop you, are you going
to knock me out like your dad did?

172
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,717
No way!

173
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,595
I don't think
you will even try to stop me.

174
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,763
Why's that?

175
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,560
Cause you trust Baek Ji-woo
way more than Baek Chul-hee?

176
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,021
Sure.

177
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,776
You can do some legit damage
on those punk-ass kids.

178
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,780
Fo sho, cuz you're the GOAT!

179
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,456
Control your power.

180
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,583
And why are you going?

181
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,295
Well...

182
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,257
I thought I could be of help,
even if not much.

183
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,217
Look at you.

184
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,555
Such a smooth talker, just like me.

185
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,514
Go on.

186
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,974
Yes, sir!

187
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:52,812
Grandpa.

188
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,942
Do you have anything for me
to share some hardcore friendship?

189
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,528
Wait a second.

190
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,255
Man.

191
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,634
God.

192
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,552
Anyway...

193
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:31,017
let's see if they can really
find salvation in this neighborhood.

194
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,481
What!

195
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,484
That son of a bitch!

196
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:40,443
<i>Don't tell me</i>

197
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:44,114
you forgot all about your mission
to train the kids

198
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,700
and make them awaken their power?

199
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,619
Listen carefully.

200
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,206
If you lay a finger on my kids,

201
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,876
not only you but your kids too will die.

202
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,462
Well then.

203
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:02,924
Let's see
which of us trained the kids better,

204
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:06,094
and whose kids
have truly awakened their powers.

205
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,638
We'll find out.

206
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,815
Good, you both came.

207
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:28,491
- Lucky for me, it's a two-for-one deal.
- What?

208
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,161
Are you freaking out? Don't be.

209
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:32,954
He's just...

210
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:36,166
another keyboard nerd, like you.

211
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,723
What a dumbass.

212
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:56,102
A few tumbles on that ride,
and now he thinks he's hot shit.

213
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:02,609
I'm going to make sure today is
the most pathetic day of your loser life.

214
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,114
If you fight him...

215
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,659
you'll 100% end up killing him.

216
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,120
I'll take him.

217
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,541
I'll control my power.

218
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,463
Just enough to leave him half-dead.

219
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,050
What's with you?

220
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,761
Quit acting tough and get lost.

221
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,222
While you were training with Grandpa,

222
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,933
I was secretly training with Dad.

223
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,310
What? What are you saying?

224
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,778
Say uncle.

225
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,450
Wait!

226
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,332
When fighting a man,
just remember one thing.

227
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,835
Pop one ball, and it's over!

228
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,254
Eyeball or the ball down there.

229
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,964
That's cheating.

230
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,298
What is this, the Olympics?

231
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,801
There's no cheating in killing.

232
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,933
What do you think is the strongest weapon
a human can use?

233
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,728
- A gun?
- Nope.

234
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:20,895
A knife?

235
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,149
It's your hand!

236
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:42,542
The training I got is nothing like yours.

237
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:46,713
My moves may look flashy,

238
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,591
but you're way stronger.

239
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,887
So, don't feel bad about it, okay?

240
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,527
Dumbass.

241
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,030
It doesn't hurt a bit.

242
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:16,826
What can your
soft, computer geek hands possibly do?

243
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,580
I'll tell you what.
I'm going to be a bit rough on you.

244
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,751
You'll be broken and smashed,

245
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,629
but don't worry too much.
I won't kill you.

246
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,382
I'll even let you take the first swing--

247
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:46,648
Fuck!

248
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,775
What the fuck!

249
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,785
Wait, that nerd was the real deal?

250
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,578
That's such a cliché.

251
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,519
Fuck.

252
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,677
Fuck...

253
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,608
Seriously.

254
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,818
I'm on another level--

255
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,535
What a useless bastard.
I told him to stay out of it.

256
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,245
Anyway,

257
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,123
now you're screwed, too.

258
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,753
You said you wanted to see
who was the real bad bitch.

259
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,882
But you don't have the guts
for a fair fight?

260
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,468
Shut your mouth, bitch.

261
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:43,848
If it weren't for Trainings Evaluation,
your neck would've been slashed by now.

262
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:45,308
"Trainings Evaluation"?

263
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,143
What's that?

264
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,439
You came all the way here
and don't even know that?

265
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,817
Between you guys and me,

266
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,945
it's an evaluation
to see who is trained properly,

267
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,156
and who awakened their power.

268
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,119
"Awakened"?

269
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,044
You saw it all, didn't you?

270
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:16,965
Mom has a terrible, dangerous power.

271
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:22,053
But if Ji-woo ever gains
a bad power like me,

272
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,681
you have to stop her
from awakening that power.

273
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,142
Make sure of it.

274
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,478
If I can stop it,

275
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,981
I can also make it happen, right?

276
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,735
Sorry, Ji-woo.

277
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,242
Damn it. What the hell are you doing?

278
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:47,245
I told you I don't have trauma anymore.

279
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,204
Turn it off.

280
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:49,873
You really don't?

281
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:52,459
Damn it.

282
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:54,419
That's not supposed to happen.

283
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,881
You two really are twins.
Dumbasses in sync.

284
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:04,054
Too bad. I was hoping to see
your eyes roll back into your head.

285
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,640
I was told not to kill you.

286
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,560
But guess I can leave
a few scratches on that face.

287
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,273
Get up, bitch.

288
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,859
I'll give you a fair fight,
just as you wanted.

289
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:34,959
I knew it.

290
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:38,713
So you bottle it up,

291
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,383
until you're super pissed off
and you lose it, right?

292
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,301
Perfect.

293
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:47,597
Now we'll see who the real bitch is.

294
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:33,810
Bitch!

295
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,106
Shit!

296
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,810
Ji-woo!

297
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,235
You didn't kill anyone yet.

298
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:28,573
So...

299
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,660
you're a good daughter, whatever they say.

300
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:47,676
Just kill me, you bitch.

301
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:51,554
What?

302
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,515
You don't think you can?

303
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,395
It's not that I can't kill you.

304
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,564
I just won't.

305
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:23,336
Call him.

306
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,588
Call your daddy and tell on me.

307
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:32,929
JAE-GON: TRAININGS EVALUATION FAILED

308
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,894
What could the kids possibly learn
from someone like you?

309
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,275
Fortunately, I guess
my kids didn't kill them.

310
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,110
You should be grateful.

311
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,413
Are you seriously not scared of anything?

312
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:12,552
You really are just like me, aren't you?

313
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,523
Sorry, no appointments today.
Everyone's out on house calls.

314
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,738
But this is the only place
that will treat me.

315
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,490
Then I'll wait.

316
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:48,672
By the way...

317
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:51,716
what's with that cuff?

318
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,594
- It's not an ankle monitor.
- This?

319
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,721
I made this.

320
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,891
You can't open it without a key.

321
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:04,729
Anyway, where's the patient?

322
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,607
My boy, who is cute as a bunny.

323
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,902
And my wife, clever as a fox.

324
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:13,655
And...

325
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,492
Damn, this rush is insane.

326
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:21,287
If not for this,
I'd have crossed the Jordan ages ago.

327
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,291
So, your whole family
is a pack of filthy animals.

328
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,837
I guess you came
to the right kind of hospital.

329
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:30,797
Old-timer.

330
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:34,843
Before I bury you,
let me ask you one thing.

331
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:40,724
Is that crazy bitch
your daughter or daughter-in-law?

332
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,018
Both.

333
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,310
"Both"?

334
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,857
So the husband of that bitch
who throws a mean punch

335
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,191
is both your son and your son-in-law?

336
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:53,570
- That's right.
- Oh, I see.

337
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:57,699
So today...

338
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,828
you'll lose your son, daughter,
your in-laws and two grandkids...

339
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,204
Wait, no.

340
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:08,335
You'll lose that mutt, too.
All seven of them.

341
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,673
Oh, yeah? Then let me ask you something.

342
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:18,094
Are you a jellyfish or a stingray?

343
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,723
Who the hell do you think
you're calling a jellyfish?

344
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,309
I'm a stingray.

345
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,025
A jellyfish is basically
just water, no guts, nothing at all.

346
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,569
And balls?

347
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,446
They don't have any.

348
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:37,906
On the other hand,

349
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,367
a stingray?

350
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,911
Now they've got two dicks.

351
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:44,662
Two.

352
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,207
That's right.

353
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,126
That's why I'm a real stingray.

354
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,463
So, I came here today,

355
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:57,300
packing double. You fuck!

356
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:06,559
What?

357
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:12,774
Attention.

358
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,111
Come on. You know that doesn't work on me.

359
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:19,239
Attention!

360
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,304
Shit, stupid mutt!

361
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,559
You fucking dog.

362
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,520
Die!

363
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,314
Die, you damn dog!

364
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,943
This was not what you wanted, right?

365
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,198
You just wanted to prove
you were better than me.

366
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:07,245
I already proved that a long time ago.

367
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:11,166
You think you've won
just because my trick didn't work on you?

368
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,376
No.

369
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,338
You didn't even come close to copying me.

370
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,672
"Copying you"?

371
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,342
Why the hell would I copy you?

372
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:24,387
You put together a family of scums,
playing pastor and dad.

373
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,097
Wasn't that to copy me?

374
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,809
You want to be me.

375
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,771
So you've been imitating me all along.

376
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,360
Do you have a death wish?

377
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:43,531
Can you even hit me from there?

378
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:45,867
Come closer.

379
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:48,745
One headshot would do, right?

380
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,996
No.

381
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:53,083
I'll never kill you with one clean shot.

382
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,836
The longer the pain, the better--

383
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,935
What the fuck.

384
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:19,609
So

385
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:24,656
why do people say "stingray dick"
to mean something useless?

386
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,199
What?

387
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:30,787
Because female stingrays
are far pricier and taste better,

388
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,082
but male stingrays are worthless

389
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:38,211
with their double dicks.

390
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:42,340
So when the fishermen catch them,
out of spite,

391
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:44,217
they cut their dicks off.

392
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,141
Not bad, old man.

393
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,103
Were you a badass back in the day?

394
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,396
You bet.

395
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:03,153
I used to cross the 38th parallel,
from Pyeongyang to Wonsan,

396
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:05,822
having my share of fun.

397
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:14,247
Then, what have you been fiddling with
in there, huh?

398
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,364
Come on.

399
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,284
Jellyfish or stingray,

400
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:56,915
you should've walked away
when your wife went down.

401
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:01,002
Then you would have at least kept one dick.

402
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,672
You son of a bitch.

403
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:07,467
<i>Pain?</i>

404
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:12,722
What do you know about pain?

405
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,309
You're afraid mom would scold you
if you killed me.

406
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,937
You're shaking in your boots.
Don't play tough.

407
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,594
Young-su, I'm sorry.

408
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:52,887
I'm so late.

409
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,348
- Something happened on the way--
- Why?

410
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,601
I told you not to come.

411
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:02,397
I know. But I have something to give you.

412
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,484
I decided to stand by you from now on.

413
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,820
"Stand by you"?

414
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:12,365
It looks like
you can barely stand on your own.

415
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,754
Can you handle this?

416
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,673
I don't even remember you.

417
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,385
But you never forgot me, right?

418
00:42:37,265 --> 00:42:39,225
I'm fine. Patch yourself up, first.

419
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,520
It's your turn to lose an ear.

420
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:06,878
Are you sure you can handle this?

421
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,881
You should use that as a weapon.

422
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:11,216
I'm good.

423
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:14,219
I'm planning to take off your other ear...

424
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:18,098
with my bare hands.

425
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:43,808
Originally, I was going to gouge
out your eyes.

426
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:49,898
But then, you won't be able to...

427
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:53,610
watch your pathetic ending.

428
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:19,260
Let me tell you something.

429
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:24,599
In this place,

430
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,021
I'm the commander of Special Trainings,
and God the Father himself.

431
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,869
You can't die on me already.

432
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:48,998
Didn't you say
you'd stand by your wife's side?

433
00:46:09,728 --> 00:46:12,605
I'm coming to you.

434
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:29,372
I'm sorry, Young-su.

435
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:36,171
I guess
this is the end of the line for me.

436
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:44,888
Okay.

437
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,515
It's enough.

438
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,230
Enough, my ass.

439
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,198
No.

440
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:08,411
I've made it this far.
There's no way I'm ending it like this.

441
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,733
If you die too soon without pain,

442
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,319
it would be such a shame.

443
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:50,620
I've come a long way
following the path of the cross.

444
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,832
So I deserve a grand finale,
don't you think?

445
00:47:59,045 --> 00:48:00,672
It'll be a bland finale.

446
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:04,426
What?

447
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,262
What did you just say?

448
00:48:11,641 --> 00:48:13,059
I said

449
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,395
it will be a bland finale.

450
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:26,156
What the hell?

451
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:48,887
Young-su.

452
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:55,143
I guess
this is the end of the line for me.

453
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,361
Okay.

454
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,030
It's enough.

455
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,703
Enough, my ass.

456
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,970
Now can you hear me loud and clear?

457
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:35,392
Attention, for real this time.

458
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:44,317
Release me.

459
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,390
Thanks.

460
00:50:16,474 --> 00:50:19,144
I never understood feelings
like anger or fear.

461
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:22,939
But thanks to you, now I do.

462
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:29,863
It means I can really dedicate myself
to making you feel pain.

463
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,926
Don't die on me yet.

464
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:35,178
I made sure your eyes were intact.

465
00:51:37,305 --> 00:51:39,224
You need to watch

466
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:43,228
the path of the cross
crumble into something utterly pathetic.

467
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,712
You're just going to end it like this?

468
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,797
If I were you,

469
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,468
I'd use your miracle trick
to hurt me even more.

470
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:19,014
No, I'm not like you.

471
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:24,853
Whatever horrible hell I put in your head,
it won't come close to all of your sins.

472
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:30,025
It's a shame, but I'll settle
for sending you to a literal hell.

473
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:31,609
Stop.

474
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:37,490
Don't do it, please.

475
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:53,673
He's not worth all the bad karma.

476
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:08,188
For your kid's sake.

477
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:40,970
Young-su. I'm sorry.

478
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,432
My beautiful Young-su.

479
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:48,436
I promised...

480
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,732
I promised to protect you.

481
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:58,863
I could handle this
only because you stood by my side.

482
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,758
<i>Young-hee...</i>

483
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,679
<i>When we get out of here and live together,</i>

484
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:26,307
<i>I'll buy you a real hairpin,</i>
<i>even prettier than this.</i>

485
00:54:26,725 --> 00:54:27,726
<i>Really?</i>

486
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:30,562
<i>You'll live with me?</i>

487
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,981
<i>Like a real family?</i>

488
00:54:33,064 --> 00:54:33,982
<i>Yeah.</i>

489
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,817
<i>Like a real family.</i>

490
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,570
<i>Okay. Then...</i>

491
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,281
Attention.

492
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:51,583
To protect Young-hee,
Chul-su will do anything!

493
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,544
<i>Got it.</i>

494
00:54:55,378 --> 00:54:57,130
<i>From now on,</i>

495
00:54:57,964 --> 00:55:01,468
<i>to protect Young-hee,</i>
<i>Chul-su will do anything.</i>

496
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,511
<i>I promise.</i>

497
00:55:29,954 --> 00:55:32,582
Are you disappointed
things didn't go your way?

498
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:38,588
No. I mean...

499
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:42,967
Yeah. I'm disappointed.

500
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:50,308
Ever since I was a kid,
whenever I got pissed, I'd see red.

501
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,645
Looking back,
I think I blamed Mom for that.

502
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:59,484
But now I think she's the reason
I could control myself at all.

503
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,115
So that's what it was.

504
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,576
Now what Mom said makes sense.

505
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:13,081
Dude, don't feel too bad.

506
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:16,501
Whenever I lose it,
it's you who brings me back.

507
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:18,169
Come here!

508
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:19,629
Hey, it hurts!

509
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,197
Screw it. I'm tired, too.

510
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,780
Damn it.

511
00:57:27,822 --> 00:57:29,366
Moving in.

512
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:32,911
What happened?

513
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,455
Detective Kang, are you okay?

514
00:57:35,538 --> 00:57:37,832
- Just go inside.
- Yes, sir.

515
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,835
Your jaw's popping out of place.

516
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:44,381
What, did you and Doom-veloper
have an all-night brawl?

517
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:48,677
I got stabbed as soon as I got here
and spent the night passed out,

518
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:50,887
but I'm still tired.

519
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:54,683
So, it's the animal hospital again?

520
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:58,561
No.

521
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:02,315
That bastard,

522
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:04,984
<i>he did that himself.</i>

523
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:08,196
<i>They were not here.</i>

524
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:20,667
Father! Look at this blood!

525
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:23,712
Not mine.

526
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:30,885
I need to clean this up
before the paramedics arrive.

527
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,889
Wait. When did I kill him?

528
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,184
I only killed Number 11.

529
00:58:38,268 --> 00:58:40,729
You didn't kill Number 11, either.

530
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,481
Really? Right.

531
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:48,653
This must be a dream. We must be dreaming.

532
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:51,948
Lame. We're not dreaming.

533
00:58:52,365 --> 00:58:54,159
Not dreaming? Are you sure?

534
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:58,329
But what's with all this blood?

535
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:00,790
That's your blood, Dad.

536
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,585
What? Ouch!

537
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,634
But it's weird.

538
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:14,637
I'm not in pain.

539
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,599
I just feel hungry, you know?

540
00:59:17,682 --> 00:59:20,185
You're such a blockhead.

541
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,023
Your guts are full of holes.

542
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:27,901
Of course you feel your belly is empty.

543
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,197
But...

544
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:34,866
I'm hungry, too.

545
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:36,534
Same.

546
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:39,871
Mom. Can you cook something?

547
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:44,167
Okay, let me cook something.

548
00:59:47,671 --> 00:59:48,880
I'm starving.

549
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:45,937
<i>How've you been, my girl?</i>

550
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,244
I told Number 11 that you were different.

551
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:04,456
<i>That however he tried to copy you,</i>
<i>he'd never measure up.</i>

552
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,166
<i>I told him this over and over again.</i>

553
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:11,296
But I guess it literally fell
on deaf ears, at least one of them.

554
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:17,761
Anyway, I guess the family matters
are all in order according to the plan.

555
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,638
PAWFECT HAVEN ANIMAL HOSPITAL

556
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:24,726
"All in order according to the plan"?

557
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:29,022
You brutely slaughtered people
just to catch me.

558
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:32,567
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I wasn't trying to catch you.</i>

559
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,403
<i>I never let you out of my sight.</i>

560
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:56,633
<i>That's right.</i>

561
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,468
The truth is...

562
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:02,389
so much closer than you think.

563
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:05,809
"TRUTH" IN MIRROR
IS CLOSER THAN IT APPEARS

564
01:02:06,976 --> 01:02:08,853
What are you talking about?

565
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,522
<i>I'm saying that everything...</i>

566
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,109
has been a plan you thought of
from the beginning.

567
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,863
<i>Our real "family matters."</i>

568
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:51,618
