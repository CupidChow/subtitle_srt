1
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,611
Mun, don't try to do anything on your own.

2
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,613
You may end up getting hurt

3
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,781
and losing the host.

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,449
Brace yourself.

5
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,285
It's totally different
from that kid's dad.

6
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,662
Today is your field training.

7
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,247
Don't do anything.

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
What did I tell you?

9
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,210
That once I get on the field,

10
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,003
I may either end up dying

11
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,088
or killing someone.

12
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,806
But I practiced my control a lot.

13
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,599
-Listen to Ha-na.
-Listen to Ha-na.

14
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,768
Okay.

15
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,738
This is it. He tread upon this territory.

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,200
That means he's out of our territory now.

17
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,326
How do we find him?

18
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,330
We have to, even if that means
going through every house.

19
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,581
Of course, we should.

20
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,583
He ran after a kid with a weapon.

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm sure they were acquainted.

22
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,049
Mr. Han, what do you think is for dinner?
Take a guess.

23
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,261
And a close acquaintance.
She wanted to eat dinner with him.

24
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,804
She wasn't wary of him.

25
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,807
The man is about 180 cm tall,
wearing a checkered shirt.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,309
The girl, a Gyeongjin Junior High uniform.

27
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,936
Any other leads?

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,273
No. We just know they went this way.

29
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,316
Man, this is a huge area.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
We won't find them until tomorrow.

31
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,279
What's the weapon
that the evil spirit had?

32
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,905
-A chisel.
-A chisel?

33
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,700
-What's a chisel?
-It's used to break stones.

34
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,373
SEARCH FOR: STONEMASON

35
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,624
Sinwang Stonemasonry.

36
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,502
There's a stonemasonry company.

37
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,257
SINWANG STONEMASONRY

38
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,268
Ms. Chu, block off the entrance
with the car.

39
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,185
Okay, I will.

40
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,228
-Be careful.
-Go.

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,981
SINWANG STONEMASONRY

42
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,778
SINWANG STONEMASONRY

43
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,033
I can't hear a thing
because of that machine.

44
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,409
It's all right.

45
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,287
Mun, be on standby right here.
Call if anything happens.

46
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,222
Mr. Han, why are you doing this?

47
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,477
What did I ever do wrong?
At least tell me the reason.

48
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,731
Why do I need a reason
to kill a man like you?

49
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,359
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,489
You cut stone for a living
in this hillbilly town.

51
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,866
You're all penniless and in debt.

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,409
So what's still making you laugh?

53
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,036
Hey, are you feeling great?

54
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,580
Are you happy?

55
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,709
Please spare us.

56
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,463
We just welcomed you
as a new member of our company,

57
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,217
so we just wanted to have
some good beef with you.

58
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,802
Did I ask you to buy me beef?

59
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,304
Did I? Did I say that?

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,973
Did I?

61
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,035
Hey.

62
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,151
Wow.

63
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,764
Please spare us.

64
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,185
Please spare our lives.

65
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,980
Now, that's much better.

66
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,734
You finally look unhappy.

67
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,778
You jerk.

68
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,156
You've gone completely insane.

69
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,076
That's enough. Time for you to go.

70
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,641
Hey, he's right here.
Hurry up and come over.

71
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,518
Mun!

72
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,234
Stop moving, please.
Just give us a moment.

73
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,737
Where, Mun?

74
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,865
It's the warehouse!
The big one on the right side!

75
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,118
The warehouse?

76
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,539
Where's the warehouse?

77
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,463
This is nice…

78
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,549
-Hello.
-Have a great day.

79
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,593
Seriously.

80
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,227
Get off me.

81
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:20,940
How…

82
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,652
Hello.

83
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,320
Thank you.

84
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,864
Bang.

85
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,324
How could you do that? How?

86
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,506
Mun, you aren't hurt, are you?

87
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,967
Why won't you say anything?
Will you please answer her?

88
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,386
You.

89
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,597
Darn it.

90
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
Mun.

91
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,103
Are you okay? Pull yourself together!

92
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,856
We told you to be on standby.

93
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,819
That way.

94
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,573
He took the girl with him.

95
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,617
Just sit right there.

96
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,412
She might die.

97
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,249
Ms. Chu, we need you here quickly.
The victims are in critical condition.

98
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,169
Yes. Hey!

99
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,378
Darn it.

100
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,172
Mo-tak, Mun just went after you.

101
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,341
I'll join you once Ms. Chu comes.

102
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,680
Where is he? Where is that jerk?

103
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,350
Don't lose your cool.

104
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,434
He might hear you.

105
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,103
Okay.

106
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,480
Do you see the tallest pagoda?

107
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,648
The tallest pagoda?

108
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,532
I do.

109
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,534
Can you go up without getting noticed?

110
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,620
I'll try.

111
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,293
Okay.

112
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,850
I found him.

113
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,435
Where is he?

114
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,063
Way inside, where the stones are kept.

115
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,031
Ha-na!

116
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,869
You need to go.

117
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,458
What?

118
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,879
Mo-tak, you need to hurry.

119
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,553
Whoa.

120
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,188
Who's this?

121
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,369
Who are you jerks?

122
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,045
Mun, get that jerk.

123
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,160
Please.

124
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,761
The territory is here.

125
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,648
Whoa.

126
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,381
Hey, man.

127
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,853
-What are you doing, you punk? Stop that!
-Mun, no!

128
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,940
You can't kill him!

129
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,214
You. Come here.

130
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,426
Why?

131
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,513
Is he dead?

132
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,724
What happened?

133
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,895
Mun got him.

134
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,318
You almost killed him, punk.

135
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,169
Mun, since you caught him,
you can summon them to Yung.

136
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,466
So there's an evil spirit

137
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,010
in this man.

138
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,387
Yes, you saw it last time.

139
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,848
What will happen to him now?

140
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,101
The shell, his body, will stay here
and be punished by the law.

141
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,437
You just need to summon
the evil spirit in him

142
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,980
and the souls of the people

143
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,524
that the evil spirit ate.

144
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,985
-How many souls are being held captive?
-Two.

145
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,615
I saw them too.
They lived in my neighborhood.

146
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,325
-Hello. Have a great day.
-Hello.

147
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,202
The couple who went missing
on a hiking trail.

148
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,998
It must've been shocking.

149
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,833
He killed them.

150
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,460
I saw him do it.

151
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,090
What do I do now?

152
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,134
It's similar to how you get to Yung.

153
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,595
Put this jerk's hand on his chest,

154
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,014
and put your right hand over his.

155
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,808
Escort them properly

156
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,228
on their way to the afterlife.

157
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,135
What do you want?

158
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,390
According to Yung's strict law and order,

159
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:38,228
I hereby extradite the criminal
to the judicial authorities.

160
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,522
What kind of bullshit is this?

161
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,529
You asshole.

162
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,865
I'm going to find you again
and end your life!

163
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,043
No!

164
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:10,094
Those who flee from the afterlife
are to be judged immediately

165
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,804
without a chance to explain.

166
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,396
To the eternal prison.

167
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,498
Darn it.

168
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,751
Where the heck am I?

169
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,676
Why is it so dark here?

170
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,554
I can't see a thing.

171
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
What? What is this?

172
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,822
Darn it.

173
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,200
Ugh, damn it.

174
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,578
Hey!

175
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,374
Let me go!

176
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,604
Where…

177
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,940
are we?

178
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,109
Honey.

179
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,652
I think…

180
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,446
we came to the afterlife.

181
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,454
Yes.

182
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,331
You two…

183
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,000
passed away

184
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,628
on October 7th, 2019, at 10:28 a.m.

185
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,714
I see. Is that so?

186
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:58,303
I am your guide to the afterlife.

187
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,354
Did you die too?

188
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,898
You're such a young and lovely boy.
What happened?

189
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,483
I didn't…

190
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,486
This is the Grim Reaper

191
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,446
who escorted you here.

192
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,033
Goodness, so there are such beings.

193
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,328
I'm sorry.

194
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,789
You shouldn't be sorry.

195
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,209
We couldn't live or die all this time,

196
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,586
so it was agonizing.

197
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,050
I look forward to seeing
more good work from you.

198
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,931
Please follow me.

199
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,563
Thank you.

200
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,694
Wait, one second.

201
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,241
Young man.

202
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,868
Could you do me a favor?

203
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,703
Pardon?

204
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,542
Oh, man.
Is this little punk playing cards in Yung?

205
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,835
Why won't he come back?

206
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,961
-Okay.
-Yes?

207
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,298
Let's say that guy
was about to hurt his family.

208
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,424
-Okay.
-Yes.

209
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,010
Then the dad ended up
saving his family dramatically.

210
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,094
-Let's go with that.
-Okay.

211
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,512
How should we lay them out?

212
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,847
Come this way.

213
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,641
Over here. Give me a hand.

214
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,188
Are you back? You're heavy. Get off me.

215
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,735
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,238
For what?

217
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,659
I couldn't control my emotions back there.

218
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,413
Do you know what happens
when the host dies?

219
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,667
Not only does the evil spirit vanish,

220
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,377
the souls it had can't go
to the afterlife,

221
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,711
and they vanish forever.

222
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,589
And you'd go to prison for homicide.

223
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,132
It makes you angry.

224
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,136
You saw his atrocious murder,
so of course, you got angry.

225
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,722
But that's our job.

226
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,101
You need to learn to control

227
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,312
your anger and sadness.

228
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,897
Okay?

229
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,191
Okay.

230
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,569
It's fine.

231
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,446
Great work.

232
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,994
CALLING 112

233
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,461
He's the suspect.

234
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,548
It's not that he became a bad guy
because of the evil spirit.

235
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,135
Evil spirits only go into people
who are already wicked.

236
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
There's a frequency to bloodthirstiness.

237
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,057
Evil spirits look for that sound
to find a host.

238
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,600
I see.

239
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,770
Team One, let's move out.
Everything is over. Let's go.

240
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,733
My mom and dad were police officers too.

241
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,819
-Really?
-Yes.

242
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,364
They worked at Nambu Police Agency.
For the Intellectual Crime Squad.

243
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,117
What's your dad's name?

244
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,038
His name is Mr. So Gwon.

245
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,291
So Gwon.

246
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,379
-His name is So Gwon?
-Yes.

247
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,006
Why?

248
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,676
Mun, that was such a proper way
to share your father's name.

249
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,053
Who taught you so well?

250
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,929
My grandfather.

251
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,019
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE

252
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,481
We're done here.

253
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,483
Let's have some rice soup on our way back.

254
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,693
We have to stop by somewhere.

255
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,906
You can't do that.

256
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,868
Our identity may be exposed
if we intervene with the living.

257
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,330
If we start doing favors for the deceased,
they'll keep asking for more.

258
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,084
I just need to share a few words
with their daughter.

259
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,168
Be quiet.

260
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,795
Yung won't allow it.

261
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,089
What are you going to say?

262
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,801
"Hey, your parents died a year ago,
then they finally got to the afterlife,

263
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,761
and they have something to tell you"?

264
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,557
I'm going to tell her.

265
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,309
-Sheesh.
-What did you say?

266
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,977
She hands out flyers

267
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,105
as she desperately looks for them.

268
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,689
They parted without any warning.

269
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,234
They said they had
one last thing to tell her.

270
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,777
I'll go.

271
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,154
Why are you getting into this?

272
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,074
Don't worry. I won't cause any trouble.

273
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,034
I said no!

274
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,138
SEVEN YEARS AGO

275
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,028
You were brain-dead.

276
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,739
It's odd for me to say this as a doctor,

277
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,535
but this is impossible.

278
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:18,039
Doctor, I don't remember anything.

279
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,209
What's the last thing you can recall?

280
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,887
How long have I been hospitalized?

281
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,473
You first came in on October 24th.

282
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,060
I was in bed for seven months?

283
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,271
Will I ever get my memory back?

284
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,565
I can't tell you for sure.

285
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,150
It might come back tomorrow,

286
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,902
or it may never come back.

287
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,074
I need to find out who this is.

288
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,743
What are you going to do?

289
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,912
What do you think?

290
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,623
I'll get them back.

291
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,042
They can't mess with a detective.

292
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,628
You've been contracted as a Counter.

293
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,631
Excuse me.

294
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,634
Who have you been talking to?

295
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,427
The afterlife.

296
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,305
Man, where's my phone?

297
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,478
"So Gwon"?

298
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,815
Who's So Gwon?

299
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,377
SO GWON

300
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,670
What's your dad's name?

301
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,755
His name is Mr. So Gwon.

302
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,916
Are you sleepy? Should I drive?

303
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,668
I just needed to get some air.

304
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,337
-You can go back to sleep.
-I'm fine.

305
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,382
I'm up. I had a good sleep.

306
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,015
I should've told him before.

307
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,102
It must've shocked him
to see someone get murdered.

308
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,895
It must've been awfully scary.

309
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,482
Who knew he'd read them so quickly?

310
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,028
I should've told him before.

311
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,905
Then he could've been ready to face it.

312
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,950
Gosh, my dear Ms. Chu. You've grown old.

313
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,202
You keep saying the same thing
again and again.

314
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,537
Like someone with dementia?

315
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,001
Is it because he's young?

316
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,545
Mun learns very fast.

317
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,443
They're dead. All taken care of.

318
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,832
Everyone at school seems to know.

319
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:48,917
You're here.

320
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,086
You're here.

321
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,922
Why are you so late?

322
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,759
But he's unbelievably strong.

323
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,928
It felt like I was being hit
with a hammer.

324
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,097
What a lame excuse
for getting your ass kicked.

325
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,348
He's serious.

326
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,849
You know how good Hyeok-u is.

327
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,436
Hey.

328
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,774
If you can't fight him one-on-one,

329
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,776
just beat him up as a group and kill him.

330
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,653
And you kick his friend's ass, too.

331
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,366
I heard there's a girl, too.
What's that about?

332
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,285
So, what should you do now?

333
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,538
Huh?

334
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,456
Do you know or don't you, you idiots?

335
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,749
-We do.
-We do.

336
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,086
Hey.

337
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,047
Greet your senior when you see him, okay?

338
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,386
Is your neck still stiff from his punch?

339
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,938
Man, this rich-ass kid.

340
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,401
Do you want me to get revenge for you?

341
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,364
I don't care about getting into college,

342
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,200
but I need to get a job at Taesin.

343
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,913
It'd be great if you told them
there's a guy who can get work done.

344
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,334
Your dad is practically
Taesin Group itself.

345
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,133
Are you up for it?

346
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,820
No way.

347
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,863
Who's that?

348
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,657
Isn't that Mun?

349
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,659
-Let me see.
-Whoa, hey.

350
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,786
Mun?

351
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,544
Exactly, I asked you to give it to me
in a hurry.

352
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,337
Then just for two months.

353
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,464
Didn't I tell you it's urgent?

354
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,841
Didn't I tell you?

355
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,592
Didn't I? Hey.

356
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,971
-Ouch.
-What are you doing right now?

357
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,139
Didn't you hear from the seniors?

358
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,016
I'll kill you if you bully other kids.

359
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,686
Hey, it's that jerk
who beat up the sophomores.

360
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,687
What?

361
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,441
Why do you have three backpacks?

362
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,527
Oh, I…

363
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,280
Give us our bags, Hyo-cheol.

364
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,408
Why do you always lose
at rock-paper-scissors?

365
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,450
Come on, man.

366
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,548
If you bully your classmates again,
I'll do that to you next time.

367
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,341
Got it?

368
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,219
Run along.

369
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:37,395
Did you tell your teacher that
they take your money and beat you?

370
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,440
Well, I…

371
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,441
Tell your teacher.

372
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,318
And keep doing it.

373
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,529
Even if they don't get punished,
keep saying it.

374
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,157
And report them to the police.

375
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,993
Leave evidence to show people
that you've been bullied.

376
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,037
Ung-min, you too.

377
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,038
Okay.

378
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,790
And you, Mun.

379
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,791
What?

380
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,838
What?

381
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,883
-Come here.
-Ouch, what is it?

382
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,428
What happened?

383
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,471
What?

384
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,848
You couldn't beat Ju-yeon up
until junior high.

385
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,184
So how did you end up taking them down?

386
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,687
-Like I told you, I just put out my fist--
-Fist, my ass.

387
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,316
Don't lie to us. Since we were five,
we've been like siblings.

388
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,026
Our fingers and toes grew together,

389
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,571
I heard your voices change,
and we had cake after my first period.

390
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,739
We share everything.

391
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,990
We saw you run too.

392
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,743
What happened to you?

393
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,828
Goodness.

394
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,044
What if I said I fixed my leg
with that vibranium--

395
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,504
-Hey!
-Please!

396
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,215
Could you just believe me?

397
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,842
The story of the webtoon we drew
when we were younger

398
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,344
became a reality for me.

399
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,429
Could you just let it go at that?

400
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,016
It's because I can't tell you.

401
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,645
Something this huge happened to me,
but I can't tell you.

402
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,022
I know we've never had any secrets at all,

403
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,108
but I still can't tell you anything.

404
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,070
But can you walk now?

405
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,781
Did we see that right?

406
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,534
Yes.

407
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,453
Hey, let us see you walk.

408
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,728
He can really walk.

409
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,362
-Keep going.
-Keep walking.

410
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,118
You punk…

411
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,162
I'll believe him.

412
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,414
What more do we need?

413
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,332
You can walk now.

414
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:09,839
You should've told us first.

415
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,467
You are the first to know.

416
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,052
And you're the only ones.

417
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,679
I wanted to run with you,
play ball with you,

418
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,223
and do all kinds of things together.

419
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,684
But I couldn't say anything
for the last seven years.

420
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,104
-We can do everything now.
-Is this real?

421
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
-Stop crying.
-Mun.

422
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,607
Hey.

423
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,235
Hey.

424
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,321
You can't tell anyone about this.

425
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,364
-We won't.
-We won't tell, you punk.

426
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,450
-We're brothers, man.
-You're my brother.

427
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,830
What did you want to do with me?

428
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,373
Well, first off…

429
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,877
Never mind. Later.
I'll tell you after school.

430
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,212
Hey, it's him.

431
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,630
He beat Hyeok-u?

432
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,048
Yes, I saw him do it.

433
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,299
He's never even talked.

434
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,801
I was so shocked.

435
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,010
-Seriously?
-Gosh.

436
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,346
It was easier when you were a nobody.

437
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,056
-You got your feet confused.
-Me?

438
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,390
-No, before.
-Okay.

439
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,558
It's confusing.

440
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,146
Line up, okay?

441
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,780
Where's yours? What about you?

442
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,990
All of you.

443
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,159
You idiots!

444
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
Didn't you do your job?

445
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,957
I kept saying you're cute,
then you got cheeky

446
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,125
and began to slack off.

447
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,129
Weren't the freshmen
supposed to pay me yesterday?

448
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,923
Did you keep it for yourself?

449
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,759
No! We were going to pay up today.

450
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,388
-But that jerk got in the way.
-What?

451
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,099
That jerk who beat up Hyeok-u.

452
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,058
Hey, rookies.

453
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,644
Come here.

454
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,313
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

455
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,066
Do you quit your job
when someone's in the way?

456
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,318
No, we don't.

457
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,403
We have to do it.

458
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,869
A person must get their job done
to make a living.

459
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,705
Got it?

460
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,460
He messed with my finances?

461
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,104
Who's So Mun?

462
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,025
I'm So Mun.

463
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,744
What is this?

464
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,997
Are you kidding me?

465
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,711
Come to the cafeteria storage room
after school today.

466
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,506
Why?

467
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,179
"Why"?

468
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,851
Listen to this kid. He just asked us why.

469
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,732
Tell me why I should be there…

470
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,444
I've heard of how reckless you are,

471
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,904
but you must be insane!

472
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,968
You jerk!

473
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,369
Who's the strongest?

474
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,835
Can I put an end to this once I beat you?

475
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,462
Can we

476
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,091
all come to school without getting scared?

477
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,179
You crazy asshole!

478
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,951
-Is he down?
-Damn it.

479
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,707
Take your friends and go.

480
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,710
Don't make them take money
from other kids.

481
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,212
Don't ever…

482
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,840
hit anyone.

483
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,343
And don't ever…

484
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,013
threaten anyone at school from now on.

485
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,412
What is this?

486
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,081
What happened?

487
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,709
It happened so quickly,
so I couldn't tell what he did.

488
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,045
How does this make sense?

489
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,550
He's not a bad fighter. I give him that.

490
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,720
But I can't be humiliated.

491
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,765
We should die before we get humiliated.

492
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,517
Isn't that so, you idiots?

493
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,729
Even if you die, you should die
only after you beat that asshole.

494
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,775
Is that a smile?

495
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,280
"If you can't do it one-on-one,
kill him as a group.

496
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,619
And kick his friend's ass, too.

497
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,038
And if there's a girl…"

498
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,917
That's what you said we should do.

499
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,628
This doesn't feel right.

500
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,761
Give me his information.

501
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,265
Be careful.

502
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,392
Put your foot back up.

503
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,893
-Foot up.
-Whoa!

504
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,395
-No.
-Hey, watch out.

505
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,439
Put your foot up there. Up there.

506
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,233
Hey, I did it. It's working.

507
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,651
-Good.
-It's working.

508
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,445
-Don't let me go.
-I won't.

509
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,155
-Don't let go.
-I won't. I won't let go.

510
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,281
Hey.

511
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,074
-You didn't let go, right?
-No.

512
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,409
-You let go!
-I didn't!

513
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,869
You can do this already.

514
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,829
-I did it!
-It's a race to the market.

515
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,706
The loser buys ice cream.

516
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,249
Hey, wait for me!

517
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm broke.

518
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,878
-Wait for me!
-Hey!

519
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,629
Hey!

520
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,143
Mun, are you okay?

521
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,355
Breathe in and out. You need to breathe.

522
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,486
Use this.

523
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,739
I'm fine.

524
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,781
Are you okay?

525
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,824
Are you back?

526
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,075
Yes, I'm back.

527
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,827
Are you sure?

528
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,537
Yes.

529
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:40,873
Get up.

530
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,376
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

531
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm fine.

532
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,258
EONNI'S NOODLES

533
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,764
Did Mun say

534
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,975
his parents died in a car accident?

535
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,352
That's what he said.

536
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,145
And that's when he hurt his leg.

537
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,941
And that was seven years ago, right?

538
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,817
Why?

539
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,195
It might not have been an accident.

540
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,535
-What?
-I read into his memory.

541
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:25,960
If it wasn't…

542
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,712
A fabricated accident. Homicide.

543
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,802
Elaborate.

544
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,640
He was barely conscious,
so it's not for sure.

545
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,183
They're dead. All taken care of.

546
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,686
"They're dead. All taken care of."

547
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,355
-That's what he said.
-Are you sure?

548
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,982
Yes, I heard it clearly.

549
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:51,193
That man who hit them
did it to take Mun's parents' lives.

550
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,195
It wasn't just "that man,"
it's "those men."

551
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,115
There's the guy who said,
"All taken care of."

552
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,783
And the other one who heard that.

553
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,203
He's gone.

554
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,664
You'll leave traces.

555
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,292
You're right. There were two men.

556
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,585
Did you see their faces?

557
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,212
No, Mun lost his consciousness,
so nothing after that.

558
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,339
Man, what's happening here?

559
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,092
Do you know the date?

560
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,760
Was there a clock or something?

561
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,845
So, what if she does?

562
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,847
I wanted to look into it.

563
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,059
Shin Myeong-hwi won the election
for mayor of Jungjin.

564
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
The mayoral election.

565
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,356
I heard an update for the count
on the radio.

566
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,316
Mayoral election.

567
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:31,900
One second.

568
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,862
2013 mayoral election.

569
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,113
2013 MAYORAL ELECTION

570
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,240
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH, 2013

571
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,577
How long have I been hospitalized?

572
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,912
You first came in on October 24th.

573
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,247
OCTOBER 24TH, 2013

574
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,168
Ms. Chu, that kid and I both fell
into a coma on the same day.

575
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,712
-What?
-What?

576
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,674
Mun's parents and I got into an accident
on the same day.

577
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,217
October 24th, 2013.

578
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,427
What did you say?

579
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,471
It's a bit too uncanny to call this…

580
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,513
A coincidence.

581
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,224
I need to go out.

582
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,225
Wait.

583
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:09,688
Don't share what we just said
with Mun. Both of you.

584
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,942
EONNI'S NOODLES

585
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,365
Wow, the old man got a new car again.

586
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,953
Man.

587
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,874
The sky is stunningly blue.

588
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,673
Your new car has a scary engine sound.

589
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,007
Dying to get to the afterlife?

590
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,218
I can't take my money

591
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,719
when I pass on to the afterlife.

592
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,970
I need to use it up.

593
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:42,888
May I have coffee?

594
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,183
We live in the year 2020.
How dare you make her do that?

595
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,309
Forget it.

596
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,815
No one has sat
in the passenger's seat yet.

597
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,483
Do you want to go for a drive,

598
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,818
since we live in 2020?

599
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,404
I wouldn't sit there
even if you gave me your entire fortune.

600
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,740
I know you fell for my beard.

601
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,201
Goodness!

602
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,994
Why are you here?

603
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,664
Right, how's that kid?

604
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,207
Oh, Mun?

605
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,291
Yes.

606
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,045
-He's coming in right now.
-Whose car is that out there?

607
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,548
Hello.

608
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,217
You must be Mun.

609
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,136
Why?

610
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,929
Does it not seem right for me?

611
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,765
No, what do you mean?
That's an English gentleman's car.

612
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,559
You've all seen the 007 franchise.

613
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,894
The main character gets in that car
in a sharp suit!

614
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,271
-Wow!
-Whoa!

615
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,481
Do you study cars?

616
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,609
I like this kid's personality.

617
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,652
Take a seat.

618
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,862
-Over there.
-Yes, come here.

619
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,407
You've now joined our team.

620
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,909
Take this.

621
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,119
It's a Counter's card.

622
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,246
Counter's card?

623
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,916
Yes, well,
you won't have to use it too often

624
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,793
if you go around with your team.

625
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,421
But you can use it in an emergency.

626
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,715
When a case is closed,
you should always change out

627
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,259
your clothes or anything
that can be used as evidence.

628
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,386
You can also use it for food, housing,
and commuting.

629
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,848
Feel free to use it
as long as you do it as a Counter.

630
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,392
And…

631
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,478
this is

632
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,898
a device that can kill security cameras.

633
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,150
What?

634
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,403
Wait.

635
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,407
Whoa!

636
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,826
But use it only in an emergency.

637
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,079
It disturbs this world's rules.
It's considered cheating.

638
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,748
Oh, I see.

639
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,958
And there's no credit limit on this card.

640
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:38,128
-You can use 10 million won or even 100.
-What?

641
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,548
Mun, have you heard of Jangmul Retail?

642
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,384
Kids don't know anything about business.

643
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,679
A man among the top 50 richest Koreans,
the chairman of Jangmul Retail.

644
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,891
A Counter who's in charge of finances,
our financier.

645
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,227
-Oh, he's…
-Yes.

646
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,772
In a word, I'm the team's sugar daddy.

647
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,940
Okay.

648
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,525
-Are you leaving?
-You're leaving?

649
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,651
You should stay for dinner.

650
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,860
No, I have to go.

651
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,405
And you have to prove your spending
at the end of the year.

652
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,116
I'll cut off your hands

653
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,244
if I catch you stealing my money.

654
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,411
I'll seriously do it.

655
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,746
Yes, sir.

656
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,039
Bye.

657
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,791
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

658
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,209
Goodbye. Your ID.

659
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,044
-What?
-I need it. For a bank account.

660
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,340
Give it to him.
He's making you a bank account.

661
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,092
Oh, okay.

662
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,344
Thank you.

663
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,221
-No training today. Get some rest.
-Yes!

664
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,473
Let's eat, then.

665
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,141
Let me hop in your car.

666
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,103
No way. It'll reek of a guy's smell.

667
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,231
To the Jungjin Police Station, please.

668
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,817
No way. My gosh.

669
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,279
Hey, Ha-na.

670
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,738
Did you watch the news?

671
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,824
The couple from the trail was on the news.

672
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,866
Don't.

673
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,326
Don't ask me to do any favors.

674
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,870
I'm sure their daughter
has heard the news.

675
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,455
-Ms. Chu! Darn it.
-No!

676
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,625
What are you two doing?

677
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,460
To your old workplace? Why?

678
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,838
I thought you cut off your old life.

679
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,506
I thought I cut everything off.

680
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,676
But it might not be the case.

681
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,803
What are you talking about?

682
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,266
Who do you think did that to me
seven years ago?

683
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,185
Who tried to kill this Ga Mo-tak?

684
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,147
Why? What's the reason?

685
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,649
So you can't seem
to bring your memories back?

686
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,235
I'm scared I'll get my memories back.

687
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,403
Why?

688
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,323
I might want revenge.

689
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,914

KIM JEONG-YEONG

THE OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO COMMIT SUICIDE…

698
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,741
Attempted suicide?

699
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,369
Me?

700
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,664
I attempted to commit suicide?

701
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,126

DROVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE

704
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,799
What's this nonsense?

705
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:30,926
KIM JEONG-YEONG

706
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:31,927
Kim Jeong-yeong?

707
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,722
LIEUTENANT KIM JEONG-YEONG

708
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,601
This investigation was
also conducted by Kim Jeong-yeong?

709
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,527
Hello?

710
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,612
Lieutenant Kim, there's a civil petition.

711
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:51,697
A civil petition?

712
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,366
A man wants to have his case explained

713
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,826
by the detective in charge.

714
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,869
What's the case?

715
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,746
-The petitioner is…
-Yes?

716
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:00,872
Mr. Ga Mo-tak.

717
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,750
Mr. Ga Mo-tak?

718
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,919
Yes. It's about a case from 2013.

719
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,091
Did you just say his name is Ga Mo-tak?

720
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,685
WANTED FOR DRUG ABUSE: NOH CHANG-GYU

721
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,441
Man, we had a great lunch
thanks to you, Chang-gyu.

722
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,122
You're not bad with a knife
for an officer.

723
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:57,804
Jeong-yeong?

724
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,806
Where are you going?

725
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,524
Mr. Pyo, we're at the police station.

726
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,151
You can't come in with a wanted--

727
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,235
All right.

728
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,031
Goodness.

729
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,116
WANTED: NOH CHANG-GYU

730
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,454
I'm Noh Chang-gyu, and as of today,
I've been taken off of the wanted list.

731
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,332
Hey, this is a lieutenant.

732
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,083
She's an elite, successful,

733
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,253
and smart officer who'll be promoted
to inspector next year.

734
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,088
Man, I know that already.

735
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,800
The most elite officer, Lieutenant Kim.

736
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,386
We went out for meat to celebrate.

737
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,976
Goodness, Mr. Noh. Congrats.

738
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,395
-Congrats.
-Goodness, Detective Won.

739
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,440
It's nice to see you.

740
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,775
It's nice to see you.

741
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,026
Come on inside.

742
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,528
Why are you so worn out?

743
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,196
I'm doing fine today.

744
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,447
Looks like you need meat.

745
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,199
I always want to eat more meat.

746
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,126
Darn it.

747
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,629
Did you want to see me?

748
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,052
Are you Detective Kim Jeong-yeong?

749
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,888
I thought you'd be a guy.

750
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,643
Anyway,

751
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,145
the guy who just walked in
picking his teeth.

752
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,982
Isn't he this wanted criminal?

753
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,693
Why is a wanted criminal
walking in here with a smile?

754
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,861
Am I seeing things?

755
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,822
You saw that right.

756
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,283
You still have your sharp eyes.

757
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,078
Do you know me?

758
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,042
Let's talk outside.

759
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,670
Let's go out!

760
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,011
By any chance,

761
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:03,889
were we on the same team?

762
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,474
I heard I had worked there,

763
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,144
but I lost all my memories.

764
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,312
I don't remember much.

765
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,148
You seem to know my taste.

766
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,276
You wanted me to explain your case.

767
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,040
INVESTIGATION REPORT

768
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:39,174
INVESTIGATION REPORT

769
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,844
What about these?

770
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,560
Does anyone attempt to kill themselves
this dramatically?

771
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,273
-That's what the situation indicated.
-What was the situation?

772
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,900
Just as the report says.

773
00:53:59,069 --> 00:53:59,986
After seeing this?

774
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,447
I saw that.

775
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,079
-How long have you been doing this?
-If you wish to file an objection,

776
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,081
fill out an application
and make it formal.

777
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,625
If I turn it in, will you reopen the case?

778
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,586
If it has to be reopened,
the higher-ups will say so.

779
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,463
I might end up doing that,

780
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,508
or that detective
who went out with the criminal

781
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,759
might end up doing it.

782
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,469
Isn't it embarrassing?

783
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,723
You conduct a sloppy investigation,
yet you get paid with taxpayers' money.

784
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,186
If you're going to make up the affidavit,
at least make it believable.

785
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,896
A man's life was at stake.

786
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,524
If you can't explain this,
at least make some excuses.

787
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,942
Who told you to cover it up?

788
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,735
Was there a reason?

789
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,116
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

790
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,159
Hey!

791
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,871
How can you call yourself a detective?

792
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,545
Forget about my case.

793
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,629
This one.

794
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,923
So Gwon and Ha Mun-yeong's case.

795
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,011
Was it done properly?
Are you sure it was just a car accident?

796
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,971
Did the perpetrator really kill himself?

797
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,139
Did you go see him?

798
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,558
The driver of the other car
committed suicide.

799
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,226
I went and saw his dead body.

800
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,436
For both of them?

801
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,896
"Both"?

802
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,649
Yes, there were two of them

803
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,110
in that truck.

804
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,990
A kid who was only 11 back then
lost his parents

805
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,617
because of this case you covered up.

806
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,204
Can you really…

807
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,624
take responsibility for this report?

808
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,465
I think this is it.

809
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,259
Yes, this one.

810
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,761
Thanks, Ha-na.

811
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,721
Be quiet. I'm leaving if it's crowded.

812
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,566
We're about to close.

813
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,361
-You can take it to go, though.
-I see.

814
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,031
In that case, two cups of Americano.

815
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:09,741
One second, please.

816
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:25,590
Stop staring at her.

817
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,842
How am I going to do this?

818
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,969
You said I can tell her
without her noticing.

819
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,513
You have to tell me how.

820
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,891
Hold my hand.

821
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,643
What?

822
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,727
Hold my hand. Quickly.

823
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,816
Here's your coffee.

824
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,742
I have to tell my daughter something.

825
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,080
Mom?

826
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,790
Ms. Bae Jeong-suk.

827
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,000
One second.

828
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,879
Things are confusing even for us,

829
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,965
so think about how it'll be
for our daughter.

830
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,466
I want to reassure her.

831
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,802
You said you're a Grim Reaper.

832
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,387
That means you can be in dreams.

833
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,516
I mean, she's shrewd and smart,

834
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,101
so she'll have a great life.

835
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,186
But she tends to keep things in her heart.

836
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,858
Hui-yeong, the recipe to our broth
is behind our family picture.

837
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,317
Dad.

838
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,028
On the day we died,

839
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,865
she got us hiking clothes
to make us go work out,

840
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,033
so I'm sure she's oddly blaming herself.

841
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,829
You have to make sure that she knows

842
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,539
what happened wasn't her fault.

843
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,669
If you don't, she'll be sorry
for a thousand days like a fool.

844
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,799
But I'm not asking you
to take over our rice soup place.

845
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,676
You know that, right?

846
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,052
Do whatever you want to do.

847
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,891
Tell her that we were grateful
to have Hui-yeong as our daughter,

848
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,351
that we love her so much.

849
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,522
Mom and Dad were unbelievably happy.

850
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,485
I hope you'll live as happily as we did.

851
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,654
I love you, Hui-yeong.

852
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,035
Mom.

853
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,871
Dad.

854
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,375
I love you so much too.

855
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,862
BAEKDANG

856
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,991
She came back.

857
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,580
Happy now?

858
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,378
I thought she had to tell her
something much greater.

859
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:12,173
"Be happy. I love you."

860
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,051
That's nothing.

861
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,011
Ha-na.

862
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,890
There's nothing greater than that.

863
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,603
Don't you have such memories?

864
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,189
Mun.

865
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,190
Yes?

866
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,985
Don't get so friendly.

867
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,076
Why do you think

868
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,745
Mun suddenly had an attack?

869
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,914
He was fine for years.

870
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,000
Exactly.

871
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,794
I'm sure there's something going on,

872
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,921
but we can't keep prying.

873
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:55,967
Ju-yeon.

874
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,884
Yes?

875
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,512
-Run to the patrol division back there.
-What?

876
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,849
Stop talking and run with me.

877
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,814
-Ju-yeon!
-Don't say anything.

878
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,943
Hey, punching bag.

879
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,161
Looking good.

880
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,250
A video call?

881
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,501
UNG-MIN

882
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,463
Hey, Ung-min.

883
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,508
Mun…

884
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,594
Ung-min.

885
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,262
Ung-min!

886
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,805
UNG-MIN

887
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,558
Ung-min, what happened to you?

888
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,774
Ju-yeon. Lim Ju-yeon…

889
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,109
Ju-yeon, wake up.

890
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,533
Where are you?

891
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,745
Get here now before I kill them.

892
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,538
Where are you right now?

893
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,126
The derelict factory behind the school.

894
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,012
Man, where's my phone?

895
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,352
"So Gwon"?

896
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,690
Who's So Gwon?

897
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,652
May I borrow your phone?

898
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,416
What is this…

899
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,836
How do I use this thing?

900
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,257
Goodness, I heard you had amnesia.
Don't you know how to call someone?

901
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:00,883
Mr. Ga Mo-tak!

902
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,929
Darn it. Did I become an idiot?

903
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,806
Man.

904
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,851
Could you call this number?

905
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,310
Here.

906
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,063
Goodness. Sure.

907
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,066
SO GWON

908
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,027
So what's your memory like?

909
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,446
You can't remember anything?

910
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:26,451
Goodness, I wonder
if you'll recognize your girlfriend.

911
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:30,037
I have a girlfriend?

912
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,915
My goodness, you poor thing.

913
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,379
You didn't get your life back

914
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,673
for you to get
your personal revenge, Mr. Ga.

915
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,426
This is my business, so shut up!

916
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,474
I wasn't talking to you.

917
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,311
Jeez. Why isn't he picking up?

918
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:15,917
Mister.

919
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:20,171
Goodness! Mister! Oh, no!

920
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,220
If you continue to behave like this,
you will be disqualified as a Counter.

921
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,598
Will you forget your former life

922
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,267
and become a Counter?

923
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:36,896
Or…

924
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,982
will you go back into a coma?

925
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,763
I've never seen
our territory shift like that.

926
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,307
Let's end this.

927
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,519
He lost it and hurt civilians!

928
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,729
Wi-gen almost died because of him.

929
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,398
I'll just get punished for this.

930
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:23,818
Because I don't remember a thing,
I feel like a total idiot.

931
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,695
We were a couple. You and I.

932
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,363
But it's about me and Mun.

933
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,656
Is it really not our job?

934
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,366
It's not catching evil spirits.

935
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,410
These bastards
are worse than evil spirits.

936
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,411
We need our boss.

937
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,829
I will repay you.

938
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,875
