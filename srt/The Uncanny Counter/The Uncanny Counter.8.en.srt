00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,820
Are you guys okay?

6
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm okay too.

7
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,924
What the hell?

8
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,761
Hey! Hurry, quick!

9
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,932
Let's go.

10
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,975
Move it. Quick!

11
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,143
Hurry!

13
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,535
Wi-gen.

14
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,331
What just happened?

15
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,419
-Mom, is everything okay?
-Hey, Su-ho.

16
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,588
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

17
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,798
We must go after an evil spirit now.
Let's talk later.

18
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,259
-You're not hurt?
-Yes, I'm okay!

19
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,890
What?

20
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,185
What's the matter with you, moron?

21
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,777
The noodles are all mushy.
Can you eat that crap?

22
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,240
What the…

23
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,701
Is it broken?

24
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,456
How could I have gotten so strong?

25
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,502
Hang on a second.

26
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,923
-Don't kill me!
-Stay still.

27
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,680
Man, this is interesting.

28
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,849
Shall I try breaking your neck too?

29
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,610
Don't… Please don't kill me. No!

30
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,112
Song Man-ho!

31
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,247
Look who's here. Is that you, Ha-na?

32
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,748
Don't you dare call my name.

33
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,422
You bitch, have you lost your mind?
I'm your uncle.

34
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,429
God damn it!

35
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,364
Who are you people?

36
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,282
You piece of…

37
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,701
Don't touch him. I got this.

38
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,292
Hey, are you doing this
because your family lost everything?

39
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,209
Is that it?

40
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,230
Let's be honest. Did I kill your family?

41
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,608
They took pills and killed themselves.

42
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,402
Why take it out on me?
Seriously, what the hell?

43
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,154
Shut up, you bastard!

44
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,420
Want to get some vessels ruptured?

45
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,759
Damn it.

46
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,813
What do you want?

47
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,272
Apologize to Ha-na.

48
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,573
Ha-na, I'm… I'm sorry.

49
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,325
-For old times' sake--
-Don't…

50
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,121
apologize.

51
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,665
You son of a bitch!

52
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,880
I'll evoke the spirit.

53
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,853
Fine, I'll tie your hair again.

54
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,075
-I'll make him rot in jail
-Hey.

55
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,077
-until the day he dies. Let go!
-Ha-na.

56
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,579
I'll do it.

57
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,841
Where am I?

58
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,593
What is this place?

59
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,914
Where am I?

60
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,792
Am I dreaming?

61
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,213
Did I fall asleep on my way to work?

62
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,839
You're in Yung.

63
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,926
You humans call it

64
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,595
the afterlife.

65
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,223
"The afterlife"?

66
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,727
Am I dead?

67
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,903
I'm only 27.

68
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,740
Mr. Han Seung-woo.

69
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,328
Unfortunately, you died at 17:00
on October 20, 2020

70
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,834
at the age of 26 years, three months,
and 14 days.

71
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,137
I went through a lot to get that job.

72
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,934
I know it's hard for everyone,
but I really went through hoops to get it.

You didn't do anything wrong.

00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,433
I wanted to travel,

95
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,936
get a girlfriend,

Someone's been…

99
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,786
waiting for you.

100
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,308
Grandma?

00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,812
My sweet pumpkin!

102
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,985
Grandma!

103
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,074
Gosh, my dear Seung-woo.

104
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,785
You're all grown up now.

105
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,789
Gosh, my sweet pea.

106

-Grandma.
-Oh, my.

107
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,801
It must've been so hard for you,
my pumpkin.

108
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,974
Let's head in
so you can get some rest, okay?

109
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,267
Come on.

I found Song Man-ho's murder weapon.

112
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,405
Ha-na read his memory,
so she already went to look for it.

113
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,157
He drank with a girl
after killing someone?

114
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:28,617
He's pure evil.

115
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,370
Hi, cuties.

116
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,289
Oh, good to see you.

117
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,585
Look at you. You get my jokes.

118
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,920
What brings you here?

119
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,214
I heard your car got crushed.

120
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,632
Consider me your deliveryman.

121
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,926
-What? A deal?
-He said "delivery."

122
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,011
I can't hear him.

123
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,025
So Mr. Song wasn't lying.

124
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:05,487
You see, I strangled him with this.

125
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
It felt so good.

126
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,659
What the heck are you talking about?

127
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,578
Here, it's a gift.

128
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:16,916
My gosh.

129
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,501
I thought he was joking.

130
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,004
He wasn't, so just hand it over.

131
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,797
I threw it out.

132
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,799
Why would I keep it? It creeps me out.

133
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,017
You told him you had burned it,
but I know you still have it.

134
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,062
You kept it to extort money from him.

Is Mun okay?

141
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,176
When those thugs came by, I had no choice

00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,761
but to tell them everything.

143
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,846
He's fine. What about you?

144
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,599
We went to your place,
but you weren't there.

Where are you staying?

146

We found a new place.
Now, we can live together.

00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,331
I want to be like you when I grow up.

170
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,584
Like me?

171
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:53,674
You're smart, pretty, athletic, and kind.

172
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,510
You have a lot of friends,
and you hang out with me often.

173
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,345
My gosh, I'm not like that.

174
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,185
Ha-yeong,
do you like fried eggs that much?

175
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,520
Yes.

176
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,026
You should have some too.

177
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:14,945
Okay.

178
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,037
Ha-yeong.

179
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,378
I'm sorry I survived alone.

180
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,091
I'm really sorry.

181
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,890
I'm sorry.

182
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,537
Oh, jeez.

183
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,714
What the hell? Why am I here?

184
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,382
What happened?

185
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,677
Gosh! Hey, stop!

186
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,888
Stop! Hey!

187
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,474
Hey, what the hell happened?

188
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,392
Why was I sleeping at the driving range?

189
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,814
You moron! It didn't occur to you
to look for your boss?

190
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,775
You're just sitting in the office?

191
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,236
Meet me here, now!

192
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,322
Jeez.

193
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,407
What happened?

194
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,285
I don't remember anything from yesterday.

195
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,162
Damn it.

196
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,340
Song Man-ho, you're under arrest
for the murder of Han Seung-woo.

197
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,384
What the hell?
I told you I didn't kill him!

198
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,010
Get lost! Got any evidence?

199
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,970
Hey.

200
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:04,888
Bring a warrant.

201
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,645
You have the right to remain silent

202
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,647
and can get an attorney. Anything you say

203
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,316
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

204
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,443
Okay, fine. Hold on!

205
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,528
Let me call my lawyer.

206
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,696
-Come on.
-One second.

207
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,613
Hey, hold on.

208
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,031
Let me make a quick call.

209
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,949
-Jeez!
-Come on!

210
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,784
-Don't lose your grip.
-Let go!

211
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,995
Do you know who Mr. Noh is?

212
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,579
-You bastards.
-Calm down.

213
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,081
Let go, you assholes!

214
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,708
There he is. He's here!

215
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,461
Song Man-ho, who was released
on the 20th due to lack of evidence,

216
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,424
has once again been arrested
for the murder of Han Seung-woo.

217
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,429
Since I'm in such a good mood today,
this is on the house.

218
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,264
-Seriously?
-My gosh!

219
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,474
-Is it your birthday today?
-Gosh, no.

220
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,146
Song abused his employees often,
verbally and physically.

221
00:21:54,229 --> 00:22:00,152
He beat Han to death
for his "defiant attitude."

222
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,529
Did you really hack and tap
your employees' phones?

223
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,613
Do you admit it?

224
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,906
-Any comments?
-Look here!

225
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,033
Any comments?

226
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,076
The murder weapon

227
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,996
was Han's lanyard,
like the one I'm wearing now.

228
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,583
Han finally managed to land a job
after 25 job interviews,

229
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,419
but the lanyard for his own employee card
ended up being

230
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,254
a weapon that strangled him to death.

231
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,925
A young man has created a website
to mourn Han's death,

232
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,262
and there are already thousands of posts
expressing condolences.

233
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,348
E-FUNERAL SITE FLOODED WITH COMMENTS

234
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,516
EONNI'S NOODLES

235
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,898
EONNI'S NOODLES

236
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,233
EONNI'S NOODLES

237
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,487
Here, look.

238
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,785
It's not Baekwon Reservoir.

239
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,995
As you can see,
it's surrounded by reed fields.

240
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:53,997
What about it?

241
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,415
Around the reservoir…

242
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,503
there isn't a single paved road.

243
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,670
Get it now?

244
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,928
So it's a different reservoir?

245
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,515
This is what we'll do.

246
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:16,394
This contains Song Man-ho's ledger
for Taesin Group's slush funds.

247
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:20,065
We can use this to take down
Cho Tae-sin and those bastards.

248
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,441
Let's wrap it up like that.

249
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,819
Illegally obtained evidence
isn't admissible.

250
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,612
Forget the police and prosecutors.

251
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,447
We'll report him to the tax office.

252
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,740
Then he can't fight back.

253
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,701
Sure, we can report him
for embezzlement and bribery.

254
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,038
But that won't punish him
for killing Mun's parents.

255
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,541
Got any evidence?

256
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:43,046
Can you prove that they hired hit men
to kill Mun's parents?

257
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,131
How will you prove it?

258
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,050
We will find evidence.

259
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,594
We can do it.

260
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,431
There it is.

261
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,891
The new one.

262
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,480
My goodness.

263
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,940
EONNI'S NOODLES

264
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,240
Well, this is nothing.

265
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,577
It's not bulletproof though.

266
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,916
Gosh, we only had the other car
for three years. What a waste.

267
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,169
I wish it could be salvaged. Too bad.

268
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,214
Those pricks had a tracker on your car.

269
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,800
-What?
-Those bastards…

270
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,636
I bet they were planning
to kill all of you at once.

271
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,138
Unbelievable.

272
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,933
-Mo-tak.
-Hey, where are you going?

273
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:37,934
Mo-tak!

274
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,311
-Jeez.
-Hey, Mo-tak!

275
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,021
-My gosh.
-Where are you going?

276
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,314
-Where are you going?
-Hey!

277
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,649
-Come back!
-Mo-tak!

278
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,360
That punk.

279
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,873
TAESIN GROUP

280
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,991
Hello, can I help you?

281
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,911
Oh, well…

282
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:42,874
I'm here to see Mr. Noh Hang-gyu.
Do you know…

283
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,335
which floor is his office?

284
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,545
Why do you need to see him?

285
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,800
-You know, you can't just walk in here.
-I see.

286
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,057
Let me borrow this, okay?

287
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,144
Ga Mo-tak!

288
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,521
What are you thinking?

289
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,065
Ga Mo-tak!

290
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,069
How does this work?

291
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:14,739
TAESIN

292
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,077
There we go. That worked.

293
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,704
I got it working.

294
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,289
Why are you here?

295
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,625
Oh, to see Noh Hang-gyu. I mean…

296
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,169
I'm here to see Mr. Noh Hang-gyu.

297
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,587
Executive Director Noh?

298
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,215
Why do you keep meddling in human affairs?

299
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,051
At this rate, you'll be stripped
of your rights as a Counter.

300
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,262
And so will I.

301
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,932
Gi-ran, this elevator is very fast.

302
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,600
Please don't cause trouble!

303
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,686
You'll relapse into a coma.

304
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,814
Why would I cause trouble?
I'm a rational person.

305
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,026
Send a few to the elevator on level 12.

306
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,695
Do you have an appointment?

307
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,197
Well, the thing is…

308
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,907
I have a bit of a situation.

309
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,576
You see…

310
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:09,878
Who are you?

311
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,380
Your buddy here fell asleep.

312
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,320
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

313
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,237
NOH HANG-GYU

314
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,074
-Mr. Noh?
-Yes.

315
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,700
The order and guest list are here.

316
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,535
CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE PLANS

317
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,166
The leader of the Reformers' Party
can give a congratulatory speech.

318
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,630
-Hey!
-Get lost!

319
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,978
Mo-tak!

320
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,779
What do we do?

321
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,116
Even Ha-na keeps breaking the rules.

322
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,411
She's been using her powers
on regular people.

323
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,254
I can't stand the two of you.

324
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,674
I guess I'm the only bad guy here.

325
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,345
I want to be reincarnated.

326
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,267
I can't let them bog me down.

327
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,608
They need a serious warning, Wi-gen.

328
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,071
Don't treat me like a kid.

329
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,999
Who… Who are you?

330
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,793
Security!

331
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,430
Jeez, what the…

332
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,515
What happened here?

333
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:38,818
Wow, nice office.

334
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,365
You don't need to glare at me like that.

335
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,579
I'm just impressed that a thug
has managed to become such a hotshot.

336
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,747
It's a compliment.

337
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,791
You may leave.

338
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,501
Yes, sir.

339
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,921
Stay so I can tell you all about
his drug-dealing days.

340
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,005
Why leave?

341
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,259
Cut the crap.
Just get straight to the point.

342
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,929
Give me a cup of coffee.

343
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,223
Unbelievable.

344
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:14,103
Who should really be saying that now?

345
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,980
You or me?

346
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,234
Or is it the fact that someone
who treats others' lives like dirt

347
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,862
is sitting in an office like this
that is utterly unbelievable?

348
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,574
I never treated others' lives like dirt.

349
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,701
You've come to the wrong place.

350
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:34,290
Killing and burying people.

351
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,336
It's all so easy for you guys, isn't it?

352
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,423
It may have been easy so far,

353
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,886
but that will no longer be the case.
Remember that.

354
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,853
Cut the bullshit. Bring evidence.

355
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,608
I know Kim Yeong-nim's body
is in the reservoir.

356
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,700
I'll find it even if I have to drain
all the water out of the reservoir.

357
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,165
Back off, you little shit!

358
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,001
Just let him go.

359
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,211
He seems pretty angry.

360
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,422
Don't get on his nerves.

361
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,343
Don't send these cockroaches
to the restaurant.

362
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,179
Next time, I won't let you
walk away unscathed.

363
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,271
-Go check.
-Yes, sir!

364
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,987
Hey, are you okay?

365
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,780
Did he hurt you?

366
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:52,869
Jae-cheol said that prick didn't seem
to remember anything, right?

367
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:53,786
Why do you ask?

368
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,039
That moron thinks that the reservoir

369
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,541
is an actual reservoir.

370
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,752
Really?

371
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,796
Leave them be until the event is over.

372
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,673
Just keep an eye on them.

373
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,425
Don't do anything.

374
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,218
Hang-gyu.

375
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,929
I told you.

376
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,473
The truth is, we can't do anything.

377
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,018
That freak won't die,

378
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,895
even if he falls from the roof

379
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,147
or gets crushed by a truck.

380
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,316
Those freaks aren't human.

381
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,110
For real.

382
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,195
EONNI'S NOODLES

383
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,621
-What are you up to?
-Hey, Mo-tak.

384
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,498
Mo-tak.

385
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,084
What do you think this truck was doing?

386
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,461
It's not in the video that he sent you.

387
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,215
My dad must've only sent you the part
with the black car.

388
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,844
Your dad was on a stakeout.

389
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,055
Stakeout?

390
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,686
He parked his car
and kept filming that spot.

391
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,066
You're right.

392
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
What do you think

393
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,906
he was waiting for?
The black car or this truck?

394
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,494
Don't!

395
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,162
There's no way he was on a stakeout

396
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,789
waiting for them to toss the body.

397
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:24,669
-Bingo.
-Oh, the truck.

398
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,381
He must've spotted the black car
while waiting for the truck.

399
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,592
I was working on the Kim Yeong-nim case,
so he shared it with me,

400
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,012
and we started working together.

401
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,974
And it became a joint investigation.

402
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,517
Then this truck…

403
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,645
What was it carrying to the reservoir?

404
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,736
What was my dad waiting for?

405
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,614
BAM!

406
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,782
A reservoir?

407
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,953
Yes, I saw my dad's notebook.

408
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,289
He had jotted down "reservoir"
and some numbers.

409
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,458
I see. What about it?

410
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:09,505
Was he investigating a case
related to some kind of reservoir?

411
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,883
That's my guess.

412
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,469
Then let's find out.

413
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,595
-What?
-Move over.

414
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,180
-What? Okay.
-Move.

415
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,807
A reservoir…

416
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,229
Let's see. A reservoir.

417
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,482
JUNGJIN

418
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,566
SEARCH

419
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,791
Nothing, right?

420
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,501
Wrong.

421
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,254
You saw it in your dad's notebook,
so it must exist.

422
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,839
Can I see it again?

423
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,095
-Hold on.
-Jeez.

424
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,181
What if this reservoir existed
seven years ago

425
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,682
but is gone now?

426
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,600
How?

427
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,812
Reservoirs can dry up
during intense droughts and can also

428
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,063
be reclaimed.

429
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,649
-Let's check seven years ago.
-Smarty-pants.

430
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,780
Oh, wait. Let me see.

431
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,615
I can't see from here.

432
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,997
This spot looks sandy brown
in the satellite image from this year.

433
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,876
But in the image from seven years ago…

434
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,258
It's green.

435
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,849
Why is it like this?

436
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,562
Gosh, stop it!

437
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,479
Hold on.

438
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:49,856
Ouch.

439
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:54,235
-Gosh, I don't like this. Stop!
-Hold on. Just a second.

440
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,320
Can you please stay still?

441
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,781
The memorial ceremony is coming up.

442
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,702
Mun-yeong will visit us. Goodness.

443
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,497
-Mun-yeong?
-Yes, come on.

444
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,587
Let's make sure you look
all clean and pretty when she comes.

445
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:18,259
She'll think,
"My parents seem to be doing great."

446
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,596
-She'll be relieved, right?
-The police have stated

447
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:26,100
that the suspect in the three murders
which recently took place in Jungjin

448
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,353
is the same person,
and this news is causing quite a stir.

449
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,063
The police have put out an APB

450
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,858
-for Ji Cheong-sin, the suspect.
-My gosh.

451
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,151
That evil bastard.

452
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:39,238
It seems like the world is becoming
a worse place to live.

453
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,241
He's 180 cm tall and is on the slim side.

454
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,826
-They've put out an APB.
-He has

455
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,829
sharp eyes and a scar near the temple
on the right side.

456
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,416
We have to track him down
before the police do.

457
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,044
We can't find him now.

458
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,962
He must've totally gone into hiding.

459
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,841
Will we not find him

460
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,968
until he kills someone?

461
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,891
72D6542, 92R7089,

462
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:11,270
86S6260.
If you see these license plate numbers,

463
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,357
please call 911 or contact
the Jungjin Police Station directly.

464
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,193
While the public is extremely terrified
and anxious

465
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,446
due to the heinous, cruel way
he murdered his victims,

466
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,824
Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi addressed
the people of Jungjin earlier today.

467
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:29,163
Today, the City of Jungjin
declares war against violent crimes.

468
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,667
All police officers will be fully armed
to effectively tackle crimes

469
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,127
and any act of violence.

470
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,756
We will not let this murderer
threaten the peace

471
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,549
and security of our city, Jungjin.

472
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,263
The City of Jungjin will utilize
its top investigative professionals

473
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,976
and all of its authority and resources
and be placed on high alert.

474
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:55,856
The City will remain on high alert until
there is no reason for us to be worried.

475
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,609

00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,513
I saw "reservoir" in my dad's notebook.

481
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,308
Right here. "Reservoir" and some numbers.

482
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,402
Three, seven, nine, five,

483
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,696
D, one, two, three, six, one…

MO-TAK

486
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,546
Mo-tak, I think I've figured out
where the reservoir is. Yes.

Every second matters.

491
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,057
We've already set up
a special task force, sir.

492
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,600
We'll catch him.

493
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,477
Good.

494
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,020
Do your very best.

495
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,831
MO-TAK

496
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,836
I have a utility pole number.
Can you find out where it is?

497
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,338
A utility pole?

498
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,173
Hold on.

499
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,844
Three, seven, nine, five,
uppercase D, one, two, three.

500
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,682
Six, one, uppercase R, three, three.
Uppercase L and one.

501
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,393
ISEON-DONG, DONG-GU, JUNGJIN

502
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,978
Iseon-dong, Dong-gu, Jungjin
in Gyeonggi Province.

503
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,063
EONNI'S NOODLES

504
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,874
Brief us on the case.

505
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,459
Pardon?

506
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,377
SPECIAL TASK FORCE

507
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,422
From now on,
all meetings will be kept confidential.

508
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,466
Jeong-yeong, you may begin.

509
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,556
WANTED
SUSPECT IN JUNGJIN SERIAL MURDER

510
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,727
I'll begin the briefing on Ji Cheong-sin,
the suspect

511
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,396
in the Jungjin serial murder.

512
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,022
Where did you see him?

513
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,482
-Right.
-Where?

514
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,651
Please call us if you find out more.

515
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,903
-Where did you see the car?
-Right.

516
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,530
-You saw the plate?
-Which one?

517
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,240
-What was he wearing?
-I see.

518
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,452
Detective Lee, you should focus
on this area.

519
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,246
Detective Kim,
you take this area over here.

520
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,834
Han-ul, we got a call around 12:36 p.m.
from the industrial complex.

521
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,794
On the map, it's here.

522
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,421
So around here?

523
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:20,186
Why did you withdraw all the money
from Ji Hyeong-u's foreign account?

524
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:23,022
Do you know how much money

525
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,733
a woman needs when she lives alone?

526
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:28,944
Wait, my nose.

527
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,822
Have you sued that asshole yet?

528
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,449
"Asshole"?

529
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,701
That asshole at the department store!

530
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,917
Hey!

531
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,712
My ex-husband died
because he yelled at me like that.

532
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,671
What?

533
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,674
Anyway, file a claim against him soon.

534
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,134
I want compensation.

535
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,220
I've spent a fortune on this nose.

536
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,721
Baek Hyang-hui.

537
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,057
You're here as a suspect in a murder case.

538
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,767
-If you keep spewing--
-Hey.

539
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,064
Do you really want to die?

540
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,946
I request that my client
receive a psychiatric assessment.

541
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,489
What?

542
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,407
Are you saying I'm crazy?

543
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,454
Oh, right!

544
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:23,958
Someone…

545
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,794
Someone told me to kill him.

546
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:29,630
Please believe me.

547
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,062
Right? We did it together.

548
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,360
Stop putting on an act.

549
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,405
I'm sure you knew
about his peanut allergy.

550
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,948
How shall I kill next time?

551
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,909
Stab the person?

552
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,746
-Split the person in half with an ax?
-Baek Hyang-hui.

553
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,749
-Stop joking around.
-Poisoning is the most hassle-free way.

554
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,918
No one can find out.

555
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,971
He's all scared! What an idiot.

556
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,765
You're crazy. You're really insane.

557
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,908
I bet you can track down the asshole
who did this to my nose.

558
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,160
You can, right?

559
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,578
Baek Hyang-hui, calm down!

560
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,707
Why should I?

561
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,002
The next one.

562
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,802
It's here.

563
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,185
RESERVOIR
3795D123, 61R33L1

564
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,146
3795D123
61R33L1

565
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,483
This is it.

566
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,292
My dad was here.

567
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,380
The "reservoir"
wasn't an actual reservoir.

568
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,300
Let's go.

569
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,681
PRIVATE PROPERTY
KEEP OUT

570
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,103
What is that?

571
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,857
A surveillance drone.

572
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,666
Just like seven years ago,

573
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,502
trucks are still going in and out
of this place.

574
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,213
Let's go.

575
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,800
Wait, when did she…

576
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,747
Shit.

577
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,628
Gosh, these bastards.
They've been dumping garbage here.

578
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,673
So Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
must be buried somewhere here.

579
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,352
This place is huge.
How are we going to find her?

580
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,395
They buried her seven years ago.

581
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,444
Guys, don't you smell this funky odor?

582
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,531
Yes, I've been thinking
something smells funky.

583
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,452
I'm not sure. I have chronic sinusitis.

584
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,919
Gosh, it stinks.

585
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:19,920
What's this?

586
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:23,840
They should've dumped garbage
on top of a waterproof ground layer

587
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,133
but didn't bother with it.

588
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,469
The groundwater is contaminated.

589
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,809
They must be draining this water somehow.

590
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,663
My goodness.

591
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,707
Those assholes.

592
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,089
I think Jungjin Dam is over there.

593
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,134
Jungjin Dam? That means
this garbage water is flowing

594
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,720
into the city's water supply.

595
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,805
Shit.

596
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,185
I've been making noodles with this water?

597
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,482
These bastards…

598
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,159
Looks good, right?

599
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,661
Shouldn't we lower it a little?

600
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,625
If we report them for illegal dumping,

601
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,335
will they go to jail?

602
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,795
If the police can't do that for us,

603
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,715
we'll at least make
the Ministry of Environment issues a fine.

604
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,008
That's not enough.

605
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,012
That water must be wreaking havoc
on people's health.

606
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,823
Mun, you should get some sleep too.

607
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:14,826
I can't.

608
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,414
You think too much, kiddo.

609
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,229
I'm off.

610
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,232
Mun, here. Take this.

611
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,484
What is this?

612
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:48,902
Just some meat.

613
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,363
Tomorrow is your parents'
memorial ceremony.

614
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,572
Make some soup for them.

615
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,243
I wanted to do it myself, but it's late.

616
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,911
Do you know how to do it?

617
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,914
Yes, I can cook those dishes
better than my grandpa can.

618
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:03,041
-Good.
-Thank you.

619
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,293
Then give me 500 won.

620
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,798
Get home safely.

621
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,726
When did you make the soup?

622
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,561
Oh, I got up very early and made it.

623
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,020
My gosh.

624
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,107
Look at me! How do I look?

625
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,900
You look pretty. Very pretty.

626
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,363
Excuse me. Can I have some?

627
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,324
Sure.

628
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,747
All right. Here, sweetie.

629
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,627
Tell your parents that we are
so grateful for all the food they sent.

630
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,713
-Will do.
-Great.

631
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,132
-Here, you too.
-Thank you.

632
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,175
Cutie-pie.

633
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,679
Even if Mun ends up getting a girlfriend,

634
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,890
you must stay his bestie forever.

635
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,892
-Okay, I will.
-Good.

636
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,189
Grandma, try it with some meat.

637
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,900
It's hot, okay? Be careful.

638
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,239
Gosh, it's hot.

639
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,408
Oh, it's good.

640
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,952
Is today New Year's Day?

641
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,914
No, the memorial ceremony.

642
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,957
Who died?

643
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,668
Your daughter.

644
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,588
My daughter? You mean, your mom?

645
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,259
The years she lived as your daughter

646
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,471
outnumber the years she lived as my mom.

647
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:43,058
So today, we'll call her your daughter.
I'll let you do that.

648
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:44,935
Want some?

649
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,898
-No?
-You have it.

650
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,567
No, no. Here!

651
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,490
HA MUN-YEONG
SO GWON

652
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,349
Two deep bows.

653
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,451
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

654
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,082
SUSPECT IN JUNGJIN SERIAL MURDER

655
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,607
Suspect spotted in Cheonmyeong 1-dong.

656
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,066
Suspect spotted in Wolhwa 3-dong.

657
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,485
Car Four, headed to Cheonmyeong 1-dong.

658
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,362
Can Ji Cheong-sin teleport or what?

659
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,324
How can he simultaneously appear
in two different neighborhoods?

660
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,035
People are worried and anxious,

661
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,370
so they call when they spot
someone similar.

662
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,875
We got a call from someone who spotted Ji

663
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,044
at 9 Jinseon-ro,
over by Sangjin Electronics.

664
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,755
Car Three, headed to 9 Jinseon-ro.

665
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,428
Hey, wait.

666
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,889
Your grandma hates it
when you pick the flowers.

667
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,057
Lower your voice.

668
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,725
It's for my mom and dad.

669
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,684
Oh, I see.

670
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,394
-What about this one?
-Nice.

671
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,522
Let's go…

672
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,735
Grandpa, where are you going?

673
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,905
Oh, your grandma is craving bungeoppang.

674
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,490
I see. Wait, Grandpa.

675
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,742
I'll go pick some up.

676
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,410
-Go back inside. It's cold.
-Yes.

677
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,204
Would you?

678
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,373
All right, then. Be safe.

679
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,415
-Bye.
-Take care.

680
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,333
Bye, guys.

681
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,634
Hey, don't pick too many.

682
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,885
She'll be able to tell.

683
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,892
9 JINSEON-RO

684
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,836
Let's come here every year.

685
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,006
-Okay.
-Until we turn 20.

686
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,298
No, until we turn 30.

687
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,843
Okay.

688
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,889
Your mom and dad must've seen
that your legs are fine now.

689
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,810
I'm sure it made them happy. Very happy.

690
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,692
Thanks, guys. Let's go.

691
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,609
All right.

692
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,445
See you in school.

693
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,113
Bye!

694
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,906
Hey, Mun!

695
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,075
The web comic contest is coming up.

696
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,411
I'll finish it by tomorrow.

697
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,328
You can do it!

698
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,606
Mom.

699
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,317
Dad.

700
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,321
Wait just a bit longer.

701
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,865
I'll catch that bastard

702
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,619
and hold a better ceremony for you
next year.

703
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,414
I miss you.

704
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:00,852
Found you.

705
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,763
-You can't do it alone, Mun.
-Looking for me?

706
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:37,764
So this is it.

707
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,058
It's what makes you suddenly strong.

708
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,809
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

709
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,686
-Mun!
-Mun.

710
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,606
I have to kill more people. More people…

711
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,982
Ji Cheong-sin…

712
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:50,568
is not someone the police can catch.

713
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,238
-An officer is dead.
-What?

714
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:56,366
You're declaring your candidacy
on the day of the groundbreaking ceremony?

715
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,576
People don't know that things like this

716
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,994
are happening in Jungjin.

717
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,204
Let's tell them.

718
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,705
Let's cause an uproar.

719
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,167
