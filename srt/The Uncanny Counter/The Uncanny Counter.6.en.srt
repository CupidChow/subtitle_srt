00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,019
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,896
OCCUPATIONS IN THIS DRAMA
ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,897
I…

4
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,358
clearly remember seeing you dead.

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,237
You already died, you asshole.

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,199
Was it you?

7
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,328
Did you stab me?

8
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,645
Who's this guy?

9
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,524
Chang-gyu!

10
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,528
Come on, you idiot. Move it!

11
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,780
That's Ga Mo-tak.

12
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,448
He's alive.

13
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,619
Hey, hurry up! That's Ga Mo-tak!

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,505
Don't worry too much.

15
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,757
Wait inside with your sister.

16
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,477
He's so drugged up
that his memories are all mixed up.

17
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,937
It's hard to read them.

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,148
However,

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,526
I'm sure he's the one who stabbed you.

20
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,946
Damn it. Why though?

21
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,699
Why did he try to kill Mo-tak? Just why?

22
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,117
What else

23
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,660
did you see?

24
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,621
A woman. A 22-year-old female.

25
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,832
Didn't he kill her?

26
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,292
Kim Yeong-nim?

27
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,047
That I didn't see.

28
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,927
Anything else?

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,888
Did you see him meeting her

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,933
or talking about her with someone,
perhaps?

31
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,145
I can't really see much.

32
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,188
I'm not sure.

33
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,567
Who is Kim Yeong-nim?

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,782
You said he's the bastard that stabbed me.

35
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,870
-You're sure, right?
-That I'm sure.

36
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,429
What should we do with him?

37
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,015
Hand him over to the police.
We have all the evidence.

38
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,558
What evidence?

39
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,019
Mo-tak is living proof of what happened.

40
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,104
And the memories you read
are also evidence.

41
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,690
The police must've been in on this.

42
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,610
He walks in and out of the police station
as if he owns it

43
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,403
despite the wanted poster for him.

44
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,739
Gosh, how could the police
do such a thing?

45
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,907
That makes no sense.

46
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,618
It does make sense,
at least here in Jungjin.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,122
Let's erase his memory and let him go.

48
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,166
We must catch the one above him.

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,044
Them knowing you're alive
won't do us any good.

50
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,337
The one above him?

51
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,633
He's just a henchman.
Someone else gives orders.

52
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,468
Whack a detective?

53
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,345
Bro, are you crazy? Kill him, for real?

54
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,721
"Bro"?

55
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,598
It sounded like he was talking

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,725
to his real brother.

57
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,733
119 EMERGENCY RESPONSE

58
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,702
MO-TAK

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,954
Hi, Mo-tak.

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,164
Noh Chang-gyu?

61
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,917
I need information on his family.
Any siblings?

62
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,421
He has an elder brother.
His name is Noh Hang-gyu.

63
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,924
-He's an executive at Taesin Construction.
-An executive at Taesin?

64
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,343
Why do you ask?

65
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:05,930
Hello?

66
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:06,931
Mo-tak.

67
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,645
Apparently, this prick's brother
is an executive at Taesin Construction.

68
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,022
What does that mean?

69
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,107
A corporate executive got his thug brother

70
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,985
to commit murder.
If what I saw is true, that is.

71
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,448
Let's throw him as bait.

72
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,409
And we'll see who makes a move and how.

73
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,496
EPISODE 6

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,053
Is this the control room?

75
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,144
Mo-tak, let's go. Quick!

76
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,815
ATTENTION: NOH HANG-GYU

77
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,778
The security monitors are…

78
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,614
Oh, they're okay now. Yes, thank you.

79
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,621
What is that?

80
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,637
ATTENTION: NOH HANG-GYU

81
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,181
I'll check, sir.

82
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,563
ATTENTION: NOH HANG-GYU

83
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,917
It makes sense that Taesin is involved.

84
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,588
The case was buried
even though detectives were killed.

85
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,924
It's not something thugs can pull off.

86
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,259
"Detectives"?

87
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,262
There's someone else who died?

88
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,765
Yes, a former colleague of mine.

89
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,059
A colleague? Did this detective die

90
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,353
while working on the Kim Yeong-nim case
with you?

91
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,106
-Make a left here?
-No, at the next light.

92
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,023
Oh, okay.

93
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,819
Gosh, these people are so evil.

94
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,197
Thank goodness you survived.

95
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,160
Gosh.

96
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,144
We can't keep it from him forever.
We should tell him.

97
00:07:59,103 --> 00:07:59,979
No, not yet.

98
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,773
You know he blames himself
for the accident.

99
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,693
He can't handle the fact
that they were murdered.

100
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,779
He'll have a mental breakdown.
It'll be hell for him.

101
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,448
But…

102
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,283
His family was murdered,

103
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,786
but he doesn't know who did it.
Do you know how crazy it can drive you?

104
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,416
I hate hiding stuff from him,
whatever it is.

105
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,586
Says the person
who doesn't tell us anything.

106
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,215
That's what wounds are like.

107
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,552
No one should bring it up
without much thought or take it lightly.

108
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,433
EONNI'S NOODLES

109
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,569
Did you hear about that incident?

110
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,612
What incident?

111
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,740
Some crazy woman showed up
at the department store.

112
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,034
You know those people
who talk to themselves

113
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,578
and laugh hysterically
while picking fights.

114
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,248
-Right, those people.
-Anyway, I heard that woman

115
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,584
scratched a sales clerk's neck
with her nails like this

116
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,045
-and snatched her necklace.
-I see.

117
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,214
The sales clerk fainted
with blood gushing out.

118
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,173
That's nuts.

119
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
But right at that moment, some passersby

120
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,097
took down that crazy woman.
But the thing is,

121
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,808
I heard one of them

122
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,852
had curly hair.

123
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,314
Mun, was it you?

124
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,776
That's what I'm suspecting.

125
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,446
Well, don't suspect anything.

126
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,990
Got anything to tell us?

127
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,201
I don't think so.

128
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,082
-Was it really you?
-No, I told you it wasn't me.

129
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,210
Hey, come on! What happened? Tell us.

130
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,671
-What? Tell you what?
-You're acting suspicious.

131
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,882
I'm going to wipe out all your memories!

132
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,843
-Wipe them out?
-Wipe them out?

133
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,428
Who can do that?

134
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,805
-You little…
-Anyway, that wasn't me.

135
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,640
-Bye, guys!
-No, I don't believe you.

136
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,226
-I think it was you.
-Is he a secret agent?

137
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,396
-Wait up.
-Hey, hurry.

138
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,273
Hey!

139
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,370
SEGWANG INTERSECTION

140
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,255
Hey, wait.

141
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,883
SEGWANG INTERSECTION

142
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,683
Hey, Mun. Are you all right?

143
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,227
Yes.

144
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,063
Want to go there?

145
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,483
No, not yet.

146
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,110
I don't think I'm ready to see it.

147
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,988
I totally get it.

148
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,659
Every time I walk by
those bullies' secret hangout,

149
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,494
my heart still races.

150
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,624
If you want to go there, tell us.
We'll go with you.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,085
Okay.

152
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,337
Let's go.

153
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,709
How are you feeling?

154
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,169
I'm in pain, obviously.

155
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,337
What happened?

156
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,716
I don't remember anything.

157
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,009
I'm dumbfounded.

158
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,636
Damn it.

159
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,431
Who the heck did this?

160
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,188
Did you do drugs?

161
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,231
No, I didn't.

162
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,160
Hello, Boss.

163
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,287
How did you get all beaten up?

164
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,872
On the job yesterday…

165
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,249
Oh, right. Ga Mo-tak showed up.

166
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,333
Who?

167
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,085
He keeps spewing baloney.

168
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,962
I'm dead serious! Jeez!

169
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,924
Hey. Remember that detective?

170
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,301
I saw his look-alike.

171
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,054
You also said you had seen his look-alike.

172
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,517
Oh, that.
Just someone that looked like him.

173
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,312
How could he show up?
He died seven years ago.

174
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,189
I'm telling you. I really saw him.

175
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,775
He looked a little older,
but I'm sure it was Ga Mo-tak.

176
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,323
You guys told me that you checked
to make sure he was dead.

177
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,954
He must be dead, right?

178
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,832
That bastard.

179
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,001
Of course, he wouldn't die quietly.

180
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,712
We sure did.

181
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,257
You said you made sure
he wasn't breathing.

182
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,842
-Yes, we did.
-Yes, we did.

183
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,012
Then what happened?

184
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,181
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

185
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,682
This idiot is mistaken!

186
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,144
Oh, there was something odd.
Maybe he lost his memory or something.

187
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,270
He didn't recognize me.

188
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,064
That's because he's not Ga Mo-tak.

189
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,524
Idiot, cut down on drinking!

190
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,442
Gosh…

191
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,819
Was I really mistaken?

192
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,865
You crazy shitheads.

193
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,325
Are you kidding me?

194
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,284
Boss.

195
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,411
Go find out.

196
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,997
If it's indeed Ga Mo-tak, bring him to me.

197
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,961
Even if it's not him,
you'll have to bring him to me.

198
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,003
Yes, Boss.

199
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,552
How come I can't find
a single interview or article

200
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,470
about this Taesin executive?

201
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,931
-Are you talking about Noh Hang-gyu?
-Mun.

202
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,184
Oh, I'm working on my web comic.

203
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,523
You guys just never listen to me.

204
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,943
I clearly told you
not to meddle in human affairs.

205
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,363
Even though we're in between
the two realms, we're also human.

206
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,199
-Why must we draw the line?
-We have to.

207
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,952
We can tell who's possessed
by an evil spirit.

208
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,829
You even talked Ha-na into it.

209
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,789
This girl may be rude at times,

210
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,375
but she always drew a clear line.
What's with her now?

211
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,627
And you.

212
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,379
When that crazy woman scratched you,

213
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,883
I wanted to treat your wound,
but you pushed me away.

214
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,801
What's wrong with you guys?

215
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,344
What's the problem?

216
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,638
-I'm sorry.
-Too late!

217
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,684
If this is how it's going to be,
I'll quit being your leader.

218
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,853
So good luck without me.

219
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,314
Maybe relapsing into a coma
will teach you a lesson.

220
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,776
Only Ha-na can read all the memories,
so we had no choice.

221
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,364
Yesterday, we caught the man
who had stabbed Mo-tak.

222
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,869
You caught him?

223
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,247
And what happened?
Did you hand him over to the police?

224
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,583
-No.
-Why not?

225
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,543
The instigator is someone else.

226
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,463
-And there's no evidence.
-What are you talking about?

227
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,590
Just break a few joints,

228
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,508
and he'll tell us everything.

229
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,011
Just record that and hand him over
to the police.

230
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,472
Don't we need to use our powers
to break his joints?

231
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,766
Right.

232
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,019
-You're right. Jeez!
-It's a catch-22.

233
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,313
Why did you even tell me?

234
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,232
I don't care whether
you catch that punk or not.

235
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,109
Don't tell me about human affairs!

236
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,487
-Leave me out.
-All right.

237
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,033
Who is this scumbag?

238
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,576
What does he look like?

239
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,994
Who is this bastard?

240
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,331
Will you make up your mind?

241
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,209
Don't tell me anything. Leave me out!

242
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm the only one who's lonely.
No one else!

243
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,928
Who's lonely?

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,846
It breaks my heart.

245
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,186
Are you a ghost or what?

246
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,814
What is that? Instant noodles?

247
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,107
Oh, dear.

248
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,360
How about some pasta?

249
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,861
Jjajangmyeon.

250
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,405
Let's have that.

251
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,198
Jjajangmyeon, it is.

252
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,243
-See you in a bit.
-See you.

253
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,203
-Let's go.
-Darn you.

254
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,999
See you.

255
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,631
SMART CAMERA SEARCH RESULTS

256
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,757
What?

257
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,676
WANTED FOR SPECIAL ASSAULT
NOH HANG-GYU

258
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,512
Mo-tak, I found him.

259
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,682
But not as a Taesin executive.

260
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,475
Noh Hang-gyu. He's a wanted criminal.

261
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,811
NAME: NOH HANG-GYU
MALE, AGE 30

262
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,022
What? So this bastard is a thug too?

263
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,443
Taesin Construction's executive director
committed special assault?

264
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,778
Who are these pricks?

265
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,280
NOH HANG-GYU

266
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,622
Jae-cheol, why on earth
did you spew such baloney?

267
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,083
It was Ga Mo-tak. I'm sure of it.

268
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,169
We should've made sure he was dead.

269
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,379
We didn't need to.

270
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,339
I stabbed him multiple times.

271
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,092
And how could he survive a fall
from the 10th floor?

272
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,344
-That's true.
-What are you doing?

273
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,098
Chang-gyu, take all your tools.
They're really strong.

274
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,308
"They"?

275
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,809
Ga Mo-tak wasn't alone?

276
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,644
He was with a girl and a kid.

277
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,233
Jeez, how scary.

278
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,487
A girl and a kid? Goodness.

279
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,197
What the… That's my car.

280
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,074
See? I told you.

281
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,825
You were here! Jeez.

282
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,786
I'm very confused.

283
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,828
Hey, Chang-gyu!

284
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,955
It's this house here.

285
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,125
Come on.

286
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,964
Aren't you cold? Are you okay?

287
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,341
Yes, I'm fine.

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,805
Hi, kids.

289
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,475
Dan-o.

290
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:29,983
No one else's here?

291
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,486
It's okay.

292
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,279
Don't be scared, sweetie.

293
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,455
Jeon Gi-hwan, age 80.

294
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,374
Cause of death, exsanguination.

295
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
What a sicko.

296
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,254
Look at him shredded to pieces.

297
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,925
Like you said,

298
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,177
a human couldn't have done this.

299
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,388
Ma'am, the culprit behind this…

300
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,641
I'm really scared.

301
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,893
Shouldn't we form a task force?

302
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,191
Let's think about it
after gathering all the info first.

303
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,109
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,655
Well, this is the suspect's footprint.

305
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,074
The shoe size is 275 mm.

306
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,910
Estimated height, around 180 cm.
Weight, under 65 kg.

307
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,329
Traces of engine oil, metal, and glass
were found

308
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,665
in the footprint,
like Chairman Jeon's bloodstain.

309
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,875
-Engine oil?
-Yes.

310
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,835
I'm thinking it's probably

311
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,880
from an automobile factory
or a car repair shop.

312
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,841
Did you check the security footage?

313
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,009
You need to see this.

314
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,598
Well…

315
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,851
Moments after leaving
Chairman Jeon's house,

316
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,187
the suspect disappears.

317
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,355
-He disappeared?
-Yes.

318
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,066
He was last seen in this alley.

319
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,651
After that, he vanished.

320
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,120
It's about time you taught him a lesson.

321
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,664
If you can't do it yourself,

322
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,499
my boys can help you.

323
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,441
Sin.

324
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,031
Father.

325
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,046
That was very unlike you.

326
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,133
You always did
exactly what you were told to do.

327
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,644
Drink up.

328
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,195
You must turn away
when you're drinking with your elders.

329
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,426
Sin, remind me how old you are now.

330
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,636
I'm 26.

331
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:50,684
You can keep track when you don't
even have a social security number?

332
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,145
I have you, Father.

333
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,898
Many punks with social security numbers
don't have fathers.

334
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,744
You still have that wallet?

335
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,789
I may not have a social security number,
but I have this.

336
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,667
What is that?

337
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,297
The ticket to the game
we saw together when I was 10.

338
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,636
Gosh, you fool.

339
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,848
Why do you trust me?

340
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,018
You do everything I tell you to do

341
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,896
when all I do is beat you up.

342
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,784
Drink up.

343
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,092
-Father.
-Don't turn around, you punk!

344
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,363
Father.

345
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,532
Were you trying to kill me?

346
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,408
Cheong-sin.

347
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,869
Were you actually trying to kill me?

348
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,663
Cheong-sin…

349
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,877
Father, go ahead and kill me if you can.

350
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,840
What are you waiting for?

351
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,893
Cheong-sin.

352
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,816
Cheong-sin… Don't kill me.

353
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,860
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,403
Forgive me.

355
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,446
I'm sorry. You know…

356
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,615
My son, Jun-yeong…

357
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,702
My son!

358
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,833
BAM!

359
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,960
I TOOK CARE OF JESSICA

360
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,962
Are we killing Jessica already?

361
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,674
Yes. It's only a matter of time
before she spills the secrets,

362
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,218
-so let's just kill her.
-Okay.

363
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,469
Unbelievable.

364
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,850
Noh Hang-gyu was the CEO of Dajeong ENC.

365
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,727
Who's that?

366
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,103
What?

367
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,148
Oh, it's nothing.

368
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,237
Hey, don't you think
we've cut him enough slack?

369
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,447
-Should we kill him?
-Go!

370
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,741
Hey, what? Why? Ouch!

371
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,992
-Tell us.
-Hey, let go!

372
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:54,993
Hey! Ouch!

373
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,914
-You'd better tell us.
-Hey, you jerk! That hurts!

389
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,676
I'm busy today.

390
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,969
I won't have time.

391
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,971
The blood analysis is done.

392
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,307
-Really?
-I'll come to you. Where are you?

393
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,602
All right. Come to Suil-dong, then.

394
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
I'll be there by five.

395
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,730
Last time, I…

396
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,959
-Hello?
-Can you do something about that habit

397
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,753
of hanging up on people?

398
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,713
Oh, did I hang up on you?

399
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,132
What were you saying?

400
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,176
Let's just talk later.

401
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,722
Hello? Hey!

402
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,518
My, that feels so gratifying.

403
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:07,727
What was that?

404
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,772
Jeez, this is going to bother me.

405
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,818
I mean, why bring up the past?

406
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,947
Is she making fun of me
for not remembering a thing? Jeez.

407
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,117
Gosh.

408
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,040
-The one on the right.
-Jeez, you scared me.

409
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,543
Oh, is this the case file?

410
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,460
Yes.

411
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,463
Why would you hide it? You're mean.

412
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,881
Mun.

413
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,800
Men look most dashing in black.

414
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,971
Oh, right. Did you know that Dajeong ENC
is Noh Chang-gyu's company?

415
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,013
Dajeong ENC?

416
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,474
Remember the vest
the demolition crew was wearing?

417
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,600
Oh, really?

418
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,310
Yes, it's a demolition company.

419
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,438
The current CEO is Noh Chang-gyu,

420
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,607
but before him… Drumroll.

421
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,735
-Noh--
-Did Noh Hang-gyu serve as CEO?

422
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,820
Correct. The company was founded in 2005,

423
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,780
and he served as CEO until 2014.

424
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,615
Then he handed it over to his brother.

425
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,284
Did you look it up or something?

426
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,286
No, I could see where the story was going.

427
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,580
I see. Spoken like a true ex-cop.

428
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,125
I even stole my grandpa's
social security number to look it up.

429
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,585
Why did you look it up?

430
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,463
I was just curious about that man,
Noh Hang-gyu.

431
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,882
My parents' precinct
was on the lookout for him,

432
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,008
so I was curious.

433
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,928
It won't really help you solve
the Kim Yeong-nim case,

434
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,221
but I wanted to tell you.

435
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,682
Who knows? It could be helpful.

436
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,812
So a demolition thug is now
an executive at a construction company?

437
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,690
Right. At Taesin, which is a big company.

438
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,400
Something's fishy, right?

439
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,277
What's fishy? You silly goose.

440
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,613
Go train.

441
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,114
I'll be back by six.

442
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,659
You have to be in Suil-dong by five
because of the blood analysis results.

443
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,830
You little rascal.

444
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,123
Can I please tag along?

445
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,584
I really want to see
how investigations are done.

446
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,170
I'll train twice as hard when we get back.

447
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,173
Fine, I'll train until tomorrow morning.

448
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,175
Yung's territory! Okay!

449
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,969
-I'll summon it.
-If you do that, I'll think about it.

450
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,764
I'll give it a shot when we're back.
Like this!

451
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,391
I can do it!

452
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,311
-Let's go.
-Nice! Let's go!

453
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,647
But not in that uniform.

454
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,357
-Go get changed.
-Okay!

455
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,943
-You have 10 seconds.
-I promise I won't be a nuisance!

456
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,444
-Ten.
-Hold on! Wait up.

457
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,947
-Nine, eight!
-Wait! Gosh.

458
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,573
-I'll change on the way.
-Seven!

459
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,787
Four of them were contaminated
and therefore not analyzable.

460
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,706
But this sample is Kim Yeong-nim's blood.

461
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,750
No drugs or toxicants were found.

462
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,837
But she was pregnant at the time.

463
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,840
-Pregnant?
-That's right.

464
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,260
We were also able to analyze this sample,

465
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,512
but this blood belongs to someone else.

466
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,806
A male, blood type AB.

467
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,432
BLOOD TYPE AB

468
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,977
And this one is animal blood.

469
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,144
Animal blood?

470
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,188
That's so odd.

471
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,775
RESULTS

472
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,827
What are you so engrossed in?

473
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,248
I was thinking,
"This is what the police do."

474
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,499
You know?

475
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,419
"This is the kind of work
that my mom and dad did."

476
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,879
That too, right?

477
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,384
Could her pregnancy have been
what got her killed?

478
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,928
It's possible,

479
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,639
in a relationship where pregnancy
shouldn't have happened.

480
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,474
A married man.

481
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,311
Noh Hang-gyu is probably married.

482
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,315
I'm very uncomfortable talking
about stuff like this with you, kiddo.

483
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,775
Given his social status
as a Taesin executive,

484
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,277
if he cheated on his wife,

485
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,154
-do you think--
-Gosh, I feel so uneasy.

486
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,864
Why would this make you uneasy?

487
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,866
I'm all grown up. You're weird.

488
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,329
First off, we have no evidence
to consider Noh Hang-gyu as a suspect

489
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,456
in the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

490
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,750
You started with a false premise.

491
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,877
But he killed you!

492
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,796
We don't know whether or not
Kim Yeong-nim was the reason.

493
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,382
We're missing the link.

494
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,426
I see.

495
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,511
Don't get all fired up, Mun.

496
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,846
I can't help it.

497
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,183
A blood sample that may belong
to the suspect. A male, blood type AB.

498
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,643
You're all fired up too.

499
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,979
We don't even know whether that man
really is a suspect,

500
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,230
Detective So.

501
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,901
I know that he is.

502
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,488
How do you know?

503
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,783
My intuition as a detective's son.

504
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,578
You silly rascal.

505
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,084
I'm sure there were other ways even if
she wasn't supposed to be pregnant.

506
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,919
Why kill her?

507
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,508
Hold on.

508
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,261
Back then, he was a mere thug,
not a Taesin executive.

509
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,306
He served as Dajeong ENC's CEO
until 2014, right?

510
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,811
Hey, look up Taesin Construction.

511
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,728
Yes, sir.

512
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,881
Wait here for a minute.

513
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,924
Oh, sure.

514
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,938
Did this person
evaporate into thin air or what?

515
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,649
Who evaporated into thin air?

516
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,027
Hi.

517
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,904
We found some blood samples at the scene.

518
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,574
Run them through NFS' database.

519
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,034
A male, blood type AB.

520
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,662
BLOOD TYPE AB, MALE

521
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,290
So they found blood
that doesn't belong to Kim Yeong-nim?

522
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,502
It's not an official case though.
Will the NFS accept it?

523
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:09,714
I'll send this along with
the ones I'm working on now.

524
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,633
A homicide case?

525
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,513
Oh, I see.

526
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,475
I guess you were following
the suspect's foot tracks.

527
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,102
Well, you know…

528
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,274
Look at this.

529
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,486
Powdered glass.

530
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:32,987
Right?

531
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,117
Who's the suspect?
These foot tracks are pretty unique.

532
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,998
Looks like it stops here.

533
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,338
Where was he last seen
in the security footage?

534
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,548
Can you please leave now?

535
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,886
Hey, Han-ul.

536
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,021
Darn it.

537
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,982
Okay, I'll head back right away.

538
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,111
I have to rush back to the office.

539
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,279
Let me see a photo of the victim.

540
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,240
You know that I can't show you.

541
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,618
-Come on.
-I'll call you, okay?

542
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,329
Jeong-yeong. Hey, Detective Kim!

543
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,217
Is she that detective?

544
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,513
Mun.

545
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,106
Right, I heard you won't speak.

546
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,819
So, I'm going to ask you a few questions.

547
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,821
Can you write down your answers?

548
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,370
He thinks it's his fault
that his parents died.

549
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,207
That's why he won't speak.

550
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:12,879
Mun.

551
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,615
Mun!

552
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,242
Yes!

553
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,290
What was she doing here?

554
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,126
-Who?
-That female detective.

555
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,588
She's the detective who handled
our accident case.

556
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,381
-Really?
-Yes.

557
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,178
Hey, Mun.

558
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,180
Look.

559
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:12,146
-See these foot tracks left by a suspect?
-"Foot tracks"? Like footprints?

560
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,857
Yes. And see the powdered glass here?

561
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:21,113
It starts over there
and comes all the way here.

562
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,366
This is the last footprint.

563
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:24,825
After this…

564
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,791
And from there…

565
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,838
An evil spirit?

566
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,758
-The suspect is an evil spirit?
-Let's find him.

567
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,551
Mo-tak.

568
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,476
Hi, kiddo.

569
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,242
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

570
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:09,453
My gosh.

571
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,580
Well done.

572
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,875
We'll wrap it up,

573
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,919
so you guys can go home and rest.

574
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,714
Hey, bring everything.

575
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:20,631
Yes, sir.

576
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,509
-Do we have everything?
-Yes.

577
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,818
Why is Chief

578
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,071
having Mr. Pyo take over our case?

579
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,283
I suppose it's a case they must bury.

580
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,704
This sicko isn't even human.
Why protect such a murderer?

581
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,878
If the suspect isn't the reason
they must bury this…

582
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,672
The victim?

583
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,283
JEON GI-HWAN,
THE HISTORY OF JUNGJIN

584
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,546
THE BEGINNING OF HAPPINESS AND CHANGE
A NEW START

585
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,633
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

586
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,385
Kim Yeong-nim?

587
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,477
AUTOPSY REPORT

588
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,188
RESULTS

589
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,731
JEON GI-HWAN
AGE 80, MALE

590
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,275
BLOOD TYPE AB

591
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:08,030
We found some blood samples at the scene.
Run them through NFS' database.

592
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,281
A male, blood type AB.

593
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,199
BLOOD TYPE AB

594
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,243
BLOOD TYPE AB

595
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,294
You'll be able to track the suspect again
starting with the footage

596
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,798
from the camera
by Yeonhui Pharmacy on Suil 6-ro.

597
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,177
Please let me know
when you identify the victim.

598
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,104
Are we collaborating with her?

599
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,898
We'll summon the evil spirit,

600
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,317
and Detective Kim will catch the culprit.

601
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,612
Right, Jeong-yeong.
Her name is Kim Jeong-yeong, right?

602
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,365
You remember her name?

603
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,534
She visited me a number of times.

604
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,120
But because of my aphasia,

605
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,498
I couldn't even say a word
when she was interviewing me.

606
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,876
I didn't want to say anything.

607
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,549
How do you know her?

608
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,803
Stop prying, will you?

609
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,351
I bet you picked that shirt
to impress her.

610
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,437
-Are you two dating?
-No, you punk!

611
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,314
That's a yes, right?

612
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,774
What is it, then? The PD phase?

613
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,195
"PD phase"?

614
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,323
Gosh, the pre-dating phase.

615
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,785
The post-dating phase, I guess?

616
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,957
Come to think of it, why are you
suddenly digging into your past?

617
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,083
The phone too.

618
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,212
You had put it behind you for seven years.
Why now?

619
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,883
-Ms. Chu is so against you digging it up.
-I said, stop prying.

620
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,718
That's not for kids.

621
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,845
-Put that down.
-I've seen stuff like this.

622
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,138
-Go home.
-Jeez!

623
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,431
Wait, hang on.

624
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,313
This…

625
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,234
Where was this taken? What is this photo?

626
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,444
I'm thinking

627
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,823
it's evidence that shows
how Kim Yeong-nim's corpse was abandoned.

628
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,116
Why do you ask?

629
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,452
My dad had this footage, which I found

630
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,205
on the memory card
hidden inside his notebook.

631
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,128
Why did my dad

632
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,714
have this footage?

633
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,509
I mean…

634
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,886
Why is it that you…

635
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,977
How is this related
to the Kim Yeong-nim case?

636
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:49,900
Mun.

637
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,239
The case was buried
even though detectives were killed.

638
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:56,699
"Detectives"?

639
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,702
There's someone else who died?

640
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:01,662
Yes,

641
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,372
a former colleague of mine.

642
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,499
A colleague? Did this detective die

643
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,460
while working on the Kim Yeong-nim case
with you?

644
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:13,966
Don't tell me…

645
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,802
You said there were

646
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,638
other detectives who died.

647
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,474
Were they my parents?

648
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,270
Wait.

649
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,774
My parents were killed,
but they covered it up?

650
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,693
So it wasn't an accident?

651
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,657
What's the thing you hid from me?

652
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,200
-Mun.
-What are you hiding here?

653
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,952
-It's nothing.
-Let go!

657
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,449
Say something!

658
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
That's right.

659
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,794
Your parents' deaths…

660
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,798
It wasn't an accident.

661
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,802
They were murdered.

662
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,436
Mun.

663
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,775
But why…

664
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,028
Why?

665
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,577
Who killed them?

666
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,163
Noh Chang-gyu or Noh Hang-gyu?

667
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,084
You knew all along, didn't you?

668
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,672
You all knew.

669
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,882
How…

670
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,427
How could you do this?

671
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,515
Why didn't you tell me when you knew
everything? How could you do this to me?

672
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,148
I can't read it
if you don't remember it.

673
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,192
You wanted to forget it,
so you blocked it out.

674
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,110
But you know.

675
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,820
You heard his voice.

676
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,239
I did?

677
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,534
I heard his voice?

678
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,495
That's right.

679
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,124
What can I do
to unlock the memory so you can see it?

680
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,375
I don't know what to do.

681
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,587
What do I do?
I must find out who killed my parents!

682
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,713
My mom and dad…

683
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,968
-Let go!
-Mun!

00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,450
Hello?

687
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,996
Ung-min, Ju-yeon. I need your help.

688
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,040
Hey, Mun. What's wrong?

689
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,709
-Where are you?
-Where are you now?

690
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,919
Hey, tell me where…

691
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,421
-I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?

692
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,109
Gosh, what do we do now?

693
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,558
I must unlock my memory.

694
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,853
Unleash the memory.

695
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,524
Unleash the darn memory!

696
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,821
Unleash the memory!

697
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,244
What's wrong?

698
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,497
I…

699
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,750
-I don't remember.
-What's wrong, Mun?

700
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,710
What happened?

701
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,296
My mom and dad…

702
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,341
I saw the person
who killed my parents, but I…

703
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,677
I don't remember anything.

704
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:11,638
No, Mun.

705
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,557
It wasn't your fault.

706
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,312
It's my fault that my parents were killed.

707
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,147
-No, that's not true.
-No, no.

708
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,274
You did nothing wrong.

709
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,735
-It wasn't your fault.
-It is my fault!

710
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,861
Let it all out.

711
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:29,906

Hello.

Hi, guys. Come on in.

716
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,262
Jeez, that punk.
He needs to return my shirt.

717
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,557
I wonder if Mun went to school.

718
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,558
Who cares?

719
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,977
You fart when you lie.

720
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,854
Hey, there are customers here.

721
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,651
My gosh.

722
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,073
Let's sit here.

723
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:15,869
Your hair…

724
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,080
Nice perm.

725
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,624
We're ready to order.

This call cannot be connected…

728
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,132
His phone is off.

729
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,093
He may have turned it back on.

730
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,305
Already?

731
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,766
Stop calling.

732
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,267
Hey! Gosh.

733
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,694
Hey.

734
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,655
Let's go to Yung.

735
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,075
Yung? Why, all of a sudden?

736
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,911
We should help Mun meet his parents
as soon as possible.

737
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:01,498
That is the only way
we can help him pull himself together.

738
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,166
You're right.

739
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,585
They summon us
when they need our help urgently

740
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,921
but don't even care about
what we're dealing with.

741
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,340
Exactly. So let's go.

742
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,389
-Go by yourself.
-What?

743
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,640
Let's go together!

744
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,685
Gi-ran kept trying to reach me,
but I ignored her.

745
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,686
Why?

746
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,022
Because I was working on other stuff.

747
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,274
What other stuff?

748
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,192
Human affairs.

749
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,362
-I told you not to meddle in those things!
-Ouch!

750
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,949
Why won't you listen to me?
You guys are such troublemakers.

751
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,492
Gosh.

752
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,376
Are you a kid?

753
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,464
Yes.

754
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,592
What about the job? Are you quitting?

755
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,889
I honestly can't wrap my head around it.

756
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:03,226
Ms. Chu, Mo-tak, and even you
knew about it. How could you

757
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,061
-fool me together?
-We didn't.

758
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,396
I mean, could you?

759
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,107
If I were you,
I would've told you long ago.

760
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,405
Does putting the blame on us
make you feel better?

761
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,949
That's one irresponsible remark.

762
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,743
It's a good thing.

763
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,329
All your life, you beat yourself up
for their deaths.

764
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,415
But it really wasn't your fault,
so you're free now.

765
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,084
I almost swore at you just now.

766
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,504
Did you manage to retrieve your memory?

767
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,006
Did you hear the killer's voice?

768
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,136
What are you doing?

769
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,348
Let's go to your room.

770
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,225
My room? Why? Get out.

771
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,894
I want to show you the person
who killed your parents.

772
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,312
You want me to leave?

773
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,814
Good luck, then.

774
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,608
How will you do that?

775
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,984
Let go.

776
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,196
You'd better not be kidding me.
How will you do that?

777
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,990
Stop glaring at me, will you?

778
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,078
We just wanted to protect you.
Do you not see that?

779
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,371
Oh, who's that lady?

780
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:09,334
Come up with something.
Anything but a girlfriend.

781
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,672
-This is my girlfriend.
-What?

782
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,465
What? Really?

783
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,927
Say hi. This is my grandpa.

784
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:26,476
-Sorry, I have to get going. Take care.
-Hey, wait. Grandma's home, right?

785
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,770
-Your grandma?
-Come in. Please come on in.

786
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,564
-Come on in.
-But I…

787
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,606
Let's go inside.

788
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,900
Come on. Let's go inside.

789
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,986
-My gosh.
-Go on in.

790
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,116
Go ahead.

791
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,492
Go on in.

792
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,870
Come on in.

793
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:46,955
Welcome.

794
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,126
Say hi. This is my grandma.

795
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,794
Oh, hello.

796
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,255
-Who is that crazy wench, honey?
-My goodness.

797
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,340
Well, would you like anything to eat?

798
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,134
-How about some fruit?
-No, it's okay.

799
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,427
Let's go to my room.

800
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,806
What? My goodness.
Where's that girl going?

801
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,600
Honey! Where's that crazy girl going?

802
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,226
-Come on.
-Hey. My gosh!

803
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,274
Come in.

804
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,068
Hey.

805
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,322
Here, have some.

806
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,915
Mun. Let's leave the door ajar, okay?

807
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,000
That's what you do
when you have a lady over.

808
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:32,918
Okay.

809
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,011
What are you doing? Just leave it ajar.

810
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,930
We need to close it.

811
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,434
-Don't talk to me so casually.
-Okay.

812
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,357
-Yes!
-Keep the door ajar.

813
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,108
Okay, Grandpa.

814
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,663
Is there anything you had
with you inside the car that day?

815
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,290
-A drawing, maybe?
-Oh, right.

816
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:19,130
How much of my memory did you see?

817
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,133
Did you want to hide something?

818
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,761
No, not at all.

819
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,223
Bring the drawing.

820
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,438
Sit next to me.

821
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,777
No, not that close.

822
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,710
You blocked out the memory
because of your guilt.

823
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,087
Let it all go.

824
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,715
Only then can you see it.

825
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,054
One.

826
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,306
Two.

827
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,102
-Gosh, forget it.
-Jeez, you prick.

828
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,521
Hey. As soon as we arrive in Yung,

829
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,606
just get down on your knees.

830
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,151
Let's not yell like last time.
We'll just beg them.

831
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,360
Okay?

832
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,112
-Gosh, my joints.
-Goodness.

833
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,615
-One.
-Don't bother.

834
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,617
-Two.
-Hey, don't.

835
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,411
-Three.
-Jeez!

836
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,334
One, two…

837
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,919
Three.

838
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,051
Get down.

839
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,849
What are you folks doing?

840
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,561
You promised Mun that you'll help him
meet his parents!

841
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,313
Mun desperately wants to see them.

842
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,398
Why are you so slow?

843
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,567
We're trying to find them, Ms. Chu.

844
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,693
What do you mean?

845
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,570
Isn't it all on the list?

846
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,659
What's going on?

847
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:13,995
Is there a problem?

848
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,455
Mun's parents

849
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,457
never ascended.

850
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,301
Are you ready?

851
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,182
Ready to see the killer?

852
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:42,482
I need your hand.

853
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,591
I'll be right next to you.

854
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,680
One.

855
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,184
Two.

856
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,815
Three.

857
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:41,291
Mom, I made a storybook
about our family.

858
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,252
Really? A storybook?

859
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:47,338
-Yes, it's about our family trip.
-Mom.

860
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,674
Is that right?

861
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,093
Then it must be a story
about the three of us.

862
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:54,929
No, it's about me, Grandpa, and Grandma.

863
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,016
The two of you are always so busy.

864
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,894
That's why you couldn't join us
on this trip.

865
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,273
-Honey. We can join them, right?
-We sure can!

866
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,067
You've broken your promise so many times.

867
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,986
Come on, Mun!

868
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,323
Draw us in your storybook. Please?

869
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,574
We'll join you, for sure.

870
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,576
I mean it. Pinky swear. Come on.

871
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,244
My arm's getting tired.

872
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,502
-And you, Mom?
-Yes, sir!

873
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,587
I promise you that I'll be there as well.

874
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,048
Please draw us in your storybook.

875
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,382
Okay!

876
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,759
Then I shall draw you two.

877
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,886
-Yes!
-Nice!

878
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:38,223
My sweetheart, thank you so much.

879
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:43,269
-You may cry because you think it's unfair
-You may cry because you think it's unfair

880
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:48,566
-Unless you're number one
-Unless you're number one

881
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,944
You never

882
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:55,240
-Receive applause
-Receive applause

883
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,367
Hello?

884
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,409
Hey, Gwon.

885
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,828
What's wrong? Did something happen?

886
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,750
No. No!

887
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,139
No…

888
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,736
Mom.

889
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,492
No!

890
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,870
Mom! Wake up!

891
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,089
Mom!

892
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,134
Mom! Stay with me!

893
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:02,307
Mom! Mom…

894
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,893
Mom! Stay with me, Mom!

895
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:06,894
Mom.

896
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,106
Mom! Please, no…

897
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,984
Mom, Dad…

898
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,120
Mom.

899
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,956
Mom, Dad…

900
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:31,127
Mom, Dad! Stay with me!

901
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,713
Dad, Dad!

902
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:37,467
Stay with me, please! Dad!

903
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,136
Dad!

904
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,071
He's here.

905
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:21,844
Don't touch anything.

906
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,473
We'll have a problem
if you change the flow.

907
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,730
Oh, my. They're totally whacked.

908
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,066
Let's see.

909
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:39,445
Dead. Mission accomplished.

910
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,031
No need to double-check.

911
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,408
They're dead.

912
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,127
They never ascended?

913
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,420
What does that mean?

914
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,883
They're either roaming the netherworld

915
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,387
or have become evil spirits.

916
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,144
It's also possible that
they were eaten by evil spirits.

917
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,112
That's all we can tell you at the moment.

918
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:22,697
Evil spirits?

919
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,716
My parents' souls…

920
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,886
He just swallowed them, didn't he?

921
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,683
So the killer is an evil spirit?

922
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,107
Shall I kill the kid in the back seat?

923
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,360
Don't bother. I don't care.

924
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,322
Is that man…

925
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:06,824
No way.

926
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,795
It's that guy.

927
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,007
Pretty good.

928
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,805
It's that guy. He killed Cheol-jung.

929
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,098
It's him.

930
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,152
You're that bitch.

931
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,990
There's no way he can see me.

932
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,243
It's you.

933
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,710
Mun, we have to get out of here. He's…

934
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:02,880
This bastard is…

935
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,468
I'll remember your face so I can find you

936
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,264
and tear you to shreds, bitch.

937
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,835
You son of a bitch!

938
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,380
Mun, no!

939
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,802
Mun, don't do that!

940
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,517
You must be that kid.

941
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,635
Why is life so cruel to this kid?

942
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,595
An evil spirit captured Mun's parents.

943
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,013
Is that the guy?

944
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,974
-We need to catch him pronto.
-This bastard…

945
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,018
He killed someone again.

946
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,686
What happened?

947
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,730
I think they're looking to throw down.

948
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,856
Shoot them dead.

949
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,193
Who is it?
Who's the one that stabbed Mo-tak?

950
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:49,695
-The head honcho over there.
-How dare you come here,

951
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,947
you bastard.

952
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,949
I spotted one.

953
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:54,742
Who's that?

954
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,202
My uncle.

955
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,246
