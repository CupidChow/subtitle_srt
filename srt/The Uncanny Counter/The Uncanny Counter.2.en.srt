1
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,811
Who is that girl we saw today?

2
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,564
-I can't tell you.
-You can't?

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,776
Then don't tell me.
I'll make you spill the truth.

4
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,236
You jerks!

5
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,322
Stop hitting Mun!

6
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,076
Mun, who is she? Just tell him!

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,203
If not, you might die!

8
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,331
You've done enough.

9
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,708
So, it's time for you to stop!

10
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,711
Cut your damn nonsense.
Where is she right now?

11
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,309
I've paid you back in full.

12
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,648
You son of a bitch.

13
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,275
What the hell is this guy saying?

14
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,362
-Damn it.
-Hey, get up.

15
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,030
It's all over now, okay?

16
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,408
What? "Stop"?

17
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,078
How dare you tell me to stop?

18
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,831
Hey, come here.

19
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,167
Keep showing me attitude!

20
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,795
I'm going to kill you.

21
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,341
-Hey, enough!
-Let go!

22
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,717
-Hey.
-I said, let go!

23
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,344
Hey, are you all right?

24
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,595
I'm going to kill you!

25
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,305
This is enough!

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,016
Hey, Mun.

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,476
Mun, are you okay?

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,602
Mun!

29
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,021
-Hey.
-Wake up!

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,190
Mun!

31
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,441
Is he dead?

32
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,195
-I told you to stop!
-Damn it!

33
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,197
God damn it.

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,449
The cops are here!

35
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,911
Who are those weirdos?

36
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,246
Wait, the cops are here?

37
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,583
I was just playing a prank on you.
Look at you all scared.

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,209
Who are you bastards?

39
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,087
Don't swear, kiddo.

40
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,006
What do you want?

41
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
That boy is a member

42
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,469
of our organization.

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,639
Your organization?

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,060
Eonni's Gang.

45
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,358
With an old fart like yourself
and that grandma?

46
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,903
Hold on. Isn't she that girl?

47
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,697
Jeez, you guys beat the crap out of him.

48
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,908
Kids these days are so cruel.

49
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,910
This could kill someone.

50
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,494
You'll go to jail.

51
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,246
Why should we go to jail?

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,748
That bitch should.

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,708
An adult hit a minor.

54
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,835
-Call the cops.
-Are you all right?

55
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,421
Just know that my dad is an assemblyman.

56
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,341
-Gosh.
-Jeez, you son of a bitch.

57
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,677
This is why the victims
can't report you guys.

58
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,430
I bet their parents are assholes too.

59
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,973
Total assholes, I'm sure.

60
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,141
Are you Mun's friend?

61
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,311
Yes. I'll carry him.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,938
It's okay.

63
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,690
Hey. What are you doing?

64
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,858
Where are you going?

65
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,611
Hey.

66
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,821
We're not done here. Stop.

67
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,908
Aren't you that bitch from earlier?

68
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,452
If you call me a bitch again,

69
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,830
I will actually kill you.

70
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,505
We always retaliate
when someone messes with any of us,

71
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,299
but we'll let this one go
since you guys are civilians.

72
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,261
However, we won't forgive you
if you bother him again.

73
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,516
I'm dead serious,

74
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,768
so don't you forget.

75
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,145
Oh, my. How scary.

76
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,355
We're scared to death!

77
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,358
-My gosh!
-Look at you, Mo-tak. You've matured.

78
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,819
They're kids, you know.

79
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,239
Mun has such a big heart.

80
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,492
He could've totally beat them to a pulp,

81
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,576
but he held back.

82
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,834
Don't forget to take that.

83
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,794
That gimp will need it.

84
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,462
Hey, that's mean but hilarious.

85
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,340
-Hey.
-Hey! Careful!

86
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,301
Mun, are you all right?

87
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,552
-Are you okay?
-Wake up!

88
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,680
-Mun, wake up. Mun!
-Are you all right?

89
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,848
My leg is gone.

90
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,309
Mun, are you all right?

91
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,020
It wouldn't be fun to beat them up here.

92
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,647
-Bye!
-Get up.

93
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,151
-Hey, you're so good at this.
-Bye.

94
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,611
Sorry. I apologize.

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,947
We'll get going.

96
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,824
Mo-tak.

97
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,744
Don't worry.

98
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,123
I shouldn't have called you.
I'm sorry, Mun.

99
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,292
Stop crying.

100
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,501
This isn't your fault.

101
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,047
Just one punch each.

102
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,058
You call that an apology?

103
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,476
Damn you!

104
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,615
You know that wasn't
a proper apology, right?

105
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,662
Hey, go easy on them.

106
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,916
Let's erase their memory
before our territory disappears.

107
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,877
No, let them suffer a little longer.

108
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,340
Pain must be shared!

109
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,305
Go home.

110
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,057
Let me come with you.

111
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,600
It's getting late.

112
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,310
He'll call you when he wakes up.

113
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,608
It's wrong to let these kids off the hook.

114
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,860
Why are they even allowed to go to school?

115
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,278
Shouldn't they be suspended?

116
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,239
His dad is an assemblyman.

117
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,535
Korea ranks number one amongst countries
when it comes to protecting assailants.

118
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:54,122
My arm's broken. It's broken!

119
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,875
We can lose the counter
for hurting civilians, you know.

120
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,754
Gosh, those jerks in Yung
should really give us some leeway.

121
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,217
They aren't interested to know
what really goes on out in the field.

122
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,848
Let's see, you little rat.

123
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,432
No, don't! No!

124
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,725
-No.
-Get some sleep.

125
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,810
No!

126
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,069
All right. Next up is you, rooster.

127
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,406
Don't hurt me. Please spare my life!

128
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,741
-Hey, I never said I was gonna kill you.
-I'm sorry.

129
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,410
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,830
You should've said that to Mun.

131
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,583
Don't apologize
just because we're stronger.

132
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,835
You should apologize
to the person you wronged.

133
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,879
Got it, Mr. Assemblyman's son?

134
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,088
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,840
Please forgive me…

136
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,393
All right. Next!

137
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,562
My dad is the mayor!

138
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,148
He's Mayor of Jungjin!

139
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,567
So you'd better not mess with me.

140
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,071
King of Jungjin, Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi?

141
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,782
Yes, that's my dad. My dad is--

142
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
Okay, I heard you.

143
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,665
People applaud your dad
for being such a wonderful man,

144
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:25,004
whereas you're being slapped
left and right for being a piece of trash.

145
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,133
You won't remember us when you wake up,

146
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,720
but I hope you'll remember
this tiny amount of pain

147
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,723
so you can become a better person.

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,445
Our territory is disappearing.

149
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,405
I should go treat Mun as well.

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,450
We've erased their memory,
so let's just leave.

151
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,077
You pummeled these boys.

152
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,456
Oh, dear.

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,296
Oh, boy.

154
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,342
This is getting harder with age.

155
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,345
Why can't I develop healing powers?

156
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,180
This is too much for you.

157
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,391
We all got powers
that suit our personalities.

158
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,685
You're strong,
like a dumb but tough fighter.

159
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,272
Was that a compliment?

160
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,773
Yes, of course. That's a compliment.

161
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,650
Oh, boy. Gosh.

162
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,360
Let's see. Oh, boy.

163
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,153
-Wrong side.
-Oh, really?

164
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,784
All right. Jeez, this stupid rooster.

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,391
He's woken up.

166
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,524
How…

167
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,068
How did I end up here?

168
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,071
You were beaten up and fainted,
so we brought you here.

169
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,699
Come join us for some noodles.

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,583
-Ouch!
-Jeez.

171
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,168
What are you doing?

172
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,254
Well…

173
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,550
This is weird.

174
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,385
You've forgotten

175
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,471
how to walk properly?

176
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,973
I promised you I'd heal your leg.

177
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,086
-Ouch!
-My gosh.

178
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,941
Come on.

179
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,593
I'm walking.

180
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,098
I can walk.

181
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm going to step out.

182
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,939
Hey, slow down.

183
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,733
Watch out!

184
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,611
EONNI'S NOODLES

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,529
My gosh.

186
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,491
Mun! You shouldn't be running yet!

187
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,626
He's not going to listen to us now.

188
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,310
Hurry up, Mun!

189
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,188
-Mun!
-Hurry up!

190
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,026
Let's run away!

191
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,033
Mun!

192
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,710
-Aren't you tired?
-No.

193
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,588
You caught us!

194
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,998
Thank you

195
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,167
for the noodles

196
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,252
and also for my leg.

197
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
You must be hungry. Eat up.

198
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,221
Hey, what's with you?

199
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,067
Are you crying because of your leg?

200
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,445
Or is it because the noodles are too good?

201
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,908
I just feel bad for my parents.

202
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,629
Have your parents passed away?

203
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,841
Yes.

204
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,386
In a car accident.

205
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,598
I heard the other driver was drunk.

206
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,766
Is that when you hurt your leg?

207
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:54,935
Yes.

208
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,523
That must've been a lot for you to handle.

209
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,778
We've all been through that, Mun.

210
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,908
All of us here have had
a near-death experience.

211
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,409
We all suffered a lot.

212
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,788
We're all living with a wounded heart.

213
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,959
This guy here? He lost all his memory.

214
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,922
What? His memory?

215
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,548
My skull was crushed.

216
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,176
Apparently, I fell off a building.

217
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,678
What? And you survived?

218
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,306
Those two brought me back to life
to make me work.

219
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,808
But I wonder

220
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,187
how this kid got his foot
in the other realm.

221
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,857
You can only reach the afterlife

222
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,901
when you're in a coma.

223
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,820
That's right. We were all in a coma once.

224
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,074
I was also in a coma for a month
after the accident.

225
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,492
That doesn't count.

226
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,453
That was years ago.
You're not in a coma now.

227
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,038
When did the accident take place?

228
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,124
-Seven years ago.
-Seven years?

229
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,502
Seven years…

230
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,670
You too, right?

231
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,381
You two were in a coma in the same year.

232
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,716
His only lasted a month.
Mine lasted six months.

233
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,301
We're not at the same level.

234
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,678
It was longer than a month.

235
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,929
Maybe almost two months.

236
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,556
Look at you changing your word.

237
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,058
You punk.

238
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,435
Hey, it's not something
worth being competitive over.

239
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,853
Gosh, you men…

240
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,064
Oh, what about you?

241
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,524
How did you end up in a coma--

242
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,902
I just spotted one.

243
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,998
It's level one, so I can go alone.

244
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,666
I'll go with you.

245
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,919
Hey, can you tidy up and take Mun home?

246
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,172
Your leg is healed,
but don't run around just yet.

247
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,091
You have to be careful. Hey.

248
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,347
Where is it?

249
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,099
The redevelopment area in Ojin-dong.

250
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,560
-It'd be faster to run than drive.
-See you.

251
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,280
What did she spot?

252
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,532
An evil spirit.

253
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,076
What? They went to capture an evil spirit?

254
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,620
You don't want to be a counter.

255
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,205
That's what you said.

256
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,710
What does "level one" mean?

257
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,170
Strong or weak?

258
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,214
Didn't you hear her saying
she could go alone?

259
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,174
It's a weak one.

260
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
I see.

261
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,511
Then what's the highest level?

262
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,517
Earlier at the gym…

263
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,104
Why allow them to beat you up
when you could've whacked them?

264
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,814
-What?
-Hey.

265
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,026
Don't you know you have your power now?

266
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,069
Power?

267
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,864
Our physical abilities are three times
as strong as ordinary people's.

268
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,534
Where is she right now?

269
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,621
Something…

270
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,040
did feel a bit off.

271
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,377
Throw a jab.

272
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,796
-What?
-Do it.

273
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,297
Gosh.

274
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,971
Are you kidding me?

275
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,183
Stand firm and jab as hard as you can.

276
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,477
Fine. A real jab this time.

277
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
Try again.

278
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,210
What?

279
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,719
What do you say?

280
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,181
Want to meet an evil spirit?

281
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,606
Level one means the evil spirit
entered a human body recently.

282
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,401
The human can't even sense
the evil spirit.

283
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,319
So stage one is before they kill anyone.

284
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,656
Right. And they're not strong,
so it's not hard to capture them.

285
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,533
They must be caught at this stage

286
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,661
because their abilities can get
a huge boost from just one murder.

287
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,621
And that's level two?

288
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,958
That's right. Then they become fascinated
with their powers and go crazy.

289
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,010
Hey, I told you to take it easy
and not run so fast!

290
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,261
I can't control my legs.

291
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,971
I don't know how fast I can run.

292
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,806
-Hey, easy!
-Gosh!

293
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,313
Wow! That was sick! Did you see--

294
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,272
You little punk.

295
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,650
-We're here too.
-"We"?

296
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,694
I'm here too.

297
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,863
I told you he'd come.

298
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,657
-What are we looking for?
-Right.

299
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,534
He's wearing a gray shirt
and regular pants.

300
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,702
A plastic bag is 20 won.

301
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,662
-Do you need one?
-Just hand it over.

302
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,706
Want to get killed for 20 won?

303
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,042
And he has a large mole
on the back of his neck.

304
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,794
He bought soju and snacks
at a store with a kid

305
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,421
and went into an alley.

306
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,715
He already seemed quite drunk.

307
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,433
Oh, okay.

308
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,941
Inhale. Three.

309
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,656
Son, let's eat some chicken.

310
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,740
-Okay.
-Careful, it's hot.

311
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,700
-Honey, pass me the cola.
-Cola? Here.

312
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
Eat up.

313
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,828
A large mole on the back of his neck…

314
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,455
Eat up.

315
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,085
What kind of snack did the kid get?

316
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,254
Are you seriously curious about that now?

317
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,673
It could lead us to a clue.

318
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,342
There are many empty houses
because of the redevelopment.

319
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,011
Look carefully, okay?

320
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,700
Stop playing that game and go study!

321
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,498
Found him.
Across the street from the sauna.

322
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,624
Okay, roger that.

323
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,018
KKOBUGI

324
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,519
Ha-na.

325
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,689
Did the boy get Kkobugi?

326
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:56,690
What?

327
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,693
What is it?

328
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,947
Oh, the boy…

329
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
I told you he's an adult.

330
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,661
-Die!
-No.

331
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,080
-I mean, this woman here--
-We're looking for a man.

332
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,125
This woman is killing someone.

333
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,669
-Mun.
-Gosh.

334
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,671
The boy isn't moving either.

335
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,675
I'll go to where Mun is.
You two, keep searching.

336
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,594
I should go in.

337
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,220
-The kid is…
-Mun.

338
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,598
-The boy is…
-No, wait.

339
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,809
Mun, don't do anything.

340
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,437
-Don't do anything until I get there!
-Shit.

341
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,652
Mun!

342
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,072
-Wait!
-Just die!

343
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,656
Let's end things now.

344
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,825
Die!

345
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,746
I want you dead! Die.

346
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,039
Just die!

347
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,875
Die! Just die. Die.

348
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,711
Kiddo, are you all right?

349
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,588
Hey, kiddo. Wake up. Hey!

350
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,798
Die!

351
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,676
Die! Just die. Die.

352
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,994
You little…

353
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,162
Dad, stop!

354
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,050
Seong-hyeon!

355
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,517
Die!

356
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,033
Mo-tak, what do we do?

357
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,410
He's not breathing.

358
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,953
Mun!

359
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,080
Darn it.

360
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,207
What happened?

361
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,334
This bastard.

362
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,879
He's not dead.

363
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,465
Ms. Chu, have a look.

364
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,136
My gosh.

365
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,056
Seong-hyeon.

366
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,351
Put her to sleep.
He's in critical condition.

367
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,227
Mun.

368
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,146
This boy…

369
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,690
You saved his life.

370
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,766
We almost lost that boy
to the evil spirit.

371
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,407
You're pretty good.

372
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,495
I'll summon him.

373
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,585
Is that…

374
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,297
the evil spirit?

375
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,673
What a shame.

376
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,092
I could've eaten that boy's soul.

377
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,210
Who are you people?

378
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,546
Listen.

379
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,716
If you keep living like this,

380
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,928
whether it be you, your husband,
or that boy…

381
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,805
One of you will die.

382
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,062
I just want to tell you this one thing.

383
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,815
All of us here

384
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,067
are on your side.

385
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,989
Don't hit Seong-hyeon.

386
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,200
And don't hit me either.

387
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,079
Both Seong-hyeon and I
won't put up with it anymore.

388
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,540
We don't want to see you ever again!

389
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,419
If I see you again,
even though I failed today…

390
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,088
Next time, I won't fail.

391
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,509
That won't happen.

392
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,637
Don't dirty your hands

393
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,389
just to punish an evil bastard.

394
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,141
We're on your side.

395
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,573
Mun, you saved that boy's life today.

396
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,660
Exactly. Thanks to him, we saved that boy
and captured the evil spirit.

397
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,539
That's right. Thanks to you,
their lives totally changed overnight.

398
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,791
This is the work we do.

399
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,590
Ha-na, do you have anything to say?

400
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,677
Will you be a counter or not?

401
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:26,931
Good job today.

402
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,308
-Thank you.
-Yes.

403
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,685
He was born for this, don't you think?

404
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,147
Will you do it or not? Ouch!

405
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,858
Well, take some time

406
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,944
to think about what you did today
and make a decision.

407
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,405
Here.

408
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,158
You have a week, you know.

409
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,885
I'll think about it.

410
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,013
-Okay, great.
-What's there to think about?

411
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,515
Just say yes, you little punk.

412
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,391
EONNI'S NOODLES

413
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,770
All right, then. Get home safely.

414
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,729
Take care.

415
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,481
We erased those bullies' memory.

416
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,274
-They must not find out.
-Don't worry.

417
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,527
You don't need a week. Decide by tomorrow.

418
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,321
If you want to do it,
come to the overpass tomorrow morning.

419
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,405
That's where we train.

420
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,699
If you don't come,
we'll find another member.

421
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,951
What? Tomorrow?

422
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,327
Yes, you've got a day.

423
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,538
If you don't come,
we'll erase your memory.

424
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,206
Jeez, go back inside.

425
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,833
It means no more noodles for you!

426
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,335
You'd have to wait forever in line…

427
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,337
Where did that punk go?

428
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,300
-Get back inside!
-That punk.

429
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,015
Hey, why are you so impatient?

430
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,018
We should just wait patiently

431
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,064
until that kid has an awakening
while giving him the support he needs.

432
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,024
Why do you think Wi-gen gave him a week?

433
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,943
Of course, you know nothing about kids.

434
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,778
He should man up. Just say yes or no.

435
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,698
-Ha-na, why don't you go and--
-I don't want to.

436
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,657
Mo-tak, then you…

437
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,830
Jeez. I have to do all the work, don't I?

438
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,833
ONLY OPEN WHILE SUPPLIES LAST

439
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,808
-Mun-yeong!
-Gosh, Grandma!

440
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,020
My gosh, Mun-yeong isn't home yet.

441
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,313
I should go look for her.

442
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,898
-Mun-yeong.
-Grandma!

443
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,232
I'll go find Mun-yeong.

444
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,151
-Let's go inside. It's cold.
-No.

445
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,736
-Mun-yeong!
-Grandma, please.

446
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,862
You'll catch a cold.

447
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,280
Gosh, let me go.

448
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,740
Grandma, please!

449
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,325
-My daughter--
-I heard you.

450
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,536
-Where did Mun-yeong go?
-Grandma, I'll go find her.

451
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,497
-Gosh, Mun-yeong.
-Grandma! It's me, Mun.

452
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,541
Look, Grandma. It's me, Mun.

453
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,794
Grandma.

454
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,130
Look at me.

455
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,216
I can walk now.

456
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,635
Look.

457
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,643
What do you think? Isn't it fascinating?

458
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,894
I can even do this.

459
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,490
Grandma, what's wrong?

460
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
Do you remember me now?

461
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,077
Do you recognize me?

462
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,621
No, I don't.

463
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,126
Then why are you crying?

464
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,963
I don't know.

465
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,924
I'm just happy.

466
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,680
You're happy?

467
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,558
Yes, I'm happy.

468
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,063
My gosh! There you are.

469
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,777
Honey, I thought you went out again.

470
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,446
Gosh, you scared me for a second.

471
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,074
What? Did you cry?

472
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,036
I caught her as she was leaving the house
to look for Mom.

473
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,831
My gosh. Come on. Let's go inside.

474
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,041
Why are you getting in so late?

475
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,292
I'm sorry.

476
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,169
-Have you had dinner?
-Yes, I have.

477
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,713
I had super tasty noodles.

478
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,298
Really? That's great.

479
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,977
Mun.

480
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,020
This boy…

481
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,605
You saved his life.

482
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,745
One.

483
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,539
Two.

484
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
Three.

485
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,780
Are we too early?

486
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,323
We should've set a time. Jeez.

487
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,867
This isn't bad. We get to exercise.

488
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,287
I think we got too ahead of ourselves.

489
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,706
Gosh, must you be so negative?

490
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,713
He's here.

491
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,766
Of course. Why wouldn't he come?

492
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,059
I knew he'd come.

493
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,394
You were exercising on pins and needles.

494
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,403
First.

495
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,783
Do not use the powers to get your revenge.

496
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,244
Second.

497
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,247
You will not meddle in human affairs.

498
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,290
Third.

499
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,877
You must not tell anyone
that you are a counter.

500
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,214
If you violate any of these rules...

501
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,343
I will be stripped of my rights
as a counter.

502
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,852
I'll do it.

503
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,523
I will become a counter.

504
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,779
But on one condition.

505
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,577
-Condition?
-The others were brought back to life

506
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,163
in return for accepting the job.

507
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,457
Tell me.

508
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,418
What would you like, then?

509
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,631
I want to meet

510
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,968
my parents.

511
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,932
There's something I must tell them.

512
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,895
Mo-tak, Ha-na.

513
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,106
Let's groom him well.

514
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,568
He has no idea how dangerous this job is.

515
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,904
Let's keep him safe

516
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,032
and help him become a great counter.

517
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,707
Welcome!

518
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,424
Do you think…

519
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,260
I can do a good job?

520
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,347
You need to undergo hazing first.

521
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,806
Hazing?

522
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:10,269
-Mun.
-Yes.

523
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,729
See those handprints?

524
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,691
The green one is Ms. Chu's.
The red one is Ha-na's.

525
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,152
And the yellow one is mine.

526
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,029
What? That's insane.

527
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,449
All right, yours will be blue.

528
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,743
It was Cheol-jung's color.

529
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,373
The one who passed away?

530
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,085
Yes, Jang Cheol-jung.

531
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,423
But I don't see a blue handprint
on that wall.

532
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,926
Right. Why would that be?

533
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,135
We will officially

534
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,097
accept you as his successor
the day you find the answer.

535
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,226
Relax, it's your first time.

536
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,818
Ready.

537
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,947
And now…

538
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,184
What? A blue handprint!

539
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,395
The blue one! It's here!

540
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,689
This is Cheol-jung's handprint, right?

541
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,649
Wow! This is so cool!

542
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,610
-Yes! Wow.
-This is unbelievable, Mun.

543
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,071
My gosh! This is incredible!

544
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,072
Indeed!

545
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,825
Well done!

546
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,750
Ung-min, Kim Ung-min. Look at me.

547
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,793
Hey, look at me.

548
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,131
I knew this would happen.

549
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,425
I have to go see if Mun is okay.

550
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,677
Why? What happened to Mun?

551
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,638
They beat him to a pulp.

552
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,558
They should be locked up
for attempted murder.

553
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,561
I really thought they'd kill Mun.

554
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,813
Go to the police station.

555
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,440
You need to get this sorted out.

556
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,233
That won't help us.

557
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,527
They'll just beat us up more.

558
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,695
They almost killed him.

559
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,448
We have to protect Mun, you know.

560
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,866
That was our promise.

561
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,160
What's Mun going to do now?

562
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,245
After losing his parents,
he cried every time

563
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,247
he saw a truck or whenever he was alone.

564
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,249
He started getting better a few years ago.

565
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,418
Get your act together, Kim Ung-min.

566
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,338
Hey! Out of the way!

567
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,673
What are you looking at?

568
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,183
Go back to your classroom!

569
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,061
Back to your classroom, you morons!

570
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,277
That's Mun's class.

571
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,197
Get out.

572
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,449
Get the hell out.

573
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,410
What's going on?

574
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,874
Hey, what happened yesterday?

575
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,836
I know we were beating you up,

576
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:24,171
but that's all we remember.

577
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,131
Exactly.

578
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,049
And we woke up at the gym this morning.

579
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,051
What happened?

580
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,303
I don't know either.

581
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,389
I fainted, remember?

582
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,018
I don't like those haughty eyes.

583
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,189
You could get beaten up for that glare.
Didn't Mommy tell you?

584
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,192
She gave birth to a moron
who can't even run away,

585
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,777
so she should've taught you that.

586
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,656
You jerks!

587
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,829
Hey, punching bag.

588
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,252
Come here.

589
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,296
Hey, come here.

590
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,133
Don't hurt Ung-min.

591
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,804
Like I said yesterday,

592
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,306
this is between us.

593
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,599
Leave Ung-min out.

594
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,520
Hey.

595
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,689
Have you lost your mind?

596
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,236
You little piece of shit.

597
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,379
Are you humiliated?

598
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,925
You guys have been humiliating

599
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,801
everyone here all this time.

600
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,141
So don't you ever forget

601
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,976
how mortified you were today,

602
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,272
and don't hurt them again.

603
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,901
You guys can come for me.

604
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:11,612
But don't…

605
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,034
Don't hurt Ung-min ever again.

606
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,538
The same goes for Ung-min's friends.

607
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,875
His friends' friends too.
Don't hurt anyone at school,

608
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,879
ever.

609
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,841
If you hurt or bully anyone again,
I guarantee you…

610
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,513
You'll get it all back, twofold.

611
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,641
Mark my words.

612
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,565
Damn it.

613
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,276
God damn it.

614
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,365
Get out of the way!

615
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,124
I'm going to kill him.

616
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,586
I'm going to kill that bastard
at all costs.

617
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,138
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

618
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,140
They hurt you because of me.

619
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,683
No worries. I'm fine.

620
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,645
But I have to say, I'm impressed.

621
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,985
-Mun.
-What did I just see?

622
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,570
What happened?

623
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,487
What?

624
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,451
I just didn't want them
to keep walking all over us,

625
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,703
so I tried throwing a little jab.

626
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,455
And I guess…

627
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,249
I can fight.

628
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,168
Dude!

629
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,296
Hey, Ju-yeon!

630
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,676
Please, no more surprises.

631
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,975
There are five counters in the country.

632
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,647
You, Ms. Chu, Ha-na, and me.

633
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,650
And Mr. Choi Jang-mul,
who takes care of all our expenses.

634
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,734
I see.

635
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,445
Are there counters
in other countries as well?

636
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,156
Evil spirits are everywhere.

637
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,699
Oh, right.

638
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,036
Our physical abilities are three times
as strong as ordinary people's.

639
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,164
But it can vary
depending on how hard you train, so--

640
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,666
I must train hard.

641
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,503
There are times when our abilities
are increased fivefold.

642
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,963
When the territory shifts.

643
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,674
"Territory"?

644
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,218
When the energies of the divine
and human realms merge,

645
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,386
waves are created.

646
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,014
Only we can see our territory.
Yung's territory.

647
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,225
You've seen the waves too.

648
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,143
What?

649
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,062
Yesterday at the gym.

650
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,857
Look at that face. Goodness.

651
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,818
What the heck are you guys doing?

652
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:02,241
Yes! I saw it. Like the northern lights.

653
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,284
That's a territory shift.

654
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,911
I see.

655
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:08,705
When does that happen?

656
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,998
Can you make it happen?

657
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,708
It'll help us capture evil spirits.

658
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,168
We can't control it.

659
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,671
Like a sudden rain shower,
we never know when or where

660
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,965
it'll happen.
It happens randomly and disappears.

661
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,508
Usually, it lasts a few seconds,

662
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,219
but it can last over an hour
if you're lucky.

663
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,681
Can evil spirits see it too?

664
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,558
No, they can't. It's our territory.

665
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,686
Here's something more important.

666
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,274
If an evil spirit enters the territory
during one of those energy shifts,

667
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,317
we can sense it right away.

668
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,821
Wow, so I can sense evil spirits too?

669
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,781
All counters can, up to a few kilometers.

670
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,451
But when it comes to catching them…

671
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,954
That's usually Ha-na's job.
She can spot every evil spirit

672
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,248
within a radius of
a few hundred kilometers.

673
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,417
Can you get better with training?

674
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,212
We don't even know how to train for it.

675
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,298
-Darn it.
-Ha-na is very good at it.

676
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,674
At catching them.

677
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:01,884
And she's also very good

678
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,302
at reading memories.

679
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,013
We can only read a small portion
of others' memories,

680
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:10,142
but she can scan years' worth of memories
in just a few seconds.

681
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,020
She's an extremely sensitive one.

682
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,522
So Ha-na is good at catching evil spirits,

683
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,566
and Ms. Chu can heal others.

684
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,567
You are…

685
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,029
freakishly strong.

686
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,448
FREAKISHLY STRONG

687
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,076
What about me?

688
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,828
Why don't you find out?

689
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,749
Evil spirits are everywhere,

690
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,960
but there are a lot of them in Jungjin.

691
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,713
That's why we're here.

692
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:42,216
Why in Jungjin?

693
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,510
I'm not sure.

694
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,762
Maybe it's a sinful city?

695
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,146
There are many types of evil spirits.

696
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,775
The one who killed Cheol-jung
was level three.

697
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,401
Level three?

698
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,239
It means the spirit has eaten
four to five souls.

699
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,574
But it's all case by case.

700
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:12,162
Some stay at level two
even after killing more people.

701
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,624
If the evil spirit and the host
are very compatible,

702
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:18,085
they can reach level three more quickly.

703
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,713
Once they enter level three,
they can talk in two voices.

704
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,382
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

705
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,300
In two different voices?

706
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,803
And that can evolve

707
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,764
into the host and the evil spirit
becoming one.

708
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,140
That's level four.

709
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,643
But we haven't seen it yet.

710
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,604
Wasn't that your first time
seeing level three?

711
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,692
Then how strong is level four?

712
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,112
All of us would have to fight together
to beat it.

713
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,031
Only when we have our territory.

714
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,785
We might be able to do it
if Mun reaches Cheol-jung's level.

715
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:52,786
No.

716
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,913
Not without our territory.

717
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,127
I cannot lose another teammate.

718
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,719
Here, Mun.

719
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,596
He killed Cheol-jung.

720
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,352
This is…

721
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,607
Is this

722
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,150
a composite sketch?

723
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,234
Yes.

724
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,737
You think

725
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,365
you can catch him with this?

726
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,580
You're laughing?

727
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,001
No.

728
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,838
Can I see a different one?

729
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,265
MID-LENGTH HAIR, MOLE ON FACE, YOUNG

730
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,269
SHORT HAIR, SMALL EYES, FEMALE?

731
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,855
LOOKS OLD, FOREHEAD AND SMILE LINES
MID-LENGTH HAIR, MOLE ON FACE

732
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,570
You think they're funny?

733
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,830
He's looking down on us, right?

734
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,707
He sure doesn't respect us.

735
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,251
Hey, what's the problem?

736
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,879
Do you know how many spirits
we caught using these?

737
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,508
He's looking down on us too.

738
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,387
His face is on the narrow side, right?

739
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:48,110
Well, the chin too. It's more…

740
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,028
He has a square chin.

741
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,322
He has an oval face,
but it looks quite sharp.

742
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,368
And he has a high nose bridge.

743
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,747
The eyes. His eyes are slanted.

744
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,958
-Yes, that's it.
-He looks like a wolf.

745
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,876
Make the eyebrows thicker.

746
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,962
He's bald, but he was wearing a hoodie.

747
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,517
Done.

748
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,705
We must catch him.

749
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,291
Let's catch him

750
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,169
so Cheol-jung can rest in peace.

751
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,469
Shall we take a photo together?

752
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,600
Mun, you see…

753
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,061
I used to run a photography studio.

754
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:06,855
Really?

755
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,777
That's how I was able to raise my son,
put him through school,

756
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,529
and even send him to the Military Academy.

757
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,365
-That's so inspiring.
-Here we go.

758
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,201
Okay, ten seconds.

759
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,165
We won't lose anyone in this photo.

760
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,833
I promise you that.

761
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,591
What the heck?

762
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,470
Okay, let's try that again.

763
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,181
One more time.

764
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,891
Ta-da!

765
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,895
Let's pretend we're besties.

766
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,904
Don't touch me.

767
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,739
You can't touch Ha-na.

768
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,991
She doesn't want her memories to be read.

769
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,331
Hi, so you're Ha-na.

770
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,709
Gosh.

771
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,673
Hey, it's nice to meet you.
You must be Ha-na--

772
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,762
I wasn't trying to read your memories!

773
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,729
Mun, why don't you take her down

774
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,482
and read her memories?

775
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,152
I'll try.

776
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,035
Maybe I shouldn't have said I'd try.

777
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,543
What is this?

778
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,628
This is the basement?

779
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,091
My gosh, this is so cool.

780
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,486
You should warm up too.

781
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,405
Oh, okay.

782
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:24,159
One, two, three, four, five.

783
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,499
Let's do this.

784
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,251
Oh, you know…

785
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,421
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.
Mo-tak kept saying

786
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,756
I should give it a shot.

787
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,174
You wanted to take me down.

788
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,843
No, I only said that
because Mo-tak kept egging me on.

789
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,261
This is part of the training.

790
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,721
Come this way.

791
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,849
Gosh, please.

792
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:51,394
I won't dare to do this to you.

793
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,229
I've never even done this…

794
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,150
She's fast.

795
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,118
Hey, go put on the defense suit.

796
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,870
No, it's fine.

797
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,998
Okay, that's how you'll play this? Got it.

798
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,084
I have a third-poom belt in taekwondo.

799
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,134
I can't hear a thing.

800
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,594
Damn it.

801
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,767
I'll really show you now.

802
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,607
Here I come.

803
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,447
Shit.

804
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,328
You can't even get me once?

805
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,998
Gosh! Damn it.

806
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,542
Jeez.

807
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,559
No. Please, don't get the wrong idea.

808
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,060
No, please!

809
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,690
Oh, I just blocked you.

810
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,775
I did, right? I just blocked you.

811
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,527
What's wrong? What?

812
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,112
Gosh, no!

813
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,366
Class is over.

814
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,540
Your second class.

815
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,378
Thank you, Mo-tak.

816
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,591
You have a lot to learn.

817
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,592
Train harder, okay?

818
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,260
What the heck was that about?

819
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:48,928
Gosh, seriously.

820
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,434
Try to figure out

821
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,103
the best way to fall to lessen the pain.

822
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,397
How would I know? Why don't you teach me?

823
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,025
Bring it on!

824
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,526
Don't worry.

825
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,988
Your body will figure it out.

826
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,658
Damn it.

827
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,954
Jeez.

828
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:23,338
Good. You're resisting. Here we go!

829
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,133
Nice. If you're trying to escape…

830
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,845
Get off me!

831
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,063
-Tap!
-Hey, you can't tap out

832
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,608
-in real fights.
-Okay, fine. Tap!

833
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,740
Mun. Hey, Mun!

834
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,749
Go! Keep going!

835
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,419
Darn it.

836
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,179
Ouch, my chest…

837
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,539
Where did you come from?

838
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,502
Okay.

839
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,090
What just happened?

840
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,383
What? I did it!

841
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,635
I did it! Yes!

842
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,479
-Mun.
-Yes.

843
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,022
-Can I get some sleep?
-Okay.

844
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,816
Turn off the lights
before I start yelling at you.

845
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,817
Okay.

846
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,122
-Hey! Pass it to me!
-Hey!

847
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,582
-Over there.
-Here it comes!

848
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,669
-Nice!
-Nice.

849
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,548
-Hey.
-Pass it to me!

850
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,758
Hey, block him.

851
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,011
Hello, Ms. Chu.

852
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,139
Mun, we got a case.
Come to the front gate now.

853
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,600
-Pass the ball to Ung-min!
-Okay.

854
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,062
Mun! Can you throw the ball over?

855
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,740
Mun?

856
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,706
Another evil spirit?

857
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,625
-Calm down and hop in.
-Okay.

858
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,555
Guess what I'm having for dinner.

859
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,806
Take a guess.

860
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,516
-Soybean paste stew?
-Wrong.

861
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,434
Napa cabbage soup?

862
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,311
-Wrong.
-Gosh.

863
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,854
What is it, then?

864
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,523
Not telling you.

865
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,611
This one's quite heavy.

866
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,447
He's probably eaten at least three souls.

867
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,032
What's his level?

868
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,826
I'm hoping for two,

869
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,829
but it could be three.

870
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,584
We have to get there
before he does anything.

871
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,056
Who's So Mun?

872
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,975
Who's the best fighter here?

873
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,435
Don't ever…

874
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,854
hurt them again.

875
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,442
He said his parents passed away
in a car accident, right?

876
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,070
It might not have been an accident.

877
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,696
Then what was it?

878
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,406
An intentional accident. Murder.

879
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,783
Today's training day.

880
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,951
Just don't do anything.

881
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,080
Over here! Come quickly, Mo-tak!

882
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,874
-Mun.
-Answer me, please!

883
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,127
