3
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,695
Mom.

4
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,448
Dad.

5
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,452
Wait just a bit longer.

6
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,954
I'll catch that bastard

7
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,666
and hold a better ceremony for you
next year.

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,545
I miss you.

EPISODE 9

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,110
The report on Jinseon-ro 9-gil was
a false alarm.

12
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,154
WANTED: SUSPECT

13
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,906
The caller must've been confused.

14
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,661
Let's conduct a search before we go.

15
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,122
All right. I'll head over there.

16
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
Okay.

17
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,570
Mun, what's going on?

18
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,030
Why are you so agitated?

19
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,532
I saw Ji Cheong-sin around my house.

20
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,496
Are your teammates with you?

21
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,581
No.

22
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,542
We may never catch Ji Cheong-sin
if we lose him this time.

23
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,137
Mun.

24
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,057
Mun, you can't do this alone.

25
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,309
Lure him to a desolate place,

26
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,561
and join your team.

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,812
Mun!

28
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,564
Mun!

29
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,566
Are you listening to me?

30
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,151
Mun!

31
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,213
Mun.

32
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,215
Mun!

33
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,228
It's okay.

34
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,313
My territory is flowing here.

35
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,148
Looking for me?

36
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,438
You're running away already?

37
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,110
Or is this another one of your tricks?

38
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,195
Come into my territory.

39
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,239
I'll put an end to this.

40
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,494
Your parents tasted delightful
when I chewed on them.

41
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,795
Good, he's inside.

42
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,647
This asshole suddenly got more powerful.

43
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,671
Mun.

44
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,683
What now?

45
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,811
Say it again.

46
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,356
What did you do to my parents?
You disgusting bastard!

47
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,237
-Wi-gen!
-Wi-gen!

48
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,325
Do something.

49
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,911
Contact the Counters

50
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,581
and tell them to go find Mun.

51
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,669
Mo-tak! Where are you right now?

52
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,129
Where are you?

53
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,421
EONNI'S NOODLES

54
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,900
This is it.

55
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,820
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

56
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
Hazy like smoke.

57
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,201
It feels like a cold fog.

58
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,569
Time to go meet your parents.

59
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,494
It's coming.

60
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,580
A little more… Please…

61
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,754
You rascal.

62
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,448
Stand back.

63
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,369
Mun.

64
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,453
-Mun.
-Mun!

65
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,831
Mun.

66
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,047
Mun.

67
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,259
Ha-na.

68
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,052
Yes, you'll be okay.

69
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,262
Hang in there, Mun.

70
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,221
I'll heal you.

71
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,603
Mun.

72
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,523
He has a severed artery,
and his bones are crushed.

73
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll call for an ambulance.

74
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,986
No human being can fix him.

75
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,488
This territory isn't strong enough.

76
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,366
-Go find a stronger territory, Ha-na.
-Okay.

77
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,958
There's a huge territory at the park.

78
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,710
Mun.

79
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,880
Please hang in there, Mun.

80
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,855
What's wrong?

81
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,024
Are you in pain?

82
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,367
Can you do this?

83
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,746
It won't be easy to heal
something this bad.

84
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,665
I'll do it even if I have to risk my life.

85
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,749
Don't worry.

86
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,833
I'll heal him.

87
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,775
Mommy's hands are healing hands

88
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,821
Mun's bones are tough and strong

89
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,866
Mommy's hands are healing hands

90
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,412
Mun, you'll be fine

91
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,856
Mommy's hands are healing hands

92
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,067
Mun, you'll be fine

93
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,738
Mommy's hands are healing hands

94
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,951
Mun's bones are tough and strong

95
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,122
Mommy's hands are healing hands

96
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,251
Mun, you'll be fine

97
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,425
Mommy's hands are healing hands

98
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,054
Ms. Chu.

99
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,515
Ms. Chu!

100
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,477
Ms. Chu.

101
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,312
Ms. Chu.

102
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,106
Are you okay?

103
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,826
EONNI'S NOODLES

104
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,833
EONNI'S NOODLES

105
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,519
You must be surprised.

106
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,108
We must erase the memories

107
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,279
of anyone who finds out our identities.

108
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,075
But I won't do that to you.

109
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,120
You erase their memories?

110
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,873
Ji Cheong-sin

111
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,418
isn't someone the police can arrest.

112
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,672
You saw how he took your gun.

113
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,511
What…

114
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,638
happened back there?

115
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,599
Psychokinesis.

116
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,892
Psychokinesis?

117
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,818
Where am I supposed to start?

118
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,112
Your gun flew out of your hands.

119
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,239
That means he isn't ordinary.

120
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,033
And we aren't ordinary people either.

121
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,953
We were sent by beings up there

122
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,289
to catch evil spirits.

123
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,790
Do you know what those are?

124
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,292
Evil spirits?

125
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,419
Man, where do I begin?

126
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
Other people call us heroes.

127
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,716
But we aren't.
We just run this noodle place.

128
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,093
We need power to catch those evil spirits.

129
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,304
That's why Ms. Chu, Ha-na and I are here.

130
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,139
And Mun too. The four of us

131
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,600
are here to catch those spirits.

132
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,396
Do you see these dots?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

133
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,107
There's this place called Yung.

134
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,734
We're connected to that place.

135
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,277
Are you following?

136
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,488
That's enough.

137
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:07,990
Damn it.

138
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,951
You have to believe me.

139
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,412
What kind of nonsense was that?

140
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,358
Are you okay?

141
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,026
Yes.

142
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,614
You must've lost at least a year
of your life trying to heal him.

143
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,699
I'm fine.

144
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,161
It's more than worth it to give it up
for a young kid.

145
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,217
GRANDPA

146
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,468
It's well over 11 p.m.

147
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,387
He must be worried. What should we do?

148
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,308
GRANDPA

149
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,812
Yes, hello?

150
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,313
Is this Mun's girlfriend?

151
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,691
Girlfriend…

152
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,151
Yes, we've met before. My name is Ha-na.

153
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,404
Are you with him right now?

154
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,532
He went out to get bungeoppang
and hasn't come back,

155
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,242
and now it's 11 o'clock.

156
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,994
Bungeoppang?

157
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,705
Can you put him on the phone?

158
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,837
UNMANNED MOTEL

159
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,589
The rumors of the
candidacy announcement continues

160
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,633
for Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi of Jungjin

161
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,469
as the candidate preference
for his presidency increases.

162
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,434
Shin has been known
to make continuous efforts

163
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,186
to communicate with his supporters
and the citizens.

164
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,690
Following rumors of Shin
joining the presidential race,

165
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,776
Mayor Shin's supporters
are showing their support.

166
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,822
Though Shin hasn't formally announced
his candidacy,

167
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,324
the winds of change are blowing
in the political realm.

168
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,661
With innovation as his motto,
he brought many changes to Jungjin

169
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,164
as soon as he was elected,

170
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,374
and he was also successfully re-elected.

171
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,293
Thanks to his history,

172
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,921
many of his supporters are giving
their fervent support for his candidacy.

173
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,548
SHIN APPOINTED AS JUNGJIN'S MAYOR

174
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,967
Assholes!

175
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,429
Does he have any idea
who helped him make it that far?

176
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,224
Hey.

177
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,935
We can't be at the inauguration.

178
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,479
I mean,

179
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,315
you and I do all the dirty work
while they just sit around

180
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,941
and enjoy all the benefits!

181
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,654
Tae-sin gets a construction project
worth trillions,

182
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,283
and I'm supposed to be contented
with that random restaurant?

183
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,868
This is so damn annoying.

184
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,499
Hey.

185
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:10,255
Should we play this
at Shin Myeong-hwi's inauguration

186
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,882
and screw everyone over?

187
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,343
What is this?

188
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,308
Once Mayor Shin declares his candidacy,

189
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,645
the primary race within his party
is expected to be fierce.

190
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,481
Oh Yeong-deok of the Reformers' Party

191
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,233
has already announced his candidacy.

192
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,528
I can't get chased by the police
and end up with a hole in my head.

193
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,071
Oh's values are…

194
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,531
What's your plan?

195
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,078
My powers are nowhere near enough.

196
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,413
We had a police officer,

197
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,915
but nothing really changed.

198
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,208
I need to kill more.

199
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,751
Many more.

200
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,443
Mun, have you woken up?

201
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,279
Yes.

202
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,197
I'm up.

203
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,908
Hey, Mun. You're up?

204
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,160
Yes.

205
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,205
Try to move your hand.

206
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,876
It'll feel different from before.

207
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,919
How is it?

208
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,882
It's a bit stiff, but I'm fine.

209
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,471
Goodness, what a relief.

210
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,315
Mun.

211
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,777
You should never fight them alone.

212
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,238
Not only can you not win
against them by yourself,

213
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,073
you also can't summon them.

214
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,450
Your mind will be in Yung

215
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,286
while the spirit is being summoned,
so it's dangerous.

216
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,290
I'm sorry.

217
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,132
You must be in a hurry.

218
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,051
I'm sure you are.

219
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,637
You're in a hurry

220
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,765
to find your parents
before they dissipate.

221
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,017
Of course, you are.

222
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,982
Goodness, stop looking at me
with those sad puppy eyes.

223
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,276
Ms. Chu.

224
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,448
Your hair turned all gray because of me.

225
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,451
Don't I look great?

226
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,253
Don't get hurt.

227
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,589
I'll die of a broken heart
before I die treating you.

228
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,320
Who is it?

229
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,864
Oh, hello.

230
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,291
Goodness.

231
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,210
Did you come by to drop off bungeoppang?

232
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,004
I thought you'd be worried.

233
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,590
They got into a fight.

234
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,632
A fight?

235
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,302
Mun went out to get bungeoppang,

236
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,762
then met with his girlfriend.

237
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,473
They got into a fight
while they were hanging out,

238
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,850
and that rascal ran off somewhere.

239
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,021
He'll be home soon.

240
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,522
Have you had dinner?

241
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,482
Pardon?

242
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,319
Here. Take these.

243
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,118
Eat up, Mun-yeong.

244
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,038
That's Mun's mom.

245
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
I see.

246
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,999
Okay.

247
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,603
The jeon is still warm.

248
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,063
I warmed it up again

249
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,648
for Mun to eat when he comes back.

250
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,275
I'm even happier
now that you've had a bite.

251
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,861
You should eat too.

252
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,862
All right.

253
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,869
You can eat this
after you finish your dinner.

254
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,704
Goodness, thank you.

255
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,665
You're so pretty.

256
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,919
You're prettier.

257
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:41,962
What?

258
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,466
I heard you and Mun have been together
for two months.

259
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,010
Goodness.

260
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,223
I guess… I'm sorry.

261
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,100
Drink some water.

262
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,268
Here.

263
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,067
It has been that long, I guess.

264
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,154
Yes, it's been that long already.

265
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,865
Goodness.

266
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,415
This is it.

267
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,293
This is how you suddenly become so strong.

268
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,712
Hazy like smoke.

269
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,714
It feels like a cold fog.

270
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,633
That asshole

271
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,429
won't fall into Yung's territory
now that he knows.

272
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,516
I need to be able to bring it in myself.

273
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,063
Hey. Our territory opened up.

274
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,526
How did you just do that?

275
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,694
Do what?

276
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,156
You touched and played with our territory.

277
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,949
Am I not supposed to do that?

278
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,410
It's not that we aren't allowed to,
we can't.

279
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,371
Only I can touch the territory,

280
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,707
so I must do this.

281
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,933
Mun…

282
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,062
That's more like it!

283
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,566
I need to remember how it felt.

284
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,069
I can do this.

285
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,450
-Ung-min!
-Don't fight.

286
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,412
I told you not to hurt my friends.

287
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,667
Is it that hard?

288
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,670
Sadness.

289
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,129
Fear.

290
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,714
Anger.

291
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,230
How…

292
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,315
I felt like

293
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,235
I was going to explode with anger.

294
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,656
Why?

295
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,635
Yes.

296
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,514
Let's end this.

297
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,016
Back then…

298
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,571
I wanted…

299
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,826
I warned you that
you'd get it all back, twofold!

300
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,625
to kill that asshole.

301
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,222
What?

302
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,223
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

303
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,519
We have the results

304
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,479
of the unofficial poll held by our party.

305
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,438
Is that so?

306
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,856
PREFERRED CANDIDATE

307
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,567
"Has a reputation as an ethical
and innovative man

308
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,612
who knows the importance
of communicating with the people."

309
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,448
The four big polling organizations

310
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,368
would like to include you in the polls
starting this week.

311
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,494
What should I say?

312
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,537
Not yet.

313
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,417
If I do it after launching ICT Valley,

314
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,168
how will it affect the ratings?

315
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,754
It'll probably go up by two percent.

316
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,549
If you announce your candidacy
on the same day,

317
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,343
your lead over Oh will be
outside the margin of error,

318
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,847
and you'll climb up to first place.

319
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,476
Draw up a draft
of the candidacy announcement.

320
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,561
Yes, sir.

321
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,575
PREFERRED CANDIDATE

322
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,659
Good.

323
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,051
Yes, I got the results too.

324
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,720
When will you have Ji Cheong-sin?

325
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,513
We're doing our best.

326
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,515
I heard an officer died.

327
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,521
Keep the reporters quiet
so the news doesn't get out.

328
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,191
We can't have negative articles on Jungjin

329
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,277
until the day
of the ICT groundbreaking ceremony.

330
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,530
Will he announce his candidacy

331
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,574
on the day of the groundbreaking ceremony?

332
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,076
Yes.

333
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,120
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOH HANG-GYU

334
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,838
COMPLETE YOUR LIFE WITH URBAN DEVELOPMENT!

335
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,349
I got something.

336
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,114
Stop the car!

337
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,494
Move aside unless you want to die!

338
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,539
Hey, stop the car.

339
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,166
-What's he doing?
-Die!

340
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,509
Turn off the engine

341
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,135
and get out.

342
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,931
Damn it.

343
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,690
Go away. Step back!

344
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,775
Move aside!

345
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,490
Mo-tak, it smells like gasoline.

346
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,327
If you don't, I'll kill you.

347
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,044
I only see gasoline here too.

348
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,046
I don't think it's a waste disposal truck.

349
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,924
Who are you?

350
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,344
Why are you here?

351
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,271
You came to set this place on fire?

352
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,272
Why?

353
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,940
Then someone will finally show up.

354
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,318
If the mountain is on fire,

355
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,486
police officers
or firefighters will come by.

356
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,364
Then the world will find out

357
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,533
that this is nothing
but a mountain of waste!

358
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,330
You assholes.

359
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,457
How can you work for people like them?

360
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,001
-Wait, I…
-The waste here is

361
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,628
killing a child.

362
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,381
And my brother died because of this waste!

363
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,136
These bastards
even killed a police officer!

364
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,055
What

365
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,599
do you mean, sir?

366
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,811
How do you know that?

367
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,862
I wish I had something better to offer.
You are Detective So's son after all.

368
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,072
Thank you.

369
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,451
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

370
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,872
So-eun was born sick,

371
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,625
so her dad was very interested
in environmental problems.

372
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,378
Then he found out
about the waste mountain,

373
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,838
and he conducted
a thorough investigation on it.

374
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,050
He took this and reported it
to the city office, borough office,

375
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,344
and the Ministry of Environment.

376
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,554
No one investigated it

377
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,098
or even gave him a reply.

378
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,099
I turned it in…

379
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,225
The only one

380
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,311
who took this case on
and looked into it was

381
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,607
Detective So Gwon.

382
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,277
If your father
had ignored Jin-seung's complaint

383
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,780
like everyone else did,

384
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,740
he wouldn't have died.

385
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,204
Jin-seung was convinced
that Detective So was killed.

386
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,999
He began to get blackmailed

387
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,625
and had tails on him too.

388
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,503
He almost got run over by a truck once.

389
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,462
BRING JUNGJIN BACK

390
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,589
THE CITY OF JUNGJIN IS
KILLING MY DAUGHTER!

391
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,674
But then

392
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,802
after Detective So died,

393
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,595
Jin-seung became afraid

394
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,890
that he'd get killed
and have to leave his baby behind.

395
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,058
It's scary.

396
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,352
So he turned a blind eye

397
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,895
and went on for many years.

398
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,064
But last year…

399
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,320
So-eun was diagnosed with lymphoma.

400
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,490
It drove him insane.

401
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,658
OUR FLIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER

402
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,460
Did all these people become sick

403
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,627
due to the waste?

404
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,296
If that wasn't the cause, how could

405
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,256
so many people in one area get sick?

406
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,718
People there drink groundwater
that comes down from the mountains.

407
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,386
So did So-eun.

408
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,472
They're putting a tarp over the waste

409
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,348
to make a park.

410
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,725
An eco-friendly park.

411
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,976
Seriously…

412
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,562
Everything will be over
once it gets covered up.

413
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,065
It'll turn into a secret
and disappear from the world.

414
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,275
Can you imagine how frustrated I've been?

415
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,615
OUR FLIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER

416
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,543
Knock, knock.

417
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,587
May I come in?

418
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,969
Wow.

419
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,807
So-eun, you must like BTS.

420
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:02,975
I love them too.

421
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,270
Once you get better,
let's go to their concert.

422
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,397
Really?

423
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:09,941
Yes.

424
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,442
But

425
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,655
who are you?

426
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,616
Right.

427
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,452
Your dad

428
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,705
and my dad were friends.

429
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,207
Friends?

430
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,251
Yes.

431
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,503
Dad…

432
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,589
I miss him.

433
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,051
Me too.

434
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:42,140
So you need to stay strong
and get better soon, okay?

435
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,225
Promise me.

436
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,439
Good girl.

437
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,780
Mo-tak.

438
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,784
Can't Ms. Chu help So-eun?

439
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,328
She can't treat illnesses or disabilities.

440
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,997
But she fixed me.

441
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,209
You're a Counter, kid.

442
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,011
Hello?

443
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,388
-Are you driving?
-Yes.

444
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,225
The blood sample of the Kim Yeong-nim
murder suspect is gone.

445
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,312
What? How did that happen?

446
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,730
How is that possible?

447
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,023
It's the NFS!

448
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,066
Someone came by as soon as I turned it in,

449
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,693
canceled the request, and took it.

450
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,028
Who did?

451
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,404
They said it was Mr. Pyo.

452
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,489
I'm sure Chief Choi has it now.

453
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,201
EONNI'S NOODLES

454
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,126
Damn it, those assholes!

455
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,754
Man, come on.

456
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,548
Don't destroy the place, Mo-tak.

457
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,176
I can't believe this.

458
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,638
People disappearing one after another,

459
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,306
and kids getting sick and dying.

460
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,059
Then they cover it up
by killing another person.

461
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,270
Shin Myeong-hwi and those jerks.

462
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,357
Yet people don't know that these things
are happening in Jungjin.

463
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,609
We'll expose it.

464
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,819
How?

465
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,697
It can't be covered up.

466
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,910
The police are on their side.

467
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,878
Let's let everyone know, Mun.

468
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,338
Let's stir them up.

469
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:43,552
Let's pull down their underpants
in front of everyone.

470
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,264
What? Underpants?

471
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,766
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

472
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
All done.

473
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,695
SPECIAL TALK: SHIN MYEONG-HWI

474
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,576
SPECIAL TALK: SHIN MYEONG-HWI

475
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,579
My hair looks perfect for this role.

476
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,414
LEE JIN-OK

477
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,540
This photo is too old.

478
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,959
Who the heck is Jin-ok?

479
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,589
I've kept that photo with me
for seven long years.

480
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,924
Give me a new one, then.

481
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,802
This isn't the time to be flirting.

482
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,139
I knew something was up
between you and Ms. Chu, Chairman Choi.

483
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,266
You caught on.

484
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,603
Hey, Mun. So apparently, I asked you out.

485
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,942
Wait. How did you know?

486
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,528
So I did. Your grandfather told me.

487
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,698
Oh, because he kept asking me
all these questions about you,

488
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,076
I had to explain…
Oh, thanks for the bungeoppang.

489
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,202
Exactly. So why--

490
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,912
Wait, what's the bungeoppang about?

491
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,456
Why did I ask you out first in your story?

492
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,501
Then if I said I asked you out first,
is that all right?

493
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,627
What a load of nonsense.

494
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,630
Remember to use honorifics.

495
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,548
Yes, ma'am.

496
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,802
Ms. Jang.

497
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,930
I got Mayor Shin some coffee.

498
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,473
Take this.

499
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,516
Sure.

500
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:59,563
Anyway, will he announce his candidacy
on TV today?

501
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,524
Will he? Really?

502
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,025
Yes.

503
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,114
Number one, Noh Chang-gyu.

504
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,284
Man, it's… My gosh!

505
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,828
Who are you?

506
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,082
Ga Mo…

507
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,966
Hey, we might grow on each other
at this rate.

508
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,677
Aren't we close enough

509
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,804
to call each other besties?

510
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,352
I was going to do that for him.

511
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,645
My goodness.

512
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,815
-Hey.
-Aren't you from the noodle place?

513
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,571
-No, it's not her.
-She's the owner there.

514
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,656
-Why would she be here?
-It is her.

515
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,159
-Goodness!
-It is her!

516
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,077
-Why are you here?
-My goodness.

517
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,037
What brings all of you here?

518
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,622
For Shin Myeong-hwi?

519
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,292
You are handsome, Shin Myeong-hwi!

520
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,711
We love you, Shin Myeong-hwi!

521
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,754
-It's nice to see you here.
-It's so nice.

522
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,840
DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY

523
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,383
TODAY, I'D LIKE TO DECLARE…

524
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,135
Once you're done talking about ICT,

525
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,887
the anchor will change the topic

526
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,514
to your presidential candidacy.

527
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,309
We already wrote out the script.

528
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,861
MASTER CONTROL ROOM

529
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,904
Excuse me.

530
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,863
Come in.

531
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,289
MASTER CONTROL ROOM

532
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,502
Should I have said I work two jobs?

533
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,337
Sorry.

534
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,964
When you come by next time,
I'll give you twice as much.

535
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,759
Honey, Shin Myeong-hwi isn't a good guy.

536
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:56,138
One, two, three.

537
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:00,434
Next, it's time for our special talk.

538
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,312
I'm here today with the mayor of Jungjin,
Mr. Shin Myeong-hwi.

539
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,730
Mr. Mayor, hello.

540
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,981
Yes, I'm glad to be here.

541
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,149
You must be quite busy.

542
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,278
I've been planning
ICT's phase-3 development,

543
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,280
so I've been a little busy lately.

544
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,823
How's your health?

545
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,451
-I try to work out whenever I can.
-Mr. Chairman.

546
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,828
After ICT's first two phases,

547
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,288
-Why are you here?
-your name

548
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,207
-became known in the nation.
-I had

549
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,583
an interview regarding Ji.

550
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,543
I didn't expect

551
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,503
-so much support from everyone.
-I came by

552
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,213
-to say hello.
-I'm grateful

553
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,507
-for all the love and support you showed.
-Okay.

554
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,343
The groundbreaking ceremony

555
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,595
for the third ICT Valley
will be held soon.

556
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,972
It turned into a big deal

557
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,182
even before the construction work began.

558
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,186
I tried to think of a mayor
who developed a city

559
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,272
as successfully as you did,

560
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,940
but you're the first one to do it.

561
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,317
Goodness, I'm flattered.

562
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,319
But I didn't do this all by myself.

563
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,696
And you're modest too.

564
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,658
Mayor Shin, I'd like to ask you a question

565
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,494
that many people
are waiting to hear the answer to.

566
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,997
It's about the rumor
of you running for president.

567
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,873
Will you give us an answer today?

568
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:11,714
I'm ready.

569
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,800
Don't even dream of it.

570
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,431
We'll continue to discuss that topic
after the eco-friendly park,

571
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,267
the core of ICT's phase-3 development.

572
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,061
Let's watch a video
on the eco-friendly park.

573
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,988
THIS IS THE SITE
OF THE SO-CALLED ECO-FRIENDLY PARK

574
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,741
While maintaining the natural ecology
of the area,

575
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,745
culture, recreation, health,
and sports facilities

576
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,247
will be constructed
at the eco-friendly park.

577
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:49,084
You should come to Jungjin,
the city that's beloved

578
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,046
by its people. Get what I'm saying?

579
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,134
Go beyond Jungjin
and come to the Blue House.

580
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,886
Get what I'm saying?

581
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,472
MURDERER 2

582
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,891
What's that?

583
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,476
MURDERER 3

584
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,394
The man who is beloved by the people.

585
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,438
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

586
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,399
The man who will take responsibility
for your health and safety.

587
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,652
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

588
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,695
-Turn it off.
-The man beloved by...

589
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,489
No, there must be a misunderstanding.

590
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,240
Get what I'm saying?

591
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,078
-Get what I'm saying?
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

592
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,287
Turn it off!

593
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,543
Look over there!

594
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,005
Hello, I enjoy watching you on TV.

595
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,300
One, two. Microphone test. One, two.

596
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,720
Everyone, I present to you this murderer

597
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,432
who dumped waste illegally
at the grounds of the eco-friendly park!

598
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,563
Ha-na, now.

599
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,584
What's this smell?

600
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,257
-Cut it out!
-Don't come near me!

601
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,633
Don't come near me!

602
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,013
-Don't come any closer!
-Get him!

603
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,104
Mr. Mayor, this way. Come this way.

604
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,730
Hold on to my hand.

605
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,449
Oh no, Mr. Mayor.

606
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,242
Goodness, this is gross.

607
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,535
-So gross.
-Who are you?

608
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,956
You deserve to be behind bars,
you piece of human trash.

609
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,459
Mun, let's go.

610
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,424
-Hurry up, you punk!
-But there's one more!

611
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,094
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

612
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,888
-Get them!
-Go get them.

613
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,390
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

614
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,225
-Damn it.
-Whoa.

615
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,227
-What's he doing?
-No, stop.

616
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,324
No, stop.

617
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,409
-Go get him.
-Get him.

618
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,916
Mo-tak, we're leaving.

619
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:39,922
Damn it!

620
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:51,517
How dare they do this
on the day of my announcement!

621
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,310
EMERGENCY STAIRS

622
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,236
-Wait, stop!
-No!

623
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,654
-Hey, kid!
-Open this!

624
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,821
-Damn it.
-Hey!

625
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,906
Oh, man.

626
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,675
Gentlemen, take your wastewater back.

627
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,010
Get a taste of your own wastewater!

628
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:30,013
Stop it, you bastards!

629
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,454
Did that taste good, you assholes?

630
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,720
-Please!
-Open the door, please!

631
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,473
-Mr. Chairman!
-Open this!

632
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,808
We're done here.

633
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,943
Reporters!

634
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,820
There's a huge scoop out there!

635
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,947
The murderers of Jungjin are out there!

636
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,159
-Run.
-Hurry up.

637
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,912
You're Chairman Cho Tae-sin, right?

638
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,289
Do you admit everything?

639
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,582
-Do you?
-Whatever.

640
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,666
-Say something.
-Stop.

641
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,627
-Cameras off.
-How do you feel?

642
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,628
Say something.

643
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,504
Turn off the damn cameras!

644
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,720
It's me.
Postpone the groundbreaking ceremony.

645
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,930
And keep the media from reporting on this.

646
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,267
Make sure you put together a statement
to refute what they said!

647
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,105
DECLARATION OF CANDIDACY

648
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,240
Are you hurt?

649
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,742
Stop talking to me, idiot.

650
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,286
What the…

651
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,248
Who are you?

652
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,917
You…

653
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,679
Mo-tak.

654
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,055
Su-ryong.

655
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,432
Su-ryong.

656
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,062
I forgot everything else.

657
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,273
But I still remember

658
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,944
how much respect I had for you.

659
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,824
Did you do this?

660
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,119
Come and catch me if you can.

661
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,457
When you do, I'll blow this up
into an even bigger deal.

662
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,257
After I've caught all those jerks,

663
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,009
I'll come for you.

664
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,110
They put innocent people to sleep,

665
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,611
erased their memories,

666
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,365
and used violence in an occasion

667
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,200
unrelated to evil spirits.

668
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,585
What's going on?

669
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,677
During today's live broadcast,

670
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:59,306
Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi's face was
splashed with wastewater.

671
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,557
SHIN HUMILIATED

672
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,935
As you have heard, the site that was
designated for the eco-friendly park

673
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,188
as a part of ICT's phase-3 development

674
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,273
was exposed as an illegal dumping ground

675
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:10,108
where construction waste was dumped

676
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,193
for decades,

677
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,861
and it caused a huge controversy.

678
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,406
You're right. To sum it up,

679
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,827
this will likely cause a problem
for Mayor Shin's presidential candidacy.

680
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,245
That's definitely possible.

681
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,332
It'll cause a problem
for his presidential candidacy.

682
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,125
An immense problem.

683
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,590
All right!

684
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,936
-One!
-Two.

685
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,062
Three.

686
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,438
Four!

687
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,618
-Here are your noodles.
-What's going on?

688
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,870
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

689
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,138
Mo-tak.

690
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,516
I forgot everything else.

691
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,269
But I still remember

692
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,814
how much respect I had for you.

693
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,191
Come and catch me if you can.

694
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,862
When you do, I'll blow this up
into an even bigger deal.

695
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,204
You took the blood sample, didn't you?

696
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,290
That belonged to a suspect.

697
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,916
If you destroyed that,

698
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,710
it means you know

699
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,337
who killed Kim Yeong-nim.

700
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,715
You knew, didn't you?

701
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,302
That Mo-tak came back.

702
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,346
That's why you were so bold.

703
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,182
Isn't that so?

704
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,642
It was Shin Myeong-hwi.

705
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:24,576
I used to have only one mugunghwa mark
on my badge,

706
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,578
but now I have three more.

707
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,122
I'm just waiting to turn that
into a bigger badge.

708
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,334
I'm about to go to Seoul!

709
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,171
Chief Choi.

710
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,006
I won't give up.

711
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,551
And Mo-tak will see this to the end.

712
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,898
Do whatever you can.

713
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,868
The city council is pressuring us

714
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,996
to reconsider the construction
of the eco-friendly park.

715
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,541
They decided to leave out
all parties related to Taesin

716
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,794
from the environmental research

717
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,879
and select their own.

718
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,547
They'll get another company

719
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,133
to dig up the reservoir?

720
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,135
They plan on investigating thoroughly.

721
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,262
They're set on it.

722
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,139
Damn it!

723
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,016
I put half of them on the council.

724
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
Did they all go crazy?

725
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,771
Give me the list of council members.

726
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,489
Who has the biggest say?

727
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,535
Councilman Ham In-pyo is the leader.

728
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,412
Ham In-pyo.

729
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,621
You may leave.

730
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,332
Yes, sir.

731
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,465
Go do more favors for them

732
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,676
or attack their weakest points.

733
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,636
-Yes, sir.
-What if

734
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,805
they end up finding Kim Yeong-nim's body?

735
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,101
You don't have to worry about that.

736
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,189
These rats are the problem.

737
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,527
On the day that Mr. Mayor
was declaring his candidacy?

738
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,654
Why show up suddenly

739
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,073
after playing dead all this time?

740
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,326
Was he waiting for the right time
to get revenge?

741
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,662
It doesn't look like he'll give up easily.

742
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,456
Ga Mo-tak is determined

743
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,084
to find Kim Yeong-nim's corpse
in the reservoir no matter what.

744
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,382
Kill him.

745
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,515
That looks so good.

746
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,267
-Cut it into big pieces.
-Stop that.

747
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,102
-Cut it into four pieces.
-Four it is.

748
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,982
-Wow, come on.
-Hey.

749
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,069
You can't do this without me.

750
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,653
Grab a seat.

751
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,988
How did you know?

752
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,616
We kept it a secret on purpose.

753
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,495
I could smell the meat
all the way over there.

754
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,871
He has a good nose.

755
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,124
What happened to Mr. Kwon's daughter?

756
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,170
Well, she's doing well at the hospital.

757
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,672
Let's hope she stays strong.

758
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,674
She'll live through this.

759
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,719
All right.

760
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,687
-It's hot.
-Eat up, everyone.

761
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,147
-Okay.
-Goodness.

762
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,900
Ms. Chu, have a lettuce wrap.

763
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,361
Goodness, thanks.

764
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,280
Okay, then.

765
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,240
I want some garlic.

766
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,034
Garlic. Okay.

767
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,164
-Mun, it's for you.
-Okay.

768
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,210
Feed yourself. You have hands.

769
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,753
Right.

770
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,755
My gosh.

771
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,176
Ha-na.

772
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,929
You're going to eat that in one bite?

773
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,264
Can you really do that?

774
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,100
-Whoa.
-Wow.

775
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,270
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

776
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,275
I knew it.

777
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,901
You have a huge mouth.

778
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:32,115
Mun.

779
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,117
Yes?

780
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,828
I need all the Counters up here.

781
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,793
All of us?

782
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,838
Okay.

783
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,425
Let's not get dragged around.

784
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,594
Don't be scared, everyone.

785
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,515
Come back before the meat burns.

786
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,100
Let's go, everyone.

787
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,351
-In a little bit.
-Let's go.

788
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,937
Wait a second.

789
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,359
Damn it. I barely had a chance to eat.

790
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,149
JUNGJIN CITY HALL

791
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,164
You can't come in here.

792
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,794
Hey, who are you?

793
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,929
What's going on outside?

794
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,851
Anyone outside?

795
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,312
You can't let in all sorts of riffraff!

796
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,732
Who are you?

797
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,572
What the hell do you want?

798
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,080
Ji Cheong-sin?

799
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,380
Whoa, this is no joke.

800
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,258
She must be the famous inspector.

801
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,728
Grab him!

802
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,945
Goodness, this is gross.

803
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,572
-So gross.
-Who are you?

804
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,369
You are not allowed to use your powers

805
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:26,372
for anything unrelated to evil spirits.

806
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,584
Yung has already warned you prior to this

807
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,502
for breaking the rules as a Counter,

808
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,756
but I received a report that says
your behavior wasn't corrected.

809
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:35,965
Is this true?

810
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,051
It's true.

811
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:43,181
I'm asking the Counters.

812
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,641
It's true.

813
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,477
You are aware

814
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:51,356
that you get dismissed
after five warnings, aren't you?

815
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,149
Yes.

816
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,235
Chu Mae-ok.

817
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,539
Should I have said I work two jobs?

818
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,667
Sorry.

819
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,876
Mr. Ga Mo-tak.

820
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,846
Chu Mae-ok, two warnings.

821
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,814
Ga Mo-tak.

822
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,504
We must erase the memories

823
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,798
of anyone who finds out our identities.

824
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,550
But I won't do that to you.

825
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,764
Ga Mo-tak, four warnings.

826
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,725
Four?

827
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,477
Objection.

828
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,312
What? Why?

829
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,816
He disclosed their identities as Counters

830
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,194
in order to receive help
to summon a level-three evil spirit.

831
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,531
Please take that into consideration.

832
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,453
Was that so? I mean, yes.

833
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,912
That was it. That's why.

834
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,374
I'll discuss that
with the other inspectors.

835
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,961
I'm so relieved.

836
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:38,880
Do Ha-na.

837
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,555
Damn you.

838
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,112
I have to tell my daughter something.

839
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,822
Mom?

840
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,326
Do Ha-na, four warnings.

841
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,453
-Do you object?
-I did that--

842
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,038
I don't.

843
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,255
-So Mun.
-Yes.

844
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,305
You asshole!

845
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,857
Why?

846
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,158
So Mun, three warnings.

847
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:54,789
Do Ha-na, you must remember
that you'll be dismissed

848
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:57,250
if you break the rules as a Counter
one more time

849
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,668
as you carry on your duties.

850
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,546
You'll be stripped of your rights
as a Counter

851
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,799
and also lose your life.

852
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:09,971
We're aware.

853
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:14,392
-Now, we'll wrap up the hearing--
-Before we wrap up,

854
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:18,771
I'd like to say something.

855
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,991
Regardless of the number of warnings,

856
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:34,370
I believe that Counter 1543 So Mun

857
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,207
should be dismissed.

858
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,292
I must save my parents
with my own two hands.

859
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,795
I cannot quit this job.

860
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,632
That's enough.

861
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,050
At this rate, I'll lose you

862
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,010
and even Ha-na before we catch them.

863
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,511
I, Shin Myeong-hwi,

864
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,681
have decided to run for president.

865
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,852
He must be gathering evil spirits.

866
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,646
-Who are you?
-I'm your savior.

867
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,147
Wait, hold on.

868
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,112
