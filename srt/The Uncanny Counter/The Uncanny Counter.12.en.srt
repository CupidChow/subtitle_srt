1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,207
Stay with me.

4
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,502
Jeong-yeong, stay with me.

5
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:09,963
Help!

6
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,216
We need help over here!

7
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,051
Jeong-yeong.

8
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,887
Are you Detective Kim Jeong-yeong?

9
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,223
I thought you'd be a guy.

10
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,977
You remember Su-ryong?

11
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,146
I remember things that are very old…

12
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,314
But why?

13
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,941
Do you…

14
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,985
remember everything?

15
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,528
Yes.

16
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,073
Jeong-yeong.

17
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,033
We have

18
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,286
a lot

19
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,288
to catch up on.

20
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:44,789
We do.

21
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,543
Jeong-yeong, please…

22
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,461
Jeong-yeong.

23
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,466
-Did she get shot?
-She's still alive. She's alive.

24
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,219
Jeong-yeong! Can you hear me?

25
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,721
Can you hear me?

26
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,930
OPERATING ROOM

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,891
Can you hear me?

28
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,935
I'll be waiting here.

29
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,354
I'll be waiting right here.

30
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,273
I'll be waiting…

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,942
DO NOT ENTER

32
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,093
What's up? I have an appointment.

33
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,470
Where are you going?

34
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,513
Why can't you tell me what's going on?

35
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,516
Something dangerous, right?

36
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,145
I need to get a haircut
before I meet your parents tomorrow.

37
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,688
That's not important now.

38
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
It is. Nothing's more important than that.

39
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,150
Mo-tak.

40
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,862
Whoever dares to mess with me

41
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,947
will learn a lesson.

42
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,159
So don't worry.

43
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,579
It'll rain later. Get your umbrella.

44
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,164
Hey.

45
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,880
Then did you… Hey, wait!

46
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,301
Have you…

47
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,678
been waiting for me

48
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,097
for the past seven years?

49
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,685
No. Not anymore.

50
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,523
I finally…

51
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,402
remember everything,

52
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,115
so don't do this to me.

53
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,659
Charge to 150 joules.

54
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,286
-Got it, 150 joules.
-Clear.

55
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,413
Shock!

56
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,000
Jeong-yeong.

57
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,752
Jeong-yeong!

58
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,845
DO NOT ENTER

59
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,099
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

60
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:00,651
DO NOT ENTER

61
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,661
DO NOT ENTER

62
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,217
Jeong-yeong!

63
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,803
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

64
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,846
Jeong-yeong…

65
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,652
EPISODE 12

66
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,991
-Hello.
-Oh, you're here.

67
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,206
I'm coming from her funeral.

68
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,458
Is the burial tomorrow?

69
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,211
Yes, I'm sure you guys

70
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,922
all want to go to the funeral

71
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,423
but say your goodbyes later.

72
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,430
There's no "later."

73
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,103
Today's the last day I can do it.

74
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,229
You'll go there?

75
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,357
Mo-tak, please calm down
and think rationally.

76
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,734
You're aware
they all think you guys are dead.

77
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,403
You shouldn't be seen now.

78
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,739
But I need to say a proper goodbye.

79
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,617
We never really had a chance to talk.

80
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,787
Mo-tak.

81
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,587
I'll go with him.

82
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,619
I'm so sorry for your loss.

83
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,174
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

84
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,621
I'm sure they found his traces
at the scene of Kwon Jin-seung's death.

85
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,665
Why can't you connect it to Jeon's case?

86
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,875
They're connected in a way.

87
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,296
The chief has been doing his best
to cover up those cases.

88
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,344
She committed suicide.

89
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,805
-Suicide?
-Hey, shush.

90
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,809
Jeong-yeong submitted the permit herself
at 10 a.m.

91
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,769
and picked up a gun with live rounds.

92
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,606
We've confirmed that the serial number
matches the one she got.

93
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,863
What happened?

94
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,740
Any idea why she took her own life?

95
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,368
She wasn't cut out
for working with others.

96
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,621
And she seemed emotionally unstable.

97
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,874
Mo-tak, don't.

98
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,834
Mun.

99
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,713
Let go.

100
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,132
Those bastards are saying
she took her own life.

101
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,308
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

102
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,184
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

103
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,982
JUNGJIN FUNERAL HOME

104
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,009
No!

105
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,386
No…

106
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,347
Gosh…

107
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,355
How did you

108
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,942
cope with it?

109
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,486
You lost

110
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,614
your parents at the age of 11.

111
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,367
It couldn't have been easy.

112
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,246
With your injury…

113
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,833
And you also suffered from aphasia.

114
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,266
Mo-tak.

115
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,854
Between you and my dad,

116
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,730
who was older?

117
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,695
Your dad was

118
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,698
a year younger than me.

119
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,537
But he never used honorifics toward me.

120
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,376
When we meet my dad in heaven,

121
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,005
you should teach him a big lesson.

122
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,812
It's okay.

123
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,649
One's enough. No more.

124
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,777
Mo-tak.

125
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,365
You see, when you're a Counter,

126
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
the gap

127
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,203
between life and death

128
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,541
doesn't seem so huge,
and that's comforting.

129
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,377
That's how I feel, at least.

130
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,714
Although I'm not sure
if this is any consolation to you.

131
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,720
You little rascal.

132
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,557
Thanks.

133
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,769
Sure.

134
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,981
-Mun.
-Yes?

135
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,069
About Jeong-yeong…

136
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,614
The police shot her.

137
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,698
What?

138
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
I know

139
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,413
because I saw

140
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,875
Jeong-yeong's

141
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
last memory.

142
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,089
Jeong-yeong! Can you hear me?

143
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,137
That watch.

144
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,515
A watch? What about it?

145
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,559
It was the watch

146
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,103
that is only given to officers

147
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,023
who have been with the force for 20 years.

148
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,280
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

149
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,325
Hey, we're closing this case.

150
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,288
And Han-ul is joining our team,
so create a new position for him.

151
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,875
Han-ul. Hey, buddy.

152
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,752
Bring all the cases
that Jeong-yeong was working on.

153
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,006
Everything including those
on Noh Hang-gyu and Noh Chang-gyu.

154
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923
Yes, sir.

155
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,225
KIM JEONG-YEONG

156
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,520
But let's pretend
you never saw these pictures.

157
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,980
What's your plan?

158
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,775
You just gave me the fake names
registered with the burner phones.

159
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,319
That's all you did. Got it?

160
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,821
Answer me.

161
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,197
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,883
Team 3, this is Kang Han-ul.

163
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,760
Hello, this is Ga Mo-tak.

164
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,857
I had the phone company
look up the number.

165
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,361
They said they have
no record of that number.

166
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:48,906
Jeong-yeong's case…

167
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,825
Aren't they treating it as suicide?

168
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,411
Yes.

169
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,330
Any CCTV footage?

170
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,541
All the cameras in the vicinity

171
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,670
were either broken or just off her route.

172
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,880
And no dashcam footage, obviously.

173
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,050
Well…

174
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,886
I know she didn't take her own life.

175
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,973
She supposedly picked up the gun
at 10 a.m. on the 8th,

176
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,100
but she was with me then.

177
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,477
I don't know who did it,

178
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,313
but someone at the precinct
picked it up under her name

179
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,899
and gave it to Ji Cheong-sin.

180
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,985
Ji Cheong-sin?

181
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,366
She said Ji Cheong-sin is still alive.

182
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,827
She confirmed the burnt corpse wasn't his.

183
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,250
Even so,

184
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,837
I don't think Ji Cheong-sin was the one
who shot her.

185
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,338
What?

186
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,304
How many officers

187
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,561
at Jungjin Police Station have been
with the force for over 20 years?

188
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,271
I'm not sure.

189
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,482
I only joined them under probation
two months ago.

190
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,567
Can you…

191
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,778
find out?

192
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,989
Do you think it was someone in the force?

193
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm scared.

194
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,085
I'll find out.

195
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,755
Be careful.

196
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,049
And don't trust anyone.

197
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,101
Did they kill Jeong-yeong because of this?

198
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:47,274
How far along was she
in the investigation?

199
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,444
She froze Noh Hang-gyu's
borrowed-name account.

200
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,570
So this is about money?

201
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,115
That's when the chief started
openly putting pressure on the case.

202
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,913
Can I see the documents regarding this?

203
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,337
They were funding the campaign illegally.

204
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,090
Clearly, the money went
to Shin Myeong-hwi.

205
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,217
SHIN MYEONG-HWI

206
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,511
-Five billion won?
-My goodness.

207
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,848
So they killed her just because
she found out about the illicit funds?

208
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,434
Just like they killed Mun's father
seven years ago?

209
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,478
But this time, it's different.

210
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:28,398
My dad's case was seven years ago,
whereas this has only just begun.

211
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,234
We can use this to take them down.

212
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,278
Not if we use the same method.

213
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:39,159
The memories won't be considered evidence,
and they'll destroy all solid evidence.

214
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,579
They made people believe that
the burnt corpse is Ji Cheong-sin's,

215
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,666
and no one even remembers
that mountain of garbage anymore.

216
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,337
They keep killing officers on the case.

217
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,548
Then what should we do
with these bastards?

218
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,887
Let's do things their way.

219
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,056
"Their way"?

220
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,437
They think
Ji Cheong-sin burned us to death.

221
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,523
We'll move quietly
as if we're actually dead.

222
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,066
These five billion won…

223
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,110
Let's steal it.

224
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,195
-That money?
-We'll steal it?

225
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,864
Are you kidding me?

226
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,532
Actually, she has a point.

227
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,535
Even if it gets stolen,
they can't report it to the police.

228
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,745
They can't prove it's their money.

229
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,331
So we'll rob them of their campaign funds?

230
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,499
Okay.

231
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,459
We'll hang them out to dry.

232
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,795
Who will they reach out to
when the money runs dry?

233
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,589
Another financial backer.

234
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,549
They'll call me their savior.

235
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,511
What will we do with that money though?

236
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,639
Since it came from the people's pockets,

237
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,184
-we'll return it to them.
-Bingo.

238
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,228
Then let's do it. We have to do this.

239
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,229
Before that…

240
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,985
We must break them up first.

241
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,865
Mayor Shin, Cho Tae-sin, Choi Su-ryong.
We have to break them up.

242
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,242
Only then will we have a chance.

243
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,204
-Right.
-When the money disappears into thin air,

244
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,289
they'll be suspicious of one other.

245
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,457
Okay.

246
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,501
I'll try to pull some strings.

247
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,462
Guys, hold on.

248
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,841
Our job is to capture evil spirits,
not go after corruption.

249
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,760
Those in Yung won't be okay with this.

250
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,262
Will you let a murderer become president?

251
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,681
Gosh, no. We can't let that happen.

252
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,976
They love money,
so we'll use money to take them down.

253
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,062
I'm going to Yung.

254
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,188
I'll go with you.

255
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,417
How did it go?

256
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,087
We had a long meeting about it.

257
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,340
They joined hands with an evil spirit.

258
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,342
They hired an evil spirit as their hitman.

259
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,510
Yes, I know.

260
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,178
So…

261
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,515
we've decided to cooperate
with your decision.

262
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,892
Mo-tak.

263
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:14,147
But this really isn't just about
getting your revenge, is it?

264
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,736
Thanks for your help.

265
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,201
Oh, he's back.

266
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,330
Mo-tak, how did it go?
Do we have their permission?

267
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,293
In regard to taking down those assholes,
they won't intervene at all.

268
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,669
Yes!

269
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,296
-Nice.
-Let's do this!

270
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,881
We'll have to do this
as quietly as possible,

271
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,883
so let's close the restaurant for a while.

272
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,510
Okay, let's do that.

273
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,473
We'll capture Ji Cheong-sin
and help Mun's parents ascend.

274
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,934
We can reopen after that.

275
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,282
EONNI'S NOODLES

276
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,682
EONNI'S NOODLES

277
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,684
ONLY OPEN WHILE SUPPLIES LAST

278
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,440
FOR LEASE INQUIRE

279
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,860
Oh, five cell phones?

280
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,488
Got it. No problem, Boss.

281
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,282
They're getting five burner phones.

282
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,492
Five?

283
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,577
Hang-gyu and Chang-gyu
must be getting out.

284
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,038
Just a second.

285
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,625
I did it. All done.

286
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,086
-Hey, woman.
-Mimi!

287
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,962
-What the…
-Mimi!

288
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,548
-Where did this dog go? Mimi!
-What's with this woman?

289
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,509
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Mimi!

290
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,968
My gosh.

291
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,266
Confirmed.

292
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,480
CELLULAR HUB

293
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,003
Shin Myeong-hwi.

294
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,058
I'm here.

295
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,852
Oh, boy.

296
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,399
Jeez, that girl.
I'm going to totally whack her.

297
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,568
Haven't you heard the news?
She killed herself.

298
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
-Who?
-Right, Boss?

299
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,533
Bam!

300
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:12,951
For real?

301
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,746
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,881
What's this?

303
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,969
SHIN MYEONG-HWI, CHO TAE-SIN,
NOH HANG-GYU, NOH CHANG-GYU

304
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,313
Hey. Let's go to the sauna first.

305
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,856
Get your act together.

306
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,317
We have to cover up the exposed account.

307
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,569
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

308
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,826
SHIN MYEONG-HWI, CHO TAE-SIN,
NOH HANG-GYU, NOH CHANG-GYU, CHOI SU-RYONG

309
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,041
It must've been stressful for you.

310
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,210
I'm sorry for causing you concern, sir.

311
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,669
It was stressful indeed.

312
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,797
What happened to Ga Mo-tak?

313
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,799
He's dead. I set him on fire.

314
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,051
Fire?

315
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,802
Are you sure he's dead?

316
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:16,681
That punk, Ji Cheong-sin,
knows how to put on a show.

317
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,558
All right.

318
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,543
-Give us a moment.
-Yes, sir.

319
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,806
What are you doing in my office?

320
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,645
Meeting the party leader today?

321
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,189
Are you busy these days?

322
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,108
Of course, the election's coming up.

323
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,569
Hang-gyu's been released.

324
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,822
The election will be much easier now.

325
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,242
My secretary is putting
the camp together for me,

326
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,370
so you and Mr. Noh
don't need to worry about it.

327
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,251
What? So you want us out?

328
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,669
It's grown in scale.

329
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,047
Then we'll make the necessary arrangements
to befit the scale.

330
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,303
I'm heading out now.

331
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,180
Tidy up the table and help me pick a tie.

332
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,140
Yes, sir.

333
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,687
Give us a moment, please.

334
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,272
I haven't finished my coffee.

335
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,878
We'll call you at this number from now on.

336
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,380
I've already put together a team
to assist you.

337
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,176
We can take you anywhere in the country,
so just relax and enjoy the ride.

338
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,190
This cookie is very good.

339
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,575
Hey, lady!

340
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,787
They wouldn't die that easily.

341
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,790
They died in a fire. You call that easy?

342
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,042
Jeez.

343
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,878
Let's take it easy, okay?

344
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,422
Gosh, I got out of the lockup
less than an hour ago.

345
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,840
Let's go to the sauna.

346
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,303
Hop in.

347
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,310
EONNI'S NOODLES

348
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,438
FOR LEASE INQUIRE

349
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,115
Sir.

350
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,456
-This is Mr. Choi Jang-mul.
-Yes, I know.

351
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,417
-I'm a fan of yours.
-My gosh.

352
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,505
I've seen you at events,
but this is our first meal together.

353
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,924
Right.

354
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,806
It was years ago,

355
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,768
but I went to jail once

356
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,229
for breach of duty and embezzlement.

357
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,314
-You?
-Yes!

358
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,443
I had a heart attack
while I was behind bars.

359
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,111
I nearly died.

360
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,529
My gosh.

361
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,992
Having gone through that,
I decided to change my ways.

362
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,871
This is a rather embarrassing thing
to say as a businessman,

363
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:12,250
but I wanted to sell my products
to help those in need.

364
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,169
"Spread the wealth."

365
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,713
Since I've been running my business
with that motto,

366
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,799
people remember nothing about me
going to jail.

367
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,927
It's definitely helped me clean up
my disgraceful past.

368
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,722
My goodness, don't be so modest.

369
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:30,351
You've been giving back to the community
for 20 years. That's who you are.

370
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,811
Gosh, I'm flattered.

371
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,938
I'll pour you one.

372
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,274
-Oh, thank you.
-My pleasure.

373
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:47,952
TAESIN GROUP

374
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:59,380
I have a bad feeling about this, Hang-gyu.

375
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,340
What's wrong?

376
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,802
The construction for the reservoir
is coming along nicely.

377
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,097
I'm talking about Shin Myeong-hwi.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

378
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,434
Now that he's announced
he's running for president,

379
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,437
all the hotshots are running to him
offering help.

380
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,816
Is this just a little hiccup
in our relationship

381
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,734
or a sign that a breakup is imminent?

382
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,822
I whacked all those who could've
caused trouble for him. This prick…

383
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,992
I think he'll ditch us and fly away.

384
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,870
Mayor Shin can't mess with us.

385
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,288
You know that.

386
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,209
No, that's not true.

387
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,088
But…

388
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,716
I think we need insurance.

389
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,344
"Insurance"?

390
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,640
Oh, my.

391
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,980
My gosh, how time flies.

392
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,523
Do you have to go?

393
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:03,319
Yes, we shouldn't stay out late
given the current situation.

394
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,074
And we've touched upon
all the important things anyway.

395
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:10,034
I'll get going, then.

396
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,416
Then get home safely,
my campaign club leader.

397
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,670
My gosh, the campaign club leader for
presidential candidate Shin Myeong-hwi.

398
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,256
Just hearing that title
puts a smile on my face.

399
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,842
After you.

400
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,222
Mayor Shin. Five billion won, okay?

401
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,641
If you can get five billion ready,

402
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,518
then I'll contribute the same amount.

403
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,478
If you say you only have ten million,

404
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,689
then I guess that will be it.

405
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,901
-Yes, well understood.
-All right, then.

406
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,698
Get home safely.

407
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,671
CHO TAE-SIN

408
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,843
Hey.

409
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,638
Get some bullets ready, Mr. Cho.

410
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,557
Five billion won. In cash.

411
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,477
Five billion? The entire amount in cash?

412
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,728
He took the bait.

413
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,396
What do you need it for?

414
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,068
I just need to show it to someone.

415
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,616
The game has begun.

416
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,410
Sleep well tonight.

417
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,090
SUITCASES BLOWOUT SALE

418
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,408
Hello.

419
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,707
Why are they not making a move?

420
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,463
-That's Noh Chang-gyu.
-Down!

421
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,590
They think we're dead. We can't be seen.

422
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,644
Which car should we tail?

423
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,147
-The one with the suitcases.
-Yes, obviously.

424
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,064
Let's go.

425
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,400
People called me a smart cookie
when I was little.

426
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
JUNGJIN FINANCE

427
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,077
Come on, hurry.

428
00:33:58,953 --> 00:33:59,954
Come on.

429
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,669
Jae-cheol, what are you doing?

430
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,380
I'm throwing money into a suitcase

431
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,552
Those guys need a break.

432
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,096
They're clearing out all the banks.

433
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,436
-Hey, move it.
-Jeez.

434
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,191
Looks like they'll keep taking cash out
until the banks close.

435
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,984
We should thank them for doing this.

436
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:39,035
But one of the cars
is at the reservoir now.

437
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,953
-What?
-The reservoir?

438
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,749
Oh, I think this is the one
that Noh Chang-gyu was in earlier.

439
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,877
Wait, Noh Chang-gyu
is at the reservoir now?

440
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,545
Hey, they're leaving.

441
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,756
My gosh.

442
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,342
They're gone.

443
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,653
Hey, you! How many hours
is this going to take?

444
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,656
I told you to just dig around
the transformer!

445
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,241
Damn it.

446
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,787
TRANSFORMER IN FRONT OF THE MOUNTAIN

447
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,038
This is it.

448
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,461
This is probably the last stop.

449
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,800
NOH HANG-GYU

450
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,269
Hey, I found it.

451
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,187
I rummaged through all the garbage here.

452
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,900
The yellow suitcase, right?

453
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,193
A suitcase?

454
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,155
-What?
-That's what he found at the reservoir.

455
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,406
A suitcase?

456
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,491
Not one of those?
There's another suitcase?

457
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,118
Oh, I see.

458
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,744
Mo-tak, it's 4 p.m. now.

459
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,455
Okay, let the operation begin.

460
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,017
Guys, quick.

461
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,194
-Hey, move.
-What?

462
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,656
Damn it. We've got a flat tire.

463
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,535
Hey, we've got a flat tire.

464
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,287
What's the insurance company for?

465
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,456
-Call them now!
-Okay, I'll call.

466
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,999
Hurry! We don't have time.

467
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,710
Jungang Insurance?

468
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,837
We've got a flat tire.

469
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,012
Hello, we just put in an emergency
service request due to a flat tire.

470
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,349
Oh, my husband did.
But you don't need to come.

471
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,434
It looks like it just lost a little air.

472
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,019
We can get it fixed on our own.

473
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,104
Sorry for the trouble. Yes, thank you.

474
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,522
And I love you back.

475
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,568
Mo-tak, come in.

476
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,502
I'm here from Jungang Insurance.

477
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,049
-What?
-What are you doing?

478
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,842
I'm taking out the spare tire.

479
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,387
-Don't touch anything. You do it.
-This is very heavy.

480
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,223
-Hey, man. I got this.
-My gosh. Thank you.

481
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,820
The car is too heavy right now.
Can you please step out?

482
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,071
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

483
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,864
This is ridiculous.

484
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,408
-What's he doing?
-Damn it.

485
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,577
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

486
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,955
-Gosh.
-What the hell?

487
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,416
-No!
-Gosh, hey!

488
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,500
-Hey, man.
-Goodness.

489
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,252
Oh, dear.

490
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,338
Jeez, what a joke.

491
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,424
That idiot. Does he even know
how to do it?

492
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,135
-This is ridiculous.
-Hey, close the trunk.

493
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,219
We don't have time.

494
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,097
Hey.

495
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,641
-Hey, look.
-Hey.

496
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,851
-Hey, man.
-Get up.

497
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,020
-Jeez!
-God, you scared the crap out of me.

498
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,855
-I'm so sorry.
-What the hell!

499
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,690
-This is nuts.
-I've got a leg cramp!

500
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,983
-No!
-Stay still.

501
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,029
Which side? Let me see.

502
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,030
Let me see.

503
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,906
We just need to knock that guy out.

504
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,367
-Hey, I told you.
-Hey.

505
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,952
Come on. Let me see!

506
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,289
Excuse me.

507
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,749
You're pretty.

508
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,043
Hey, gorgeous. What's up?

509
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,627
Peekaboo.

510
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,724
Oh, boy.

511
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,309
-My leg…
-Which one?

512
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,769
-I got it.
-Take his shoes off.

513
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,520
-If you take my shoes off…
-Goodness.

514
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,813
-This is gross.
-Gosh.

515
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,109
-The left one! Yes!
-Is it the left leg?

516
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,195
-Goodness gracious.
-This is gross.

517
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,996
-Sir.
-I'm tearing up.

518
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,956
-My gosh.
-Are you all right?

519
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,208
I think I'm better now.

520
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,417
Help me put my shoes on.

521
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,752
-Jeez.
-Here, help him.

522
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,587
-Man, you're so demanding.
-I'm sorry.

523
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,678
Hurry up, will you?

524
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,931
Yes, I'll get it done quickly.

525
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,892
-What now?
-Hey!

526
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,352
What's he doing?

527
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,812
-Hey!
-I'm slightly anemic.

528
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,563
-Jeez, this thing here...
-Hurry.

529
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,065
Hurry!

530
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,775
Gosh.

531
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,527
-Did you not have lunch?
-Hey, move!

532
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,736
Hey, hurry.

533
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,029
-Move!
-Wait.

534
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,114
Hey.

535
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,740
No, wait!

536
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,284
Be quiet.

537
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,204
Wait!

538
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,835
Jae-cheol.

539
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,504
I couldn't breathe for some reason.

540
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:25,923
Jae-cheol!

541
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,092
Hey, is it done?

542
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,260
It's almost done.

543
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,679
-Hurry up!
-Okay. I'll wake you up when it's done.

544
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,888
-Do it quickly.
-Okay.

545
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,351
This is odd. Why am I so tired?

546
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,062
The memory card?

547
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,448
It's all done now. Thank you.

548
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,700
-Jeez.
-Okay, bye. Get lost.

549
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,742
-Hop in.
-Okay.

550
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,077
-Let's get going!
-Hurry up.

551
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,370
We'll get going now.

552
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,801
Well done.

553
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,929
-Let's go to the reservoir.
-What?

554
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,764
Why?

555
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,392
The yellow suitcase Noh Chang-gyu found…

556
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,312
It must have something to do
with Kim Yeong-nim.

557
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,148
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone
all the way there

558
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,108
and dug it up himself.

559
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,527
Let's go.

560
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,112
Let's go.

561
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,411
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOH HANG-GYU

562
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,373
I think we need insurance.

563
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,167
"Insurance"?

564
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,544
The thing we buried at the reservoir.

565
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:51,967
Dig it up.

566
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,222
Yes, sir.

567
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,610
Damn it.

568
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,530
If that gets exposed, I'll be in trouble.

569
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,369
Hey, what should I do with this?

570
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,954
Take it to the office?

571
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,794
Gosh, can you decide quickly?

572
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,837
That stench is killing me.

573
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,549
I'll text you an address.
Drop it off there.

574
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,260
Hey, what the hell is inside
that suitcase?

575
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,844
Don't even be curious.

576
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,097
Forget what you saw today
after the job is done.

577
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,605
NOH CHANG-GYU

578
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:53,028
"Premium Oak Sauna
in Siyeong-dong, Jungjin"?

579
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,863
-What?
-"Oak Sauna"?

580
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,532
Why is he going there?

581
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,294
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

582
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,509
This is the place.

583
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,761
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

584
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,807
RED CLAY PREMIUM OAK SAUNA

585
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,982
What does he need to do here?

586
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,405
Take it out.

587
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,795
He might go the other way.

588
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:56,008
Ms. Chu and Ha-na,
go the other way and block the exit.

589
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,217
Okay.

590
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,561
Hello.

591
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,981
My, look at that solid flame.

592
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,777
The charcoal smells so good.

593
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,362
-Did you get the heads-up?
-Yes.

594
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,282
Here.

595
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,579
-Hey.
-Yes.

596
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,872
-Throw it in there.
-Okay.

597
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,457
I guess they're going to burn it.

598
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,958
They want to incinerate it.

599
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,586
Gosh! It's too hot.

600
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,504
What the hell?

601
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,297
Just throw it in there!

602
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,136
Ga Mo-tak.

603
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,431
Do you want me to throw you guys
in there too?

604
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,975
Shall I throw you guys in there?

605
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,066
No, don't!

606
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,487
We're back, Boss.

607
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,540
We took the money out
and closed all 17 accounts.

608
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,333
Well done.

609
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,924
Should I send these to Mayor Shin's camp?

610
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,926
Send them directly to Mayor Shin.

611
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,013
If he gets a whiff of cash,
he won't get any funny ideas.

612
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:25,931
Sir.

613
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,684
Would you like to see?

614
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,229
No need.

615
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,648
I have to send it off, so if I see it…

616
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,443
I won't want to let it go.

617
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,960
Hey! Wake up.

618
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,505
Where's the suitcase?

619
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,135
It's burning.

620
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,595
I only see the flame.

621
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,389
Why am I so dizzy?

622
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,390
Oh, me too.

623
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,227
Hey.

624
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,438
We did throw it in there, right?

625
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,108
I see that your hair is burnt.

626
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:19,610
What?

627
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,404
-Why is your hair burnt?
-Sorry?

628
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,495
What happened?

629
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,268
What? How could they
shove a person into this…

630
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,770
Don't touch it,

631
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,688
or it'll become inadmissible.

632
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,363
Let's pray for her soul.

633
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,960
What should we do?

634
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,963
I don't know how I feel about
letting the police know.

635
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,423
Mo-tak, you remember everything now.

636
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,217
Any cop you can trust?

637
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,886
If there were
even one colleague like that,

638
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,681
Jeong-yeong would still be alive.

639
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,519
And my former colleagues
must've changed a lot by now.

640
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,942
We have five billion won in cash

641
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,736
right beside a young woman's
skeletal remains.

642
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,531
Am I supposed to cry or laugh now?

643
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,993
Shin Myeong-hwi
must have a political rival.

644
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:52,911
Oh Yeong-deok?

645
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:54,955
Yes, good idea!

646
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,416
The police station in his constituency.

647
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,918
He won't try to cover it up at least.

648
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,962
In that precinct,

649
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,964
there's a detective I know.

650
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,343
Great. Tell him about the case
you were investigating seven years ago.

651
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809
GYEONGIN POLICE STATION

652
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:18,854
The autopsy will take a while
since we only have the skeleton.

653
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,940
I'll call you when we have the DNA info.

654
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,526
By the way,

655
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,903
the suspects you have in mind…

656
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,572
Are you sure it's them?

657
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,489
Yes.

658
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,658
I'll show you.

659
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,410
I'm scared to even confirm it.

660
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,203
So…

661
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,414
investigate it quietly.

662
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:39,750
I'm counting on you.

663
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,559
What is that?

664
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,145
Oh, that.

665
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,440
He looked homeless, so I killed him.

666
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,025
There won't be any problems.

667
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,986
No matter how much I eat,
I'm still hungry.

668
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,112
I'm sorry.

669
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,073
It stinks.

670
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,866
Get rid of it.

671
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,326
Will do.

672
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,661
We'll leave tomorrow.

673
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,456
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
KIM JI-YEON

674
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,958
Where did she go?

675
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,461
Hey, Baek Hyang-hui!

676
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,547
She went out with the voice recorder.

677
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,883
Hey!

678
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,717
Hand over that purse.

679
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,012
-What?
-So I can complete my look.

680
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,602
What does he want from me?

681
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,568
Babe?

682
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,823
Hey! Babe!

683
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,259
Where's my voice recorder?

684
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,013
I'll give it to you. I'll give it back!

685
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,061
I'm hungry.

686
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,522
Hey!

687
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,985
Hey, don't hurt the woman.

688
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,487
Let her go!

689
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,532
I'm hungry.

690
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,963
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

691
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:57,781
Mayor Shin, I'm a man of my word.

692
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:03,036
And you'll go on to achieve
greater things, so let's not dillydally.

693
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,287
We'll do this right away.

694
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,123
You're absolutely right.

695
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,001
Well, then…

696
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,547
Oh, you don't have to show me.

697
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,221
What is this?

698
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,307
Oh, what's with all the bottled water?

699
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,103
Why is this filled with bottled water?

700
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,075
Why is this filled with bottled water?

701
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,076
Water?

702
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,536
What's he saying?

703
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,833
Oh, my. You must've been parched.

704
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,545
Hey, what… What happened?

705
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,339
This is…

706
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,091
What's this?

707
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,895
My money.

708
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,983
-My money!
-Get out.

709
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,902
-Mr. Mayor.
-I said, get out!

710
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,112
My gosh.

711
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,909
-I didn't know you had other guests.
-Well…

712
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,078
There must've been some kind of error.

713
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,039
Let's eat together another time.

714
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:31,541
Just the two of us, with no one else.

715
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,667
Mr. Kim!

716
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,545
We're taking them back.

717
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,464
Hold on.

718
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:41,134
I'll wait for your call.

719
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,260
Okay.

720
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,184
Sir.

721
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,660
This is beyond embarrassing, you idiots!

722
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,082
Clearly write the names
of those three jerks

723
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,833
and submit them to the NFS.

724
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:18,630
They're DNA samples from the suspects
in the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

725
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,547
Yes, sir.

726
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,303
Do you expect me to believe that?

727
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,805
That's the situation now, sir.

728
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,642
If you can give us more time,
we'll try to get you about two billion.

729
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,810
Two billion?

730
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:33,937
Are you kidding me?

731
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,523
-Are you kidding me right now?
-No, sir.

732
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,025
You made me look like
a complete moron, and what?

733
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,319
Please give us about a week.

734
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,404
You piece of…

735
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,033
A week?

736
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,077
A week?

737
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,996
A whole week?

738
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,128
At your service, sir!

739
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,382
Damn it.

740
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,092
Shin Myeong-hwi.

741
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,845
Am I your bank or what?

742
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,348
We're talking 5 billion won here, not 500.

743
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,810
I'm the one who lost five billion won.

744
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,646
How dare he flip out on me?

745
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,398
-Bastards.
-No, wait.

746
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,733
You little...

747
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,568
How dare he dump water on my face?

748
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,490
You just wait and see.

749
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,201
I will never

750
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,912
forget this.

751
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:38,043
You little shit.
You even got rid of the dashcam footage.

752
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,669
Don't you dare play dumb!

753
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,047
Who took the money if you guys didn't?

754
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,924
-You bastards.
-No, please…

755
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,676
Please believe me. It wasn't us.

756
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,846
I really don't remember anything.

757
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,098
Is that so?

758
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,185
I'll help you refresh your memory.

759
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,853
-Down on all fours.
-No, please…

760
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,356
Let's say, 50,000 won each time.

761
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,941
Let's do this just 100,000 times.

762
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,235
-Get back up.
-Please…

763
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,155
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

764
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,949
It's okay. We have a long way to go.
Back on all fours.

765
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,743
-Get back up.
-Boss.

766
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,745
Boss, what's going on?

767
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,413
You little shit.

768
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,665
Please help me. It really wasn't me.

769
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,459
Hey, what?

770
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,380
I really don't remember anything.

771
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,882
You too?

772
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,930
Hang-gyu, I also don't remember anything
from yesterday.

773
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,183
What happened?

774
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,476
I don't remember anything.

775
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,019
I'm dumbfounded.

776
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,607
Sir.

777
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,443
Those rats. Could they be alive?

778
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,154
Who?

779
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,447
Ga Mo-tak.

780
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,698
What?

781
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,325
What? Ga Mo-tak is dead?

782
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,624
That little…

783
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,753
EONNI'S NOODLES

784
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,843
Stay still, will you?

785
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:13,388
He said he'd let me know
as soon as the results are out.

786
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,848
He'll call.

787
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,893
I'm worried things might go wrong.

788
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,440
We did our best, Mo-tak.

789
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,400
Yes.

790
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,319
We nearly died several times.

791
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,406
I just feel bad.

792
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,075
Even after death,

793
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,161
they can't rest in peace.

794
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,747
When I think about them…

795
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,215
Answer it.

796
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,596
Hello?

797
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:57,974
Yes.

798
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,269
Okay.

799
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,564
What did he say?

800
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,818
They did

801
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,070
a DNA analysis on the remains.

802
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,200
And what? Just tell us!

803
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,746
The one on her clothes
matches Noh Hang-gyu's.

804
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,663
My gosh.

805
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,584
The one found underneath her nails
matches Mayor Shin's.

806
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,793
-My gosh!
-Yes!

807
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,379
My gosh, we did it.

808
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,674
So Shin Myeong-hwi is now
a murder suspect, right?

809
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,176
Yes.

810
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:34,969
After seven years.

811
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,191
Mayor Shin.

812
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:55,657
We have to interview you
in regard to the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

813
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,991
Who?

814
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,495
You're a murder suspect now.

815
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,121
That is absurd.

816
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,250
Go get ready.

817
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,501
We'll wait here.

818
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,889
God damn it!

819
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,395
Ga Mo-tak, you bastard.

820
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,856
What is going on? Kim Yeong-nim…

821
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,693
Murder?

822
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,695
Chang-gyu just checked.

823
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,531
Those rats took Kim Yeong-nim's remains.

824
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,283
"Those rats"? Who?

825
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,953
-Ga Mo-tak.
-What?

826
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,496
But he's dead!

827
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,630
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu.

828
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,178
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kim Yeong-nim.

829
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,180
Come with us.

830
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,602
Shin Myeong-hwi!

831
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,061
-He's coming out!
-There he is!

832
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,646
-Mayor Shin!
-Mr. Mayor!

833
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,481
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-A comment, please!

834
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,150
-Is it true?
-Say a few words!

835
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,110
-Mr. Mayor!
-Did you really kill her?

836
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,695
-Is it true?
-We're on your side!

837
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,071
Tell us the truth!

838
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,866
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Is it true? Tell us.

839
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,034
Mr. Mayor!

840
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,910
-Do you admit it?
-Thank you.

841
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,412
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

842
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,705
-Move back.
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

843
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,166
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-A comment, please!

844
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,210
This is nothing
but a ridiculous political trap.

845
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,545
That bastard.

846
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,631
-Trust me.
-He hasn't learned his lesson yet.

847
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,840
Please protect me.

848
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,884
I'll clear up all the suspicions

849
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,678
and return to my post.

850
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,596
Thank you.

851
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,972
-We trust you!
-We trust you!

852
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:43,890
You can't come in.

853
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,391
-Move back.
-We'll protect you!

854
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,351
-Gosh.
-Mun.

855
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,936
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-We trust you!

856
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,813
-You can't do that.
-Oh, hold on.

857
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:52,607
Let him go.

858
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,691
Shin Myeong-hwi!

859
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,734
Shin Myeong-hwi!

860
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,943
Shin Myeong-hwi!

861
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,278
Shin Myeong-hwi!

862
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,905
How are your parents doing?

863
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,990
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

864
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,743
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

865
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,495
You guys all seem to be doing well.

866
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,830
I'm relieved.

867
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,875
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

868
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,294
-Shin Myeong-hwi!
-Shin Myeong-hwi!

869
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:15,588
Don't think this will end
with Kim Yeong-nim.

870
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,883
My mom and dad.

871
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,136
I'll make you pay for everything you did.

872
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,473
How have you been, Father?

873
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,267
Shut up, asshole!

874
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,560
You haven't changed a bit.

875
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,312
Ji Cheong-sin and the evil spirit
have become one.

876
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,065
What's going to happen
to my mom and dad's souls?

877
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,775
You told me not to worry about it.

878
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,402
Then why are you here?

879
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,778
The video footage.

880
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,156
This is the highlight.

881
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,199
How are we supposed to catch him?

882
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,118
By binding him.

883
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,412
I spotted one. Where's So Mun?

884
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,541
I summon Ji Cheong-sin, the evil spirit!

885
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,627
