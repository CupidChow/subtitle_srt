00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, INCIDENTS

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,978
AND OCCUPATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,564
EPISODE 16

4
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,071
STRIKE AGAINST DEMOLITION

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,671
REVEAL THE TRUTH
AND PUNISH ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE

6
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,312
He has become stronger.

7
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,952
Did you think you could handle me
when you were this weak?

8
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,334
Mo-tak!

9
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,597
Did I get the right leg?

10
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,075
No!

11
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,042
Mun.

12
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,752
Mun.

13
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,096
Listen up, Mun.

14
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,847
At the very end,

15
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,976
we may not be with you.

16
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770
You know what I'm trying to say, right?

17
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,939
Shin Myeong-hwi is pure evil.

18
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,317
You may have to finish him off
on your own, Mun.

19
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,697
So get up and fight,

20
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,283
no matter what.

21
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,751
Mun!

22
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,753
Mun.

23
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,548
The three of us have already died once,

24
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,342
so we'll gladly die again for your sake.

25
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,636
So let's heal your leg first.

26
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,138
Your leg--

27
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,222
No.

28
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,434
Thank you.

29
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,228
Thank you, Ms. Chu.

30
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,564
I'm grateful to all of you.

31
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,360
But…

32
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,156
I'm more comfortable
with my leg like this anyway.

33
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,449
No.

34
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,284
Mun, don't.

35
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,078
No, Mun!

36
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,871
Oh, my. He's definitely the ace
of our team.

37
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,439
Mun is really…

38
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,066
marvelous.

39
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,410
Fine.

40
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,830
I suppose you're determined
to meet your parents today.

41
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,373
This son of a bitch…

42
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,375
I summon

43
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,544
the evil spirit in him!

44
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,802
All right. You do that.

45
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,223
But just so you know,
you won't be able to see

46
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,267
those old farts you live with after this.

47
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,813
What… What do you mean?

48
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,699
What happened to my grandparents?

49
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,329
Who do you think is inside that car?

50
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
My gosh.

51
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,525
Honey, wake up.

52
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,027
This is… What on earth happened?

53
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,403
The choice is yours.

54
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,576
Will you choose your dead parents
over your grandparents who are alive?

55
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,290
No!

56
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,627
Mun.

57
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,003
We've got this.

58
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,846
I'll stop the truck!

59
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,100
No…

60
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,192
Oh, gosh.

61
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,033
He's playing another psychokinetic trick
on this. It won't even budge!

62
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,789
Can't you see?

63
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,794
I'm the only one who can make sure
this accident doesn't take place.

64
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,186
No.

65
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,356
I believe

66
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,567
in Mo-tak,

67
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,444
Ha-na,

68
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,696
and us together as a team.

69
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,285
I believe in us, you bastard!

70
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,901
At times, things will feel unfair

71
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,320
And drive you to the brink of tears

72
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,323
-For no reason
-For no reason

73
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:02,036
For ordinary people
Who never win first place

74
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,540
Mom.

75
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,835
Mun, what's wrong?

76
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,346
Getting applause

77
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,724
Mun, no. Snap out of it!

78
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,975
Mom…

79
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,614
Mun, no. That is not your mom.
Don't let him fool you!

80
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,658
You must save your mom and dad.

81
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,702
You must save them!

82
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,500
Please! It's time to go,
you son of a bitch!

83
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,506
What?

84
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,273
You did it.

85
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,442
Well done.

86
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,863
-Gosh.
-Oh, dear.

87
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,952
Hey, are you both okay?

88
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,580
Well done, guys.

89
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,210
Mun, you did it.

90
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,965
Ha-na.

91
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,761
We did it!

92
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,681
We outdid that devil's
psychokinetic powers.

93
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,893
If it weren't for me and Ha-na,

94
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,979
we'd be in deep trouble now.

95
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,523
We pulled it off.

96
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,733
Gosh, it's all over now.

97
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,005
Mun.

98
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,886
Yes?

99
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,351
Is it all over now?

100
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,021
What about my mom and dad?

101
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,107
And my grandparents?

102
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,900
They're all fine.

103
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,780
Thank you. Thank you so much.

104
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,116
No, we should thank you.

105
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,368
All of us.

106
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,830
All the souls that were trapped inside

107
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,207
will ascend to Yung soon.

108
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,503
Then you'll finally be able
to meet your parents.

109
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,130
In strict accordance
with the laws of Yung,

110
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,593
I shall hand you over
to the judicial authorities as a criminal.

111
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,257
I bet you think it's over now.

112
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,886
This fight will go on forever.

113
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,639
Your cursed fate

114
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,809
will lead you to a painful death.

115
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,687
And everyone around you

116
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,023
will also die like that because of you.

117
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,777
No.

118
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,698
I don't care even if
this is only the beginning.

119
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,702
Until the day when
there isn't a single evil spirit left,

120
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,954
I will fight

121
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,248
ceaselessly.

122
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:48,215
And the most important thing is…

123
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,557
the fact that you're finished,
you bastard.

124
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,587
Thank goodness his grandparents are okay.
I've erased their memories.

125
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,048
The truck driver is okay too.

126
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,134
I'll take Mun's grandparents home.

127
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,552
What about Shin Myeong-hwi?

128
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,806
He's fallen back into a coma
now that the evil spirit is gone.

129
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,351
What if he never wakes up and just dies?
That won't happen, right?

130
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,602
We can't let that happen.

131
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,938
He must pay for what he did.

132
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,815
Don't worry.

133
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,901
This world isn't such an easy place.

134
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,863
I'll take him to the best hospital
in the country and make sure he lives.

135
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,241
-Hey, Mo-tak.
-Yes?

136
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,285
Shouldn't you go see a doctor too?

137
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,495
Oh, maybe…

138
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,666
Why did you do that strongman stunt
in the middle of the road?

139
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,459
I thought you were a stunt performer.

140
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,461
What? "Strongman stunt"?

141
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,923
Do you know why I did all that…?

142
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,591
If it weren't for me, we'd be…

143
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,677
-Just drop it.
-I'll carry Mun on my back.

144
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,763
You're worse than him.
You're such a meanie, Ha-na.

145
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,682
I wonder if he's met them.

146
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,227
Yes, I know. You did a great job.
Well done.

147
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,104
-Yes, you did a good job.
-Move.

148
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,689
All right.

149
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,110
Hey, does this mean we're really dead?

150
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,736
I can't believe this.

151
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,990
Why is this place all white?
Are we in heaven?

152
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,825
You idiot, how can we be in heaven?

153
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,410
You know we don't deserve that.

154
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,578
What did we do wrong?

155
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,289
All I did was follow orders and work hard.

156
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,584
Right. But they were all for bad stuff,
you fool.

157
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,003
Whatever. I'm going to pray.

158
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,296
It's not too late yet.

159
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,131
Well, better late than never.

160
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,092
Jeez, why are you praying?
You're not even religious.

161
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,386
Please…

162
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,347
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
I don't want to die.

163
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,516
Please let me live. I'll work very hard.

164
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,268
I'll be good. Please…

165
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,854
Please give me a chance.

166
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,856
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

167
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,358
-We'll do anything and everything.
-Give us a chance.

168
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,611
Please give us a chance. Please.

169
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,027
If we're dead,

170
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,529
what about Mun?

171
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,824
My baby, Mun…

172
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,369
He's only 11.

173
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,027
Will Mun's parents

174
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,614
recognize him? He's 18 now, you know.

175
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,491
I'm not sure.

176
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,160
Too much time has passed.

177
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,084
We got into a car accident

178
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,920
and were locked inside an evil spirit
all this time?

179
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,133
You probably feel as though
you just woke up from a long, deep sleep.

180
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:42,968
However,

181
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,220
seven years have passed.

182
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,763
Seven years?

183
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,433
No way. Seven years?

184
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,768
Then what about our son?

185
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,145
How old would Mun be now?

186
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,398
He'd be 18.

187
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,774
My gosh.

188
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,153
Gosh, what kind of parent does this?

189
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,362
I had no idea.

190
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,825
It was just yesterday.

191
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,869
Just yesterday,

192
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,164
Mun was sitting behind us in the car.

193
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,459
And we said we'd go on a trip.

194
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,754
Come on, Mun!

195
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,549
Draw us in your storybook. Please?

196
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,634
We'll join you, for sure.

197
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,386
I mean it. Pinky swear.

198
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,138
Come on.

199
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,639
My arm's getting tired.

200
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,106
We broke our promise again.

201
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,567
-We never got to keep our word.
-Mun.

202
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,570
Wait, well…

203
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,657
This boy here

204
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,995
saved the two of you.

205
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,374
Thank you.

206
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,468
Mun, my baby…

207
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,353
Would you like to

208
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:20,023
sit down and have some tea?

209
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,277
We'll talk again after you've calmed down.

210
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,362
This way, please.

211
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,587
Thank you

212
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,381
for saving us.

213
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,051
No problem.

214
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,035
Oh, wait.

215
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,005
What? How…?

216
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,425
No. No way. How…?

217
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,302
Mun…

218
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,516
No. My gosh.

219
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,692
My son.

220
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,236
My son, Mun.

221
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,238
You're Mun.

222
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,325
Mun.

223
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,332
Of course I'd recognize my son.

224
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,918
You're Mun, right?

225
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,546
Yes, you are my son. I'm sure of it.

226
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,092
Mun saved us?

227
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,557
My gosh, you're all grown up now.

228
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,768
I wasn't even there for you.

229
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,688
How did you grow up like this without me?

230
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,734
You grew up all alone, and I…

231
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,446
Mom's so sorry.

232
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,366
I've done nothing for you.

233
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,369
I was never even there for you.

234
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,538
Are you really my son?

235
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,041
You're really Mun?

236
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,420
Mun.

237
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,714
Say something.

238
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,467
It's okay. Talk to us.

239
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,103
It was all a lie.

240
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,646
What?

241
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,816
When I said my tummy hurt,

242
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,528
complained about headaches,

243
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,698
and said I forgot to bring my homework…

244
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,702
They were all…

245
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,497
lies.

246
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,459
-Mun.
-That day too.

247
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,880
The day of the accident.

248
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,009
I actually had my homework with me.

249
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,678
I had remembered to bring everything,

250
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,433
but I lied to you two

251
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,980
because I really missed you.

252
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,273
I'm sorry.

253
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,317
No, don't be.

254
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,446
Your mom and I were always so busy.

255
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,240
We're really sorry, Mun.

256
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,867
You know,

257
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,787
there was something
I really wanted to tell you.

258
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,874
That accident…

259
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,461
I thought you two ended up like that

260
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,171
because of…

261
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,258
My whole life,
I felt like it was all my fault.

262
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,594
I…

263
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,056
I don't have to feel that way
anymore, right?

264
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,933
I don't have to think like that anymore?

265
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,319
You know,

266
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,031
you can be proud of me.

267
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,616
Everyone says

268
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,659
I look a lot like Dad

269
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,120
and that I'm easygoing like you, Mom.

270
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,832
So…

271
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,211
Mom, Dad.

272
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,381
Rest in peace now.

273
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,884
Let's not feel sorry for one another.

274
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,096
I want you to be at peace

275
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,349
and happy now.

276
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,061
I'll… I will do the same.

277
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,313
I…

278
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,109
Mom, Dad. I love you very much.

279
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,653
-Hurry up, Mun!
-Mun!

280
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,499
-Mun!
-Mun!

281
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,170
Mom, Dad. I missed you.

282
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,263
We love you, Mun.

283
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,831
Be careful.

284
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,793
Jeez, that scared me.

285
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,421
Mun looks so happy.

286
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,550
He looks like a baby
now that he's finally met his parents.

287
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,096
I've never seen him smile like this.

288
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,055
Weirdo.

289
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,350
They must have a lot to catch up on.

290
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,352
Even catching up all night
won't be enough.

291
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,176
EONNI'S NOODLES

292
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,719
Gosh, I'm nervous.

293
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,346
Let's go.

294
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,431
All right, guys. Are you ready?

295
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,682
Yes, for some time now.

296
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,683
Okay.

297
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,355
One, two, three.

298
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,824
What? Why are we still here?

299
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,159
Is this some kind of system error?

300
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,786
Did they lie to us again?

301
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,788
Let's try one more time.

302
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,514
What?

303
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,308
How…

304
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,730
Cheol-jung.

305
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,524
Then this must be…

306
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,988
I figured it'd be better for us
to meet here.

307
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,782
I put in a special request
with the folks in Yung.

308
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,326
Cheol-jung!

309
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,787
How long has it been?

310
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,207
-Yes, come here.
-My gosh.

311
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,835
-Cheol-jung.
-Hey.

312
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,922
-Let's go
-Let's go

313
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,633
Hey, man. Calm down.

314
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,176
-Guys, let's sit down.
-Okay.

315
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,013
-Oh, boy.
-My gosh.

316
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,937
Thanks to you guys,

317
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,607
we get to meet again like this.

318
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,902
Thanks a lot, all of you.

319
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,864
And you've been taking
such good care of my family.

320
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,200
Because of her son who died a bachelor,

321
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,994
my mother must've been devastated.

322
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:55,872
Thank you so much.

323
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,291
Come on. Of course
we should take care of her.

324
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,253
Hey, let me make you
a nice bowl of noodles.

325
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,548
-I'll put some water on the stove.
-Oh, wait.

326
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,674
No mushrooms, please.

327
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,052
Jeez, don't you worry.
I haven't forgotten that.

328
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,097
Wow, my gosh.

329
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,018
By the way, I heard that my successor

330
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,187
is amazing, just like me.

331
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,523
I heard you're no match for him.

332
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,154
That's not really true.

333
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,449
He's just…
A little better than me, I'd say.

334
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,577
But I wouldn't say he's like you.

335
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,788
From his looks
to his skills and abilities,

336
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,458
he's just like me, his mentor.
He's like a mini-me.

337
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,876
Is he that ugly?

338
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:44,712
Hey, you're handsome.

339
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,381
So is Mun.

340
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,800
As for me… Everyone already knows.

341
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,010
He's at it again. Goodness.

342
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,470
Stop talking nonsense!

343
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,140
Cheol-jung, what was it like
to be trapped inside the evil spirit?

344
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,769
Don't even bring it up
if you've never experienced it.

345
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,271
-Here we go again.
-Tell us! I want to hear it.

346
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,189
Fine, tell us.

347
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,525
As you know, the evil spirit was…

348
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,527
-My goodness.
-Come on. Keep listening.

349
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,571
-Hear me out.
-You haven't changed one bit.

350
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,574
-I'm telling you.
-Goodness.

351
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,159
What? Come on.

352
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,292
This is the voice recorder
that Ji Cheong-sin had.

353
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,838
There's a recording

354
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,426
of Shin Myeong-hwi's voice telling him
to get rid of me and So Gwon.

355
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,931
And here's a list of people
who went missing after meeting Shin.

356
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,309
It's very likely
that he killed all of them,

357
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,602
so search his place first.

358
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,979
MISSING PERSONS

359
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,399
You may be able to find some remains.

360
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,609
Shin Myeong-hwi…

361
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,696
He's a mayor. How could he…

362
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,364
How could he do this?

363
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,284
Detective Kim Jeong-yeong was right.

364
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,620
She said I'll realize later on that

365
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,623
some people are just plain evil.

366
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,794
But there are people like you who catch

367
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,465
and take down such demons.

368
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,139
Do you plan to return to the force?

369
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,644
Once I wrap this up, I'll go back

370
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,396
to what I was doing.

371
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,315
What is that?

372
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,483
Just something.

373
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,943
Something very important.

374
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,490
Mr. Noh Hang-gyu, are you saying

375
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,909
that you admit to killing Kim Yeong-nim?

376
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:43,206
It had nothing to do
with Shin Myeong-hwi or Cho Tae-sin?

377
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,374
Correct.

378
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,921
Then let's talk about Noh Chang-gyu now.

379
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,925
Chang-gyu? Why are you bringing him up
all of a sudden?

380
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,803
Haven't you heard?

381
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,640
He was found dead
at Shin Myeong-hwi's residence.

382
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,391
What? Dead?

383
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,770
What the hell are you talking about?

384
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,771
Sir.

385
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,439
Is Chang-gyu…

386
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,025
He's dead?

387
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,197
-This is my first time hearing about it.
-Bullshit!

388
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,659
We listened to the call recordings
on his phone,

389
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,995
so we know it was you, Cho Tae-sin.

390
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,124
Sir.

391
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,084
Sir!

392
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,629
Hey, Cho Tae-sin!

393
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,966
-Tell me. How did my brother die?
-Sit down.

394
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,218
-How did my brother die?
-Sit down!

395
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,011
-Stop him.
-I didn't kill him.

396
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,304
I didn't kill him!

397
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,266
-I'll kill you all.
-Try all you want, you bastard!

398
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,892
-Hey, stop him!
-Kill me!

399
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,352
Noh Hang-gyu, sit down!

400
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,781
You sold your conscience

401
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,617
and turned a blind eye
to your friend's death.

402
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,661
What did you get in return?

403
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,872
Are you happy now?

404
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,127
In my eyes, it looks like
you're feeling very uncomfortable,

405
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,297
guilty, and tormented at the moment.

406
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,050
I have nothing to say.

407
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,553
Zero, one, zero, four, nine, seven…

408
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,054
010-497-4536

409
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,556
Four, five, three, six.

410
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,516
Isn't that your old number, Ms. Jang?

411
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,144
Seven years ago, you tried

412
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,354
to send me a tip
on the Kim Yeong-nim case.

413
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,025
Excuse me. Don't I know you?

414
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,318
I'm… Hold on.

415
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,153
-You have to leave.
-Haven't we met?

416
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,032
Oh! You're Kim Yeong-nim's friend,
aren't you?

417
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,159
Wasn't that you, Ms. Jang?

418
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,494
We have enough evidence

419
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,290
to prove all the crimes
that Shin has committed,

420
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,667
except for Kim Yeong-nim's murder.

421
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,753
You're now the only one who can help us

422
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,299
prove that she was murdered
by Shin Myeong-hwi.

423
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,305
JUNGJIN POLICE STATION

424
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,976
I'm sending a video clip

425
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,314
that can be used as evidence to prove
that Shin killed Yeong-nim.

426
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,234
And I'll also

427
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,028
turn myself in.

428
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,705
I heard you seemed to be recovering.
I'm glad I stopped by.

429
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,707
Talk about perfect timing.

430
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,834
Who are you?

431
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,420
What is this place?

432
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,464
I'm Kang Han-ul
from Jungjin Police Station.

433
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,174
And you're in the hospital now.

434
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,551
How long have I been here?

435
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,390
I don't remember anything.

436
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,600
That's okay.

437
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,936
We've secured solid evidence.

438
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,020
What?

439
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:54,897
Mr. Shin Myeong-hwi.

440
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,902
You're under arrest for
the murders of Kim Yeong-nim,

441
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,114
Noh Chang-gyu, Lim Jae-cheol,
and many others, as well as for

442
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,866
solicitation of murder, bribery,
and illegal dumping.

443
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,665
What are you doing?

444
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,376
Get that off my wrist now.

445
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,926
A shocking scandal has broken out
surrounding Mayor Shin Myeong-hwi

446
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,429
and Chairman Cho Tae-sin's
criminal charges, including

447
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,389
murder, solicitation of murder,
and bribery.

448
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,683
This unprecedented case
is causing a lot of stir.

449
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,143
Finally, the truth is out.

450
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,563
In the midst of the discovery
of additional evidence,

451
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,898
another voice recording
from an anonymous source

452
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,901
was delivered to News Time
earlier this afternoon.

453
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,863
-A voice recording?
-Please note that

454
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,824
we bleeped out any offensive language
in the recording.

455
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,119
I worked on one of Shin Myeong-hwi's
murder cases seven years ago

456
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:54,874
with the police couple whose murder
was staged as a traffic accident.

457
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,752
I'm in a completely different line
of work now,

458
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,503
but I also nearly died back then.

459
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,007
Because of that worthless piece of…
That son of… Damn it.

460
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,759
Why did they disguise your voice?

461
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,218
Anyone could tell it's you.

462
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,137
No, that's not me.

463
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,305
Gosh, be quiet.

464
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,098
Mo-tak's on TV now.

465
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,561
And that recent death of a police officer,
which was staged as a suicide,

466
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,563
was also orchestrated by those

467
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,232
who were trying to cover up Shin's crimes.

468
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,278
Lastly, I'd like to express my respect
for those who fight for justice

469
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,447
even in the toughest situations.

470
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,452
Gosh, Mo-tak. It's such a shame that

471
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,704
we didn't get to see
your handsome face on TV.

472
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,414
What are you talking about?

473
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,792
He has a nice voice,
but he's not handsome.

474
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,710
-I'm handsome.
-Jeez.

475
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,669
Gosh, you.

476
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:43,214
-People are praising you on social media.
-Really?

477
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,548
-Nice!
-Let me see.

478
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,259
-You're so cool, Mo-tak.
-Well done!

479
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,095
"He probably has a nice voice too."

480
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,096
Oh, look!

481
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,848
-What?
-Did we order something?

482
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,309
-Oh, Jin-ho!
-My gosh!

483
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,852
-Oh, my goodness.
-Hey.

484
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,687
-You can put it here.
-What's all this?

485
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,772
They're corn dogs.

486
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,690
-Corn dogs!
-Corn dogs! Let me see.

487
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,151
-Wow.
-Let me see.

488
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,945
-My gosh.
-I love these corn dogs.

489
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:06,987
-Wow.
-Oh, my.

490
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,114
Nice.

491
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,534
They're good, so I got you guys some.

492
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,744
-My gosh.
-Are you sure you don't want one?

493
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,329
Yes, eat up.

494
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,206
This cheese is to die for.

495
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,125
Maybe we should switch to selling these.

496
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,504
Oh, right. An anonymous sponsor
donated ten billion won

497
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,173
to an environmental organization
in Jungjin.

498
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,425
Really?

499
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,177
I wonder who donated so much money.

500
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,139
My gosh, it must be someone
who loves to spend money.

501
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,101
I have no idea, but the world
isn't such a bad place after all.

502
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,813
That's right! There are
many warmhearted people in this world.

503
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,660
-I'm home.
-Many are grieving

504
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,371
the deaths of the police couple,

505
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,457
-Mr. So Gwon and Ms. Ha Mun-yeong.
-Hey, Mun.

506
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,749
Lieutenant So…

507
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,420
No! No, my baby… My daughter.

508
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,423
-Bring my daughter back.
-Honey.

509
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,219
My daughter! Bring my baby back.

510
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
Calm down. Come here.

511
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,763
Please, honey.

512
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,352
I'm sure you've heard the news
about your parents.

513
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,190
I'm sorry, Mun.

514
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,777
I had no idea. And all this time…

515
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,656
I didn't even know
my daughter had died like that.

516
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,618
My sweetie…

517
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,454
Bring back my daughter.

518
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,116
Me? Why should I meet your parents?
Why on earth?

519
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,952
-Jeez.
-Gosh, no way.

520
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,457
You want them to meet your girlfriend?

521
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,292
No, don't get the wrong idea.

522
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,587
You said you're meeting them
for the last time before they leave Yung.

523
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,382
Why do you want them to meet Ha-na?

524
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,551
I'm your mentor, the one who trained you.

525
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,760
What about me?

526
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,430
Well, I support this.

527
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,807
Yes, you have my support.

528
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,936
Well, I just want you to meet

529
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,813
my mom and dad.

530
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,275
They're serious now.

531
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,026
-Yes, why step in?
-Why bother them?

532
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,654
What the… You stepped in first.

533
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,705
Your name is Ha-na?

534
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:03,664
Yes.

535
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,792
-Even your name is so pretty.
-Gosh, Mom.

536
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,627
Don't stare at her like that.

537
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,838
She's like a younger version of you.

538
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,423
She's totally Mun's type.

539
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,217
-Dad, she can hear you.
-Oh, sorry.

540
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,721
Why give them the wrong idea, Mun?

541
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,307
I thought you guys should meet. Say hello.

542
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,977
Your grandma and grandpa must adore her.

543
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,270
Yes, they do.

544
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,411
Is there anything you'd like to tell them?

545
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,330
Mun's grandparents.

546
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:09,938
Thank you, Ha-na.

547
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,650
I just thought it'd be more vivid
through you.

548
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,569
Just summon our territory
so it can feel more vivid.

549
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,626
Grandma, Grandpa.

550
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,962
I'm sorry.

551
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,589
This is

552
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,134
the only thing I can do for you.

553
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,492
EONNI'S NOODLES

554
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,248
My gosh.

555
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,126
Ms. Chu! I'm here.

556
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,628
What brings you here?

557
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,506
-What's this car?
-Oh, this.

558
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,840
My secret favorite.

559
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,218
Korean cars are the most comfortable.

560
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,931
Today, I brought my absolute favorite car.

561
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:32,975
Today?

562
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,143
-Is it some kind of special day?
-Hop in.

563
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,521
-Keep your promise.
-What promise?

564
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,106
Where are we going this late?

565
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,694
You said you'd go for a drive with me
if you came back in one piece.

566
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,529
I believed you,

567
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,949
so I pushed that huge truck
with all my might…

568
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,160
Oh, dear. This is why

569
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:56,373
you always have to get a signed pledge
for things like this.

570
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,374
Okay, let's go.

571
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,084
We'll go, okay? Stop yelling.

572
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,044
-So we're going for a drive?
-Yes!

573
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:02,879
Then hop in!

574
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,883
I should go get changed.
It's my first date in years.

575
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,846
It's a date?

576
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,686
-Don't come back.
-Gosh, you scared me.

577
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,812
What are you saying?

578
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,814
Don't come home tonight.

579
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,983
You little punk, I'm offended.

580
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,985
-What are you thinking?
-I know everything.

581
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,195
-What? Have you lost your mind?
-Ms. Chu.

582
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,073
-This, you know?
-You crazy punk! You nutjob.

583
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,626
My, what a beautiful night view.

584
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,961
Right?

585
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,678
She usually doesn't sleep much.

586
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,203
Thank goodness everyone is okay.

587
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,500
We'll never lose another teammate.

588
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,378
I won't let that happen.

589
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,051
You did great, Mo-tak.

590
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,720
My gosh. Not as great as you, Ha-na.

591
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,847
Well, that's true.

592
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,645
Oh, were Mun's grandparents
able to let go of their grief a little?

593
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,397
I hope so.

594
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:45,816
It's important

595
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:50,153
to sort out your feelings
and thoughts once in a while.

596
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,616
Even if you try hard
not to notice your wounds,

597
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,493
they don't go away.

598
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,579
They'll remain in the corners
of your heart and keep hurting you.

599
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,044
Ha-na, how do you feel?

600
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:06,962
What?

601
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,548
All sorted out?

602
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,262
Nothing's hurting you?

603
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,121
Hi, Ha-yeong.

604
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,373
Hi, Mom and Dad.

605
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,221
The reasons as to why you did it

606
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,140
and how you could do such a thing…

607
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,103
I still can't wrap my head around it.
And I…

608
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,939
refuse to understand.

609
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,191
But,

610
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,652
that day…

611
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,614
Even if it was a dream,

612
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,913
I was happy to see you again.

613
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,606
Ung-min! Ju-yeon!

614
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:38,947
Gosh, Mun looks so happy.

615
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,490
Right?

616
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,326
He looks like he got into college
or something.

617
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,829
Ta-da!

618
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,038
Nice.

619
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,416
-What is this?
-It's still warm.

620
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,834
You're in 12th grade now.

621
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,086
I'll take care of you
so you can study hard.

622
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,881
What about you?

623
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,799
You're also in 12th grade now.

624
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:00,010
Right. I am, but…

625
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,388
Oh, I'm a 12th grader too.

626
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,307
This is too hot.

627
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,934
Hey, he's a hero.
He shouldn't have to study.

628
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,687
He just needs… His powers!

629
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,981
His superpowers.

630
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,818
But even a hero
can't be too ignorant, right?

631
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,072
-If you have no knowledge in your--
-Hey!

632
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,241
I'm studying art and sports.

633
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,952
Anyway, I'll take care of you guys

634
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,913
until we graduate. Does that sound good?

635
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,456
-I want more of this.
-Sure.

636
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,291
Mun.

637
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,586
Hey, don't you go to our school?

638
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,839
Mun, Hyeok-u assembled my friends again.

639
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,757
What?

640
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,971
-That jerk.
-Hey, hold on.

641
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,556
Why? Look how scared they are…

642
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,101
No, Hyeok-u is

643
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,605
apologizing to them.

644
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,816
I'm sorry, guys.

645
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,863
I don't expect you to forgive me.

646
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,839
I was flustered that day,
so I couldn't say anything.

647
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,549
Right.

648
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,595
I was going to call you after I drop out.

649
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,138
You're dropping out?

650
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,809
Thank you, for that day.

651
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,477
And…

652
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,105
I'm sorry, Ung-min.

653
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,818
I'm sorry, Mun.

654
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,153
And you too, Ju-yeon.

655
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,012
This feels so weird.

656
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,930
I feel uneasy right now.

657
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,349
But I also feel like

658
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,395
some of my pent-up resentment
is going away.

659
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,494
-Shall we begin?
-Yes.

660
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,125
All right. You may play the recording.

661
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,209
PROSECUTION

662
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,215
Someone else is on the Kim Yeong-nim case?

663
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,550
In addition to Ga Mo-tak?

664
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,720
Did you find out who it is?

665
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,265
Yes, a detective at
the Nambu Police Agency. So Gwon.

666
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,892
So Gwon?

667
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,228
The one who was investigating
the election campaign fund?

668
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,647
Shall I send my boys out
to scare him a little?

669
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,610
Let's not take a detour.

670
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,111
Just kill them both.

671
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,654
Ga Mo-tak, So Gwon.

672
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,989
-What?
-My gosh.

673
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,407
-Gosh.
-I can't believe this.

674
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,325
This is insane.

675
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,830
PROSECUTION

676
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,083
Defendant Shin Myeong-hwi.

677
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,919
Is that your voice?

678
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,047
Do you admit to making that remark?

679
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,716
Defendant.

680
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,468
Answer the prosecutor's question.

681
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,518
I…

682
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:41,940
admit it.

683
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,870
I will announce the verdict.

684
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,039
Based on the recording

685
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,042
of the defendant's voice
giving orders to kill So Gwon,

686
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,961
as well as the testimony

687
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:07,132
of the defendant's son who saw
the person who received the orders,

688
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:11,636
there is no doubt that the defendant
indeed ordered the murders

689
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,931
of the victims, So Gwon and Ha Mun-yeong.

690
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:17,517
Ergo, the defendant is guilty.

691
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,185
-My gosh.
-Thank goodness.

692
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,153
Well done.

693
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,072
-My gosh.
-Thank God.

694
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,212
I really hope you stay healthy.

695
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,133
You got a life sentence,
so I hope you live long.

696
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,059
When I found out it was a murder,
not an accident,

697
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,897
I got so angry
that I felt like I was going crazy.

698
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,738
But now that I'm seeing you like this,

699
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,618
I'm so proud of my parents
who lost their lives

700
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,661
while trying to catch you.

701
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,957
I will never forgive you.

702
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,677
Mun, what do you want? Sprite or Coke?

703
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,513
Half and half.

704
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,809
Mo-tak, soju or beer?

705
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:42,769
A soju bomb.

706
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,773
Hey, you're a minor.

707
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,441
Just until this year.

708
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,656
ONE MONTH LATER

709
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,533
The whole country?

710
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,618
You should send us on vacation
if anything.

711
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,161
Patrol the whole country?

712
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,579
This is too cruel.

713
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,041
It's such a relief that we eradicated
the absolute evil,

714
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,336
but some evil spirits are hiding
in areas that we've been neglecting.

715
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,549
Korea is a small country.

716
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,133
Just work hard for a month and--

717
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,511
Then why don't you do it yourself?

718
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,305
We're still recovering
from our last fight with Shin.

719
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,140
What? Go around the whole country?

720
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,560
-We don't even know where they're hiding.
-Right!

721
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,063
We arrived at this decision
after long and careful consideration.

722
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,439
It's all thanks to Mun.

723
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,149
What? Mun?

724
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,443
-Hey, was this your idea?
-What?

725
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,320
No! I never said anything like that.

726
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,447
-U-sik, what are you talking about?
-No, no.

727
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,618
It's because Mun has the ability
to summon our territory.

728
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,370
Wait, hold on a second.

729
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,039
Don't tell me you actually expect me
to go around

730
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,083
the whole country
and summon our territory.

731
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,711
Summoning our territory isn't an easy job.

732
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,754
You folks are working him like a dog.

733
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,549
We understand you're short-handed,
so we're discussing

734
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,426
ways to hire more Counters.

735
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,969
Give us a little bit of time.

736
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:00,972
Gosh, okay.

737
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,057
I guess we have no choice.

738
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,978
Let's just think that we're going on
a cross-country road trip together.

739
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,187
I like this idea.

740
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,647
-You little brat.
-Gosh!

741
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,232
-Hey!
-I'll teach you a lesson.

742
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,735
-You, come here!
-How dare you!

743
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,820
-Get back here!
-You're really something.

744
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,918
It's all right. I have nine more anyway.

745
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,295
I have 20 more.

746
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:37,175
But why do we have to wear this
all the time?

747
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,345
-Be quiet, will you?
-Okay.

748
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,266
This is just wrong.

749
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,019
I'll go back to Yung and negotiate with--

750
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,437
Negotiate? As if.

751
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,814
You can't even put your foot down.

752
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,858
I should've stopped you when you said

753
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,277
you were going there to put in
a vacation request.

754
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,698
By the way, will they manage
to find a new Counter?

755
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,867
So I won't be the newbie anymore?

756
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,702
Why? So you can discipline the newbie?

757
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,870
Yes, of course.

758
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:06,788
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

759
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,122
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Gosh.

760
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,958
Whatever, I don't care.
We're not machines.

761
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,835
-We're not.
-Right, we need a break.

762
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,462
We should eat well and recharge.

763
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,589
It'll help us catch more evil spirits.

764
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,715
-Yes.
-Let's play!

765
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,425
-Okay.
-Mun, find a good restaurant.

766
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,260
-A restaurant?
-There are no evil spirits

767
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,970
in this tiny country town!

768
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,639
I just stepped on one. Turn around.

769
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,182
-Make a U-turn!
-Gosh, you.

770
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,059
-Goodness!
-You and your mouth.

771
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,687
-Oh, boy.
-Damn it!

772
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,365
-Coming through.
-My gosh.

773
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,491
What happened?

774
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,534
My goodness.

775
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,544
The victims are his mother and sister.

776
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,254
They're not critically injured.

777
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,297
I heard he has a lot of gambling debt,

778
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,134
but still… How could he do that
to his mom and sister?

779
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,805
Where am I now?

780
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,600
-Who are you?
-You bastard.

781
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,853
Are you on something?

782
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,897
Was it another anonymous tip?

783
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,609
Yes, sir. Someone called and asked us
to take away this jerk.

784
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,862
Gosh, I wonder who it is though.

785
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,656
Anonymous tips have been pouring in
across the country.

786
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,784
Here.

787
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,746
This is tiring but rewarding
at the same time.

788
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:31,956
I'm exhausted.

789
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:33,916
Where to next?

790
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,959
Jeju Island?

791
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,044
-Are you excited?
-Yes.

792
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,254
He's so hyped up now.

793
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,968
My gosh, the moon's so bright tonight.

794
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,303
This feels like a vacation.

795
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,930
Look at us chilling
and enjoying delicious food together

796
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,600
whenever we have some time.
I'd say we're on vacation now.

797
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,518
-I'll do it.
-Hold on, Mun.

798
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,479
-What?
-Everything in its own time.

799
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,898
I don't grill meat for just anyone.

800
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,442
But it smells so delicious.
I want one now.

801
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,277
-Doesn't it smell amazing?
-My gosh!

802
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,488
Mo-tak, I didn't know
you had a skill like that.

803
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:06,407
I used to grill a lot of meat
when I was a rookie cop.

804
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,408
Look at you!

805
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,369
Don't you think it'll rain soon?
We should go inside.

806
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,121
-Come on.
-Don't be such a spoilsport.

807
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
All right, it's ready!

808
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,665
-My gosh.
-I want meat.

809
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,125
-Here you go.
-Let's eat.

810
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,252
-Doesn't it look good?
-Oh, my.

811
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,087
-My gosh.
-This one too.

812
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,799
-All right, let's go.
-Let's eat! Here you go.

813
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,719
My gosh, we can't even find
a proper restaurant here.

814
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,055
This is our first feast in a long time.

815
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,849
This is amazing. My gosh.

816
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,727
This is bringing back some old memories.

817
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,605
You know, back in my day…

818
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,149
Back when I was a detective,

819
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:45,112
whenever I opened my mouth
to eat something,

820
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,240
the suspect would show up--

821
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,324
-Hold on.
-What?

822
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,786
-Damn it, Mo-tak! Why? Just why?
-Did you have to say that?

823
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,412
Did you spot one? For real?

824
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,082
No, just hold on.

825
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,167
-It's not an evil spirit.
-What's going on?

826
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,128
Hey, what is it? What's going on?

827
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,225
-Sir!
-What brings you here?

828
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,393
You didn't even call.

829
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:18,396
Long time no see, Ms. Chu.

830
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,565
Did you come all the way here
to see Ms. Chu?

831
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,901
No, that's not why I'm here.

832
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,904
I came to take care
of an urgent complaint.

833
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,114
-Mun.
-Yes?

834
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,284
I heard you're too embarrassed to work
because you have to wear

835
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,411
that red tracksuit every day.
You also said

836
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,747
you want to quit your job as a Counter
because it looks so lame.

837
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,832
-What?
-What?

838
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,083
-Me?
-Yes.

839
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,919
-Hey, Mun.
-Mo-tak! I bet it was you!

840
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,547
-Mo-tak said that.
-Gosh, seriously.

841
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,756
I knew it.

842
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,510
I guessed it might be Mo-tak's prank.

843
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,347
All right. Let's get started!

844
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,600
-Start what?
-What is that?

845
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,601
-My gosh.
-Wow.

846
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,562
-Who are they?
-What's going on?

847
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,814
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

848
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,859
What is going on?

849
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,110
-Go look.
-Wow.

850
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,904
-What is this?
-Hop in.

851
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,033
What is this?

852
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:15,411
It's a system that allows you
to select the fabric and design you want.

853
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,372
My gosh.

854
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,208
-Oh, sure.
-My gosh.

855
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,046
Sorry, just a moment.

856
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,882
-Gosh, that tickles.
-Like this?

857
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,508
-Okay, let's try that again.
-What?

858
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,719
-Did you say 126?
-All right.

859
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,055
Measure properly!

860
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,890
The waist? Okay.

861
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,516
A little longer. That's it.

862
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,143
-Nice, thank you.
-Thank you.

863
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,728
-Gosh.
-Oh, no. What do I do?

864
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,563
Don't worry. We'll take care of that.

865
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:58,371
Who are those punks?

866
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,372
No idea.

867
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,124
Those persistent jerks.
They keep following us.

868
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,918
Damn it. Let's just fight.

869
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,878
Maybe they're just losers.

870
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,004
-Damn it.
-Shit.

871
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,673
I like that attitude.

872
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,481
That bold, go-getter attitude.

873
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,693
Although you'll regret saying that
right away.

874
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,738
All four of them?

875
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,448
Yes, all of them.

876
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,701
Is roaming around in groups

877
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,703
the latest trend among evil spirits now?

878
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,329
Who are you guys?

879
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,165
Jeez, there's a kid.

880
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,333
Are you a family?

881
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,881
No, we're not.

882
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,509
Shut up, kiddo.

883
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:54,885
You little…

884
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,072
Did that taste good, you bastards!

885
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,381
Take that!

886
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:44,101
You bastard!

887
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,487
You punks!

888
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,614
What's wrong with being young?

889
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:08,375
Gosh…

890
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:43,577
Who are you people?

891
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,537
We're…

892
01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:48,499
We sell noodles and catch evil spirits.

893
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,336
We're the Uncanny Counters.

894
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:26,096
