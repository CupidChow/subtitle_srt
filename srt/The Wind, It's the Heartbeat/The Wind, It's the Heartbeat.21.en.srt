1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,960
Yes, what I said is true.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
Xingmeng strives for the truth.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,560
We don't want to hide it anymore.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,200
Yes.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,000
I believe Xu Qin can definitely surpass Tong Xin.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,640
Okay, I won't say anything more.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,760
Goodbye.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
You came just in time.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,720
You should still be the one to manage Xu Qin.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,120
The press conference is about to start.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,400
I won't manage Xu Qin.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,660
How can you face Xin Xin after doing this?

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,960
I've done enough for her.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,560
All these years, she's caused us so much trouble.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,280
The company doesn't depend on her.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,160
She doesn't follow instructions.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,080
Why can't I replace her with someone more obedient?

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,920
So you resort to these dirty tactics

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,850
against Xin Xin.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,080
After knowing you for so long,

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,200
I never thought

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,800
you would be such a despicable person.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
What do you know?

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm doing this for the company's development.

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,920
For a company to progress, you need to know what to keep and what to let go.

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Tong Xin only attracts negative attention.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,440
And she can no longer

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,920
bring profits to the company.

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
What's wrong with me letting her go?

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,120
Besides,

31
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,600
you're a Xingmeng agent.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,130
You must follow the company's arrangements.

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm no longer with Xingmeng.

34
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,600
What do you mean?

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,120
You've abandoned Xin Xin,

36
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,160
but I haven't.

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,600
I suggest you think carefully.

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Tong Xin's reputation is already ruined,

39
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,280
and the industry will soon blacklist her.

40
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,320
As an agent,

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
you should know

42
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,880
an artist with no future

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
has absolutely no value.

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,160
I've thought it through clearly.

45
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,120
I hope you're the one who won't regret this.

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,680
We'll see about that.

47
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,120
Hello to all our media friends.

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Today I've officially signed with Xingmeng Entertainment.

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,640
From now on,

50
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,570
I hope for your continued support.

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,120
Hello everyone.

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Xingmeng Entertainment is fully supporting Xu Qin's creative work.

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,760
We believe that in the near future,

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,320
there will be more exciting works

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,650
to share with all of you.

56
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
Will Xu Qin's future work only involve songwriting?

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,160
May I ask about your company's plans

58
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,320
for Xu Qin's future development?

59
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,520
Will she pursue acting?

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,760
About what happened at the fan meeting...

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,960
Xu Qin, do you have anything to explain?

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
Xu Qin, do you know where Tong Xin has gone?

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,560
Since the fan meeting,

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,620
she hasn't appeared in public at all.

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,240
I don't know where she went either.

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Because we still have many issues to resolve.

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,200
So I really want to know where she went too.

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
But she's always been like this,

69
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,520
doing whatever she wants.

70
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,360
But one day when she decides to come out,

71
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,880
we'll see her again.

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,200
The issue you mentioned hasn't been resolved.

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,720
Are you referring to Tongxin plagiarizing and bullying you?

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,760
Have you ever thought about

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,020
making Tongxin apologize for hurting you all these years?

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,440
Tongxin is very stubborn.

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,520
She won't apologize to me.

78
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,280
But it's been so long since all this happened.

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
I've moved on already.

80
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,440
So I don't need her apology either.

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,160
You don't need my apology?

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,360
But I need your apology.

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,650
What are you doing here?

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,720
Why am I here?

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,380
Shouldn't you know very well?

86
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm here to clarify the truth.

87
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,100
And expose who you really are.

88
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,880
Didn't you accuse me of plagiarism?

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,720
Nowhere left to go,

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,240
ruins everywhere.

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,720
All recorded memories are about you.

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,640
I wrote this song when I was in my second year of high school.

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,959
I left to go home and find evidence

94
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,400
to prove my innocence.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,880
You said I plagiarized,

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,480
but why is the date you created this song

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,760
actually after mine?

98
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,760
Is this video real?

99
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
So Xu Qin lied.

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
She's slandering Tong Xin.

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
This is so shameless.

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,480
She's like a thief crying 'catch the thief.'

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Turning the tables on others.

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,440
What about you bullying me?

105
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
That's actually true.

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
I apologize to you.

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,159
My mother has passed away.

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,040
My father is the only family I have left.

109
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,800
I really need this money for his medical treatment.

110
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Back then, you falsely accused me of bullying you out of jealousy.

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,920
I never thought after all these years,

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
you haven't changed one bit.

113
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
Now the evidence is conclusive.

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,920
You're not still going to deny it, are you?

115
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,200
Xu Qin, do you have anything to say?

116
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Is what Tong Xin said true?

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,080
Have you been slandering and defaming her all along?

118
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,610
Is your father really sick?

119
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,250
Or is that just an excuse to gain sympathy?

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,880
Explain yourself.

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,120
That's right. Tell us.

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,600
Is your father sick?

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
Tell the truth.

124
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Is everything you said true?

125
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
Is it all true?

126
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,640
What's really going on?

127
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
Why are you slandering her?

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,250
Who's behind this? Who put you up to it?

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Cheers! Cheers!

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880
Look at that.

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,920
That was truly satisfying.

132
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,240
I don't know if you saw it.

133
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,760
But when that video came out,

134
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,040
Xu Qin's face turned pale,

135
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,200
And as for Xie Dayu,

136
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
He turned and ran away.

137
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,170
Obviously a coward.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
I really have to thank you this time

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
for restoring the video.

140
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,960
Otherwise we wouldn't have gotten the evidence.

141
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,360
I never thought someone who plays games all day

142
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
would have such skills.

143
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
You underestimated me.

144
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm a top graduate from DMT.

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,280
Video restoration is my specialty.

146
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,080
You thought I was just a gaming coach?

147
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,400
That's my brother.

148
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,240
Xinxin, you disappeared without saying a word.

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Everyone is worried about you.

150
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Yes.

151
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,680
You should have told me about this earlier.

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,200
Haven't I always been here?

153
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,480
I know.

154
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,200
I was too stubborn last time.

155
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,360
Made you all worry.

156
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,040
Actually, I was fine then.

157
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,480
My mind was just a bit confused.

158
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
I needed some time alone.

159
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,380
Besides, I still had Jiang Yinchuan with me.

160
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Don't worry everyone.

161
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,280
I'll definitely take good care of Xinxin.

162
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
He is actually quite reliable.

163
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,120
That video of me singing in high school

164
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
was found in his camera.

165
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,100
It's important evidence proving I didn't plagiarize.

166
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,730
Open your mouth.

167
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
No need, Xuanze.

168
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,320
I have my own servant.

169
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,840
Look at how lovey-dovey you two are.

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,159
Are you really going to be my sister-in-law?

171
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,560
It's too early for you to call me sister-in-law.

173
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
That's not completely nonsense.

174
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,040
I, your brother,

175
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,120
I'll soon officially

176
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,780
make her your sister-in-law.

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,640
Xinxin.

178
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,240
I was wrong before.

179
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,440
I always prioritized the company's interests

180
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,040
without considering your feelings.

181
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,200
Don't say that.

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,480
I know everything you've done.

183
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
It was all for my own good.

184
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,920
I haven't been an obedient artist.

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,980
I've given you plenty to worry about.

186
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,840
I should apologize to you for this.

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,360
Worrying about artists is my job.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
You don't need to apologize.

189
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,400
It's me who

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,160
didn't notice the problems with Xie Dayu.

191
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,040
They were the ones causing trouble.

192
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,640
It has nothing to do with you.

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,039
I heard you resigned from Xingmeng.

194
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
Would you like to help me?

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,940
Help you with what?

196
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,880
Help me establish my own music studio.

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
I've already thought of a name.

198
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,159
It's called 'Chuxin',

199
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,120
to remind me to pursue my dreams

200
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,380
and never forget my original intention.

201
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
You should have gone independent long ago.

202
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,520
If you have any financial issues, just let me know.

203
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,240
No need, sis. After all these years of hard work,

204
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,600
I've saved up enough.

205
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,520
Just wait for my success story.

206
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,840
You can also collaborate with my studio.

207
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,600
Let's release songs together for mutual benefit.

208
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,060
That goes without saying.

209
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm looking forward to releasing songs together.

210
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
Awesome. Let's do it.

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,160
Don't just sit there. Come on,

212
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,080
let's have a drink too.

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's all drink together.

214
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,880
Let's toast to the success of Xinxin's studio.

215
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,920
Come on, cheers!

216
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
Cheers.

217
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,680
Anan, tomorrow is the final competition.

218
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,080
I'm planning to formally introduce our duo on stage.

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,320
That song was created by both of us.

220
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Even if you're not there,

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,960
this stage and this honor

222
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
belong to both of us.

223
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
Anan,

224
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,480
where are you now?

225
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,340
Is your treatment going well?

226
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,360
Today is your birthday.

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,040
I've prepared gifts and a cake for you.

228
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,800
I wonder what your wish would be.

229
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,760
Anan, my new album has been well received.

230
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,960
The lead track is definitely in the style you like.

231
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
I miss you so much.

232
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,640
The new recording studio is spacious.

233
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,640
It would be amazing if we could record songs together.

234
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,520
So Xinxin has never forgotten our friendship.

235
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm sorry. I want to see you.

236
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Xinxin, where are you going?

237
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,560
I'm going out for a bit. I'll be back soon.

238
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,440
Do you want me to come with you?

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
No, no need.

240
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,280
Anan.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,720
I found that phone.

242
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
And I saw all those messages you sent me.

243
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,880
After your accident,

244
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,360
I tried every way to contact you,

245
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,040
but I never got any response.

246
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
I thought

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
you would never use that phone number again

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,930
and would never see those messages I sent you.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,040
That video of you singing by the sea,

250
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,940
I've watched it so many times.

251
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,680
I've listened to that song countless times too.

252
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
After all these years,

253
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,760
I even forgot

254
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
that song was written about us.

255
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
We were so close back then.

256
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
I never imagined

257
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
that one day we would end up like this.

258
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,440
Life is full of unexpected changes.

259
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Even I never thought

260
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,560
you would bounce back again.

261
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,360
You truly are that resilient Tongxin.

262
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,000
I always thought

263
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,960
that car accident destroyed me,

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
but thinking about it now,

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,000
if you had been the one injured,

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,880
you definitely wouldn't have been like me,

267
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
so easily defeated by hardship.

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Xinxin,

269
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
do you regret knowing me?

270
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,480
No, I don't.

271
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,810
We've known each other since we were five.

272
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
We went to the same kindergarten,

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,760
elementary school, middle school, high school.

274
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,800
For all these years,

275
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
we've never been apart.

276
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,320
We've shared so many wonderful,

277
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,140
happy memories together.

278
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,760
Even if I could start over,

279
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,520
I would still choose to be your friend.

280
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,520
Jiang Yinchuan told me

281
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,930
that my feelings for him weren't love.

282
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,680
I refused to accept it,

283
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,860
but thinking about it now,

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,920
he might have been right.

285
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,760
We grew up together,

286
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,920
I was always your best friend.

287
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,720
But ever since he appeared,

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,280
my ranking in your heart dropped.

289
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,740
He doesn't deserve you at all.

290
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,880
How dare he take my place?

291
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,930
After the accident,

292
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,440
you kept moving upward,

293
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,200
while I kept sinking lower.

294
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The two of us

295
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,680
are completely from different worlds now.

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,240
I can't accept it!

297
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,160
Actually, you did nothing wrong.

298
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,400
I wrongly blamed you.

299
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,240
It was me.

300
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,360
I refused to accept reality

301
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,760
and trapped myself in place.

302
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,280
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
It's all my fault.

304
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
I moved forward too quickly,

305
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,080
focusing only on work

306
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,680
and ignoring your feelings.

307
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,560
Anan,

308
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm about to establish

309
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,560
my own music studio.

310
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,560
If you're willing,

311
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,800
we can still be like before,

312
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,890
releasing songs together.

313
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,440
What do you say?

314
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,300
Please don't rush to withdraw your investment.

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,320
The issue with Xu Qin is just a misunderstanding.

316
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,520
Our company is already handling the PR.

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,040
Everything will be fine.

318
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,160
I promise you.

319
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Hello?

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Xinxin, you're here.

321
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
Please sit down.

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,200
Let me make you some tea, Xinxin.

323
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
No need.

324
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,120
I'm here today to terminate my contract.

325
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,520
I'll leave as soon as the paperwork is done.

326
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,640
Why are you terminating the contract, Xinxin?

327
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,700
This is all just a misunderstanding.

328
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,840
I was also deceived by Xu Qin and her people.

329
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,320
I know I was wrong.

330
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
For the sake of our years of friendship,

331
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,960
please don't terminate the contract.

332
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,440
Our company needs you.

333
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,280
Whether you agree or not,

334
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,080
I'm terminating this contract.

335
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Fine, you want to terminate?

336
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,760
Let me tell you,

337
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,400
the penalty fee isn't small.

338
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,480
Don't worry,

339
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
I'll pay every penny of the penalty.

340
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
Even if you're willing to spend this money,

341
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,640
are you willing to risk your reputation?

342
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,100
Aren't you afraid I'll expose your secrets?

343
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,220
What secrets do I have?

344
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,800
Like your family background.

345
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
Haven't you always told your fans

346
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,960
that you'd be honest with them?

347
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,560
But you've been hiding the truth.

348
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
If they find out you're a fraud,

349
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,130
do you think they'll stop being your fans?

350
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
No need for you to expose anything.

351
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,780
I'll tell them myself.

352
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
Tongxin.

353
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,840
Go to hell.

354
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,380
Juexian Eryan.

355
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,210
Wei Yanfeng.

356
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,520
Ziran.

357
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,440
Understood.

358
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,360
Ziran.
