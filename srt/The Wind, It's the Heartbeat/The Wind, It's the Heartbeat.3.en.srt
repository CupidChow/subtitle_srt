1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,920
Come in. Hurry.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,880
Sit here.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,240
Jiang Yinchuan.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,320
Am I dreaming?

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,600
Where have you been these days?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,200
I couldn't find you for days.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,340
Put your hand down, child.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,360
There was a fire at Uncle Jiang's house.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,480
Xiao Jiang's mother is injured and in the hospital.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,400
The house is too damaged to live in.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,760
Xiao Jiang will stay with us for a while.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,600
You need to take good care of him.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,080
Don't throw childish tantrums.

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,140
Do you understand?

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,720
How did this happen?

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,800
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
Don't worry. Your mother will be blessed with good fortune.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,880
She'll recover soon.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,280
Xiao Jiang, your room is

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,600
on the same floor as Xinxin's. Let her show you.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,960
Make yourself at home.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Don't be shy.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,320
Thank you, auntie.

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
Let's go. Follow me.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,450
Your room gets such nice sunlight.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,880
I took your mom to First Hospital today.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,480
I've been busy getting her settled until now.

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,880
The hospital room is a bit bigger this time.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,360
Do we have enough money for the medical expenses?

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,920
Don't worry about it. It's enough.

31
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,600
Dad has already paid for everything.

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,480
It's not that much more expensive anyway.

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,210
I know our family's situation.

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
If there's not enough money for medical expenses,

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,560
I can figure something out too.

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Xiaochuan,

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,680
don't worry about your mom.

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
Dad's here to handle it.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,840
Your only job is to study hard.

40
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,000
Also, recently,

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,360
while you're staying at the Tong family's house,

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,039
you need to be considerate.

43
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't keep causing them trouble.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Mm, I understand.

45
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,970
Jiang Yinchuan.

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,440
I failed my exam this time.

47
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,840
Can you tutor me?

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,680
Don't be so quick to refuse.

49
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Senior Jiang, I know you're busy,

50
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,040
but I have two reasons why you must tutor me.

51
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,199
First, my grades are terrible.

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,160
Only the top student is qualified to teach me.

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
Second, I'll pay you generously.

54
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,360
Only the top student deserves such payment.

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
You're lying.

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,000
Why would I lie to you?

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,060
I can pay three times the market rate.

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,490
Don't believe me? I'll transfer the tutoring fee right now.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
You clearly know how to solve these problems,

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
but you only completed half of them.

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,600
In other words,

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
you failed on purpose.

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't need your sympathy,

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,260
and I certainly don't need your help.

65
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,560
Even if I passed, how many points would I get?

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Besides, who said I want to help you?

67
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,600
Aren't you the one tutoring me?

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
My parents have already agreed.

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,800
Just say yes, Mr. Jiang.

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,000
Sis.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What took you so long?

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
I overslept.

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Let's go.

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,360
Wait here for a moment.

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,480
This is Sun Fan.

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,210
He's the company's new signee.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Xinxin.

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Quickly get to know your boyfriend.

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
Xinxin.

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,690
I have no obligation to mentor newcomers.

81
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
It's killing two birds with one stone.

82
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
At the press conference later,

83
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
you'll say that

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,210
Sun Fan is your wealthy boyfriend you've been dating for years.

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Get to know each other first.

86
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,370
I need you to make it look real in front of the cameras.

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Xinxin.

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,740
Let me tell you something.

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
Those fans out there have really sharp eyes.

90
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,610
They can spot a real couple at a glance.

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,640
We need to work hard on showing our chemistry.

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,839
Make it convincing.

93
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,920
Later, when we go out,

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,480
we need to first...

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,200
We must pay attention to details too.

96
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,600
When answering reporters' questions later,

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
you can lean on my shoulder.

98
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,280
Then we'll have a kiss

99
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,320
for a perfect ending.

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,400
Xinxin! Xinxin!

101
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Hey, where's her boyfriend?

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,560
This troublemaker is up to something again.

103
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,320
Tong Xin, how would you explain

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,960
the recent rumors about your infidelity?

105
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,280
After these rumors surfaced,

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,520
will they affect your upcoming concert?

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,160
Xinxin,

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
weren't you going to make an official announcement today?

109
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Why are you alone?

110
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Can you reveal your boyfriend's profession?

111
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,740
Will he make an appearance today?

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
I

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,610
don't have a boyfriend.

114
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,480
If you can't control your hands and feet,

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,080
then get the hell out of here.

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
Even though it's fake,

117
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,220
we still need to interact like a real couple.

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,960
If we're going to act,

119
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,800
we need to be professional

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,920
and stay in character.

121
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,960
Or is it that

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,080
you're afraid your sugar daddy will find out and get upset?

123
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,120
What sugar daddy?

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,480
Stop pretending.

125
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,000
We both know what's going on.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,840
I'm here

127
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,770
to provide cover for you and your sugar daddy.

128
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,400
I didn't expect you to be so promiscuous.

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,680
Women,

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,720
they're all the same.

131
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Before I tear your mouth apart,

132
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,560
get out now.

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,450
[Frantically hitting]

134
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Star Dream claims you already have a boyfriend.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Who's lying, you or the company?

136
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,240
Are you going to admit to being the other woman?

137
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,440
Will you reveal the businessman's identity today?

138
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,840
Are you using pregnancy to force a commitment?

139
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,700
How many months pregnant are you?

140
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
Actually, that person...

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,800
is me.

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,860
She really doesn't have a boyfriend.

143
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,080
I'm sorry

144
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,300
for being late.

145
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,800
Hello everyone.

146
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,580
My name is Jiang Yinchuan.

147
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,600
I am Xinxin's

148
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,840
fiancé.

149
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Jiang Yinchuan.

150
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
I like you.

151
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
You're being

152
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
so cheap.

153
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,920
It's Jiang Yinchuan,

154
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,280
that genius doctor.

155
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,140
He's actually Tong Xin's fiancé.

156
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,159
Jiang Yinchuan, what are you doing?

157
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,730
If you want to get through this crisis,

158
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
just play along with me.

159
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,040
Xinxin, is he really your fiancé?

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
He's not lying, is he?

161
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
He is indeed mine.

162
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,320
Fiancé.

163
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,640
Okay.

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Bless Xinxin.

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,800
Bless Xinxin.

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,480
Jiang Yinchuan, what's wrong with you?

167
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,460
Based on your previous symptoms,

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,440
I found a friend who understands psychology for you.

169
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
Here's his profile.

170
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
Don't change the subject.

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm asking you

172
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
why you pretended to be my fiancé.

173
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,820
Since you need someone to play along anyway,

174
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,320
why can't that person be me?

175
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,760
You have the nerve to ask.

176
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,600
It could be anyone,

177
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
but never you.

178
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
I think I know your plan.

179
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
From any perspective,

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
I am the most suitable candidate right now.

181
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,200
You probably don't want others to know about your condition, right?

182
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,280
I'm a doctor.

183
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,040
This way, when you seek medical treatment,

184
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,840
no one will be suspicious.

185
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,480
Also,

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,360
I promise you

187
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,690
I'll definitely keep your secret.

188
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,330
Jiang Yinchuan,

189
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,600
since when did you become so kind?

190
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,480
Did I lose my memory,

191
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,760
or did you forget?

192
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,280
The person who publicly humiliated me back then

193
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,840
was you, wasn't it?

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,730
Even if I, Tong Xin, am looking for a fake husband,

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
I still have standards.

196
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,840
I can agree to anything you want.

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Really?

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,560
What if I ask you to kneel?

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,000
Jiang Yinchuan,

200
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,040
kiss me.

201
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,920
Do you dare?

202
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,480
Tong Xin makes a stunning announcement.

203
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,120
Officially revealing her fiancé.

204
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,240
Their secret relationship has progressed rapidly,

205
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,120
with a wedding planned soon.

206
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,080
Xin Xin, honestly,

207
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,840
since you already had someone you liked,

208
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
you should have told us earlier.

209
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,280
That's right. Compared to Sun Fan,

210
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,320
Dr. Jiang is much better for you.

211
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
But our strategy worked perfectly.

212
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,760
Who even remembers that mess from before?

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
However,

214
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
we should thank Dr. Jiang for his help.

215
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,920
Hmph. Who asked for his help?

216
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,240
Poking his nose where it doesn't belong.

217
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
At this point,

218
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,800
whether you accept it or not,

219
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,680
Dr. Jiang is your fiancé.

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, exactly.

221
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,760
You two need to play your parts completely.

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,160
Don't let anyone spot any flaws in your act.

223
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,560
You should live together.

224
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,620
Dr. Jiang has already agreed to this.

225
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,760
Why should his agreement matter?

226
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,360
I don't want some stranger moving into my home.

227
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Listen here,

228
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,960
there are so many eyes watching you now.

229
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,020
Try to understand the situation.

230
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,740
Isn't this your former storage room?

231
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,920
You're making Dr. Jiang, a grown man, live here?

232
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,720
This is my house.

233
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,880
Of course I make the decisions.

234
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,800
He insisted on living here.

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
Let me be clear upfront.

236
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,840
Based on the principle that I can't stand you,

237
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,160
Your activity area

238
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,490
is limited to your room and bathroom only.

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,440
And your appearance times

240
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,680
must not overlap with my living schedule at all.

241
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
In other words,

242
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,360
whenever I'm present,

243
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,240
You can't appear in front of me.

244
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,540
We're living under the same roof,

245
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
how can I avoid you?

246
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,000
That's your problem.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Can't do it? Then leave.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Fine.

249
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,440
It's your territory.

250
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,760
I'll do as you say.

251
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,140
Sorry for the inconvenience, Dr. Jiang.

252
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,760
Dr. Jiang, a real man

253
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,020
knows when to bend and when to stand firm.

254
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,020
You don't need to pick me up next time.

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,800
It's on my way.

256
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,160
Your hospital is in the west part of the city.

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm in the east.

258
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
How is that on your way?

259
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,720
Yue asked me to come.

260
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,040
It's a sensitive time right now.

261
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
Better to be cautious.

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,160
What a hassle.

263
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,840
What are you two doing?

264
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,480
Lin Bufan.

265
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Why are you here?

266
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,880
It's a long story.

267
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,610
Wei Yanfeng.

268
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,280
Ziran.

269
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,440
Ziran.

270
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:31,920
Keding Penghui.

271
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,280
Keyu Penghui.

272
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,360
Keke Penghui.
