1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,640
This male lead is so cute.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,300
His smile is like a little sun.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,520
What little sun?

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,760
Always laughing and joking around.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,120
Childish.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,640
What?

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,360
You prefer those serious-faced guys?

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,720
That's called mature and steady.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm not serious-faced.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,320
Why are you blushing?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,530
Don't tell me you like someone.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,760
Who is it? How come I don't know?

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,480
His name is Jiang Yinchuan.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,200
He's also from our school.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,240
Jiang Yinchuan.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,840
I just saw the news online.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
How is Xinxin?

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,000
Why aren't you answering my calls?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
Xinxin is missing.

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,650
What exactly happened?

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,580
We were just having a fan meeting.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,360
Then suddenly Xu Qin got on stage.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,760
She accused Xinxin of bullying her and plagiarizing her songs.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
I saw the situation was chaotic,

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,460
so I told Xinxin to wait in the break room.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,210
But when I went back to find her,

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,479
she was gone.

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
I've looked everywhere,

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,820
she's nowhere to be found.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,280
If Xinxin gets desperate

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,140
will something bad happen to her?

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,280
We've searched everywhere possible

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,340
but found nothing.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,740
Then let's split up and search again.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Baiyang Security

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,280
Hey, where is she?

37
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,840
How would I know?

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,400
You watched her leave

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
and now you're asking me?

40
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,320
I thought she was investigating the truth

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,380
and you'd have someone watching her.

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,340
She can go wherever she wants.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm not her mother.

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,140
Haven't you found the person yet?

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,440
Okay, I got it.

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you here?

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,480
Move over. I'll drive.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,170
What are you staring at?

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,420
Let me make this clear.

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,360
I'm not here to help you find your sister.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,890
I'm here to help my brother find a girlfriend.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,880
Hurry up.

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,120
Xinxin.

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,720
Thank you.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,680
An'an.

56
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,040
I heard you transferred Jiang Yinchuan's mother

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,240
to your family hospital for treatment.

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,920
Didn't you dislike him before?

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,380
Why the sudden change?

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,040
Although he's not very likable,

61
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,280
his mother has gone through something serious,

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,000
which is truly pitiful.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm just showing kindness and helping others.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Xinxin,

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,720
you must

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
also want his mother to get the best treatment, right?

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
Of course.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm glad his mother can get proper treatment.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,210
I'm happy for their family.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
That's what I thought.

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,040
You like Jiang Yinchuan so much,

72
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,500
so helping him is like helping you, isn't it?

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Xinxin,

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,440
actually, I've been thinking,

75
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,320
I didn't want you two together before

76
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,200
because I felt the gap between you was too big.

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,000
I was afraid you'd suffer for love.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
But lately I've seen you pursuing Jiang Yinchuan,

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
I've noticed all your pain, hesitation and struggle.

80
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
If you really can't let go of these feelings,

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,600
why not be brave

82
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
and confess to him?

83
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,360
If he agrees to be with you,

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,080
it would give

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
a perfect ending to these feelings.

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,680
If he doesn't agree,

87
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,480
at least you can put this matter behind you.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,720
Even without romance,

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,800
your life will still be colorful.

90
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,080
Just let yourself go

91
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,400
and put a period to these feelings.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
We grew up together.

93
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,490
After sharing so many beautiful memories together,

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,440
I originally thought

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
we would be friends forever.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,720
I, Tong Xin,

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
wanted to be lifelong friends with An Ning.

98
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,920
Our friendship would last forever.

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,360
But who knew

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,920
that now we

101
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,480
have grown so far apart,

102
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,480
even becoming bitter enemies.

103
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,520
Xin Xin,

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,720
people who truly care about you and love you

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
won't drift away from you.

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,520
You still have us.

107
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
No matter what happens,

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,020
we will support you without hesitation.

109
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
The most important thing now

110
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,040
is to find favorable evidence

111
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
to prove your innocence.

112
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,800
When I discovered Xu Qin was lip-syncing before

113
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,730
and she begged for my forgiveness,

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,730
I recorded her voice and got the surveillance video.

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,120
If I release the video,

116
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,480
everyone will know she's slandering me.

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
What's wrong?

118
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,640
The evidence is gone.

119
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,080
Was it deleted by someone?

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,160
Think about it.

121
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,320
Has anyone touched your phone?

122
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,520
I carry my phone with me every day.

123
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,640
Logically, no one should have touched my phone.

124
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,880
Nothing is absolute.

125
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,419
If they want to delete your stuff,

126
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,800
they'll definitely make their move when you're not paying attention.

127
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,860
About this matter,

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,920
besides me and Xu Qin,

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,240
only Song Yue and Xie Dayu know about it.

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I've already recorded everything.

131
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,160
If this happens again,

132
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,760
don't blame me for releasing the recording.

133
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
And as for you all,

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,960
if there's a next time, I'll terminate your contract immediately.

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
Okay.

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,860
It must be Xie Dayu and Xu Qin behind this.

137
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
To accuse me of lip-syncing,

138
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,460
they had to delete the evidence from my phone first.

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,640
But how did they manage to do it?

140
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,440
How they did it doesn't matter anymore.

141
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,520
What's most important now is how to recover

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,730
what they deleted from your phone.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
How can we recover it?

144
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
I know someone.

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,640
Lin Bufan.

146
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
He's good at this.

147
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Xinxin.

148
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,940
I have something else to show you.

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,460
We've been hungry all day.

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,890
Drink something hot to fill your stomach.

151
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,080
Thanks.

152
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,320
Xinxin has finally been found.

153
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
I told you.

154
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,880
My brother is still quite smart.

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,800
That's a relief.

156
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
Since my brother has found Tongxin,

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,480
he'll definitely take good care of her.

158
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,400
Thank you for today.

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
You've been tired all day too.

160
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,200
Let me take you home.

161
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Get in the car.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,860
Come on, get in.

163
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,120
I won't.

164
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,440
We've broken up.

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,320
A single man and woman walking each other home late at night

166
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,520
is quite suggestive.

167
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,960
You should be careful

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,620
not to give people the wrong idea.

169
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
It's so late there aren't even any taxis around.

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,220
How do you plan to get back?

171
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Shared bike.

172
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,080
Your current achievements and status,

173
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,040
all those fans and lovers surrounding you,

174
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,880
should have been mine.

175
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,440
If you truly consider me your friend.

176
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,400
You won't take away my life.

177
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Haven't you ruined me enough?

178
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,520
Now you want to ruin Jiang Yinchuan too?

179
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,120
You're nothing but bad luck.

180
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,820
Anyone who gets involved with you will suffer sooner or later.

181
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,560
Xinxin.

182
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
Are you okay?

183
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,690
Jiang Yinchuan.

184
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,640
Am I really a harbinger of misfortune?

185
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
I only bring pain to others.

186
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,120
Why does everything in my life

187
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,560
go against what I hope for?

188
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,800
Did I do something wrong

189
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,160
that heaven is punishing me like this?

190
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,260
You haven't done anything wrong.

191
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
Don't put all the blame

192
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
on yourself.

193
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
If you insist on taking

194
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
all the blame upon yourself,

195
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
you're only making those who hurt you more satisfied.

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,800
Let me show you something.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
There should be quite a few recordings in here,

198
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,540
videos of you singing from back then.

199
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Before I met you,

200
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,130
I was already using this camera

201
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
to document my life.

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,160
But looking back now,

203
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,200
most of what's recorded

204
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,840
is footage of you.

205
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,880
Which means

206
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,600
my subconscious

207
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
had already subtly

208
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,760
made the choice for me.

209
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,320
Your mom won this in a lottery.

210
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,400
Xiaochuan, you can have it.

211
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,520
Thanks, Dad.

212
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Which button starts recording?

213
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,820
You'll have to figure that out yourself.

214
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,300
I'll look it up online.

215
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,140
Wen Wei Yan Feng

216
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,760
Ziran

217
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:03,970
Ziran

218
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:04,450
Ziran

219
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,160
