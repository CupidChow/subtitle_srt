1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,920
Look at you two every day,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,100
getting into trouble,

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,880
if this continues,

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,880
how can you face your parents who raised you?

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,170
You did something wrong

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,360
and you have the nerve

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,600
to smile about it.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
What kind of behavior is that?

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,280
We didn't do anything wrong, okay?

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,040
Tongxin never bullied Xu Qin.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
She was falsely accused.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,760
Besides,

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,720
I only hit them because they insulted us first.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,360
They provoked us first.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,760
So you did wrong and still think you're right?

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,240
Even if they were wrong,

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,280
you should have told the teacher first,

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,240
instead of using violence to solve problems.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,720
But I didn't bully her.

20
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,680
That's right.

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,920
Without evidence,

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,080
who would believe you?

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
In your eyes,

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm just that kind of person.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,410
What's going on?

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,240
Tongxin, did you hit someone?

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,480
I will investigate this matter thoroughly.

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,840
But both of you

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,120
must stand here for detention during this class period.

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Take this time to reflect on your actions.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,010
Don't resort to violence whenever you get angry.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,360
She didn't hit anyone.

33
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,520
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,600
I believe you.

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,039
Wait for me at the gate after school.

36
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,640
I'll take you to the beach to set off fireworks.

37
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm leaving now.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,039
See you at the gate after school.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,039
Jiang Yinchuan, stop right there!

40
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,840
I can accept others wrongly accusing me.

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,759
But between you and me,

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,160
don't we even have this little bit of trust?

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
Hello.

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,240
We interrupt with an announcement.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
Recently at our school,

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
there have been some rumors.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,640
Claiming that student Tong Xin bullied student Xu Qin.

48
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
After investigation by the school,

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,640
this matter has now been clarified.

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,320
Between these two students,

51
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,400
there was only a minor friction and misunderstanding.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,720
No bullying has occurred.

53
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
We hope all students

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,960
will focus your energy on studying.

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,320
Don't listen to rumors,

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,840
as they affect relationships between students.

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
I got the surveillance footage from the café owner

58
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,560
and have given it to the teacher.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
Jiang Yinchuan,

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,040
I knew you'd be on my side.

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,960
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,600
Today's incident has nothing to do with Tong Xin.

63
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,560
This misunderstanding

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,480
is all my fault.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,040
Could we have really wronged Tong Xin?

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,960
Not necessarily.

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,640
Money talks.

68
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,200
Tong Xin's family is so rich,

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
they probably paid someone off.

70
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,000
Why else would Xu Qin cry like that?

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
That's true.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,840
It seems

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,320
people still don't completely believe you.

74
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,600
Who cares about them?

75
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,720
I don't care what others think of me.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,640
As long as those close to me believe me, that's enough.

77
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's go home.

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,860
What are you doing?

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm taking her temperature.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,920
Don't touch her.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
We're home now.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
You can leave.

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,339
I want to stay and take care of her.

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,079
If you hadn't taken her out,

85
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
would she have a fever?

86
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,560
So this is all my fault.

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,280
That's why I should stay and take care of her.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,840
What you should do now is leave immediately.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
Who are you to her?

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,800
Is this your home?

91
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Who are you to say that?

92
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,240
What are you doing? Don't touch her!

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm a doctor.

94
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
I need to take her temperature.

95
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,159
Doctor my ass!

96
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,440
So noisy.

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,400
Mr. Jiang.

98
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,560
Why are you in my room?

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Xinxin.

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,880
You're sick.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,600
You'll feel better after some rest.

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,440
I did poorly on my math test again.

103
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,680
You taught me everything.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,320
But I forgot it all again.

105
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,600
Do you know what I was thinking during the exam?

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
I was thinking about

107
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,720
singing a song for you.

108
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,880
Would you like to hear it?

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,280
How can I let go

110
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
of someone like you?

111
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,440
There's no parking space.

112
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,920
I need to discuss some partnerships at the dinner.

113
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,440
It might take quite a while.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,840
Find somewhere to rest on your own.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,480
I'll let you know when it's over.

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,840
So what should I eat?

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,400
Keep the receipts and I'll reimburse you.

118
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,160
Really?

119
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,960
I can get reimbursed for anything I eat?

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,600
Then I want to eat...

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Australian premium lobster,

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Spanish Iberian ham,

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,640
Japanese Kobe Wagyu beef,

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,060
and Qingdao Laoshan oysters.

125
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,400
The limit is 50.

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,220
Anything over that comes out of your pocket.

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,400
So stingy.

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,520
Who's that?

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you even know how to drive?

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
If you hit or scratch it, you'll pay. It costs 30,000 each time.

131
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Shut up.

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
Open the window.

133
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,520
Mr. Tong, what a coincidence!

134
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,640
I saw you in the parking lot.

135
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,440
About our cooperation today,

136
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,160
let's have a good talk later.

137
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,800
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
I've brought all the business proposals.

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,930
We won't leave until we're drunk tonight.

140
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
Let them have this parking spot.

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Why should we?

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
We saw it first.

143
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

144
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,640
You park here. We'll find another spot.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,560
Why give it to them?

146
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
I found it first.

147
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
If you won't even give up a parking spot,

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,800
how can we expect them to give us

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,200
a discount on prices later?

150
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
Kids don't understand business.

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
Just drive the car properly.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,280
Where should we park then?

153
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,440
Are you the driver or am I? Why ask me?

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,320
Drop me off at the hotel lobby ahead,

155
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,240
then find a parking spot yourself.

156
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,500
I'm the driver but I still can't find one.

157
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
You promised to film that couple vlog yesterday.

158
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,640
Why didn't you show up?

159
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Dr. Jiang waited for you for ages.

160
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,160
I did go.

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
It's just...

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
What's wrong with you?

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm sick.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
I caught a fever from the cold wind.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh my goodness!

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,720
What drama is this now?

167
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,050
You really need to take care of your voice.

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,160
Alright, alright.

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,220
I'll stop nagging.

170
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
Get some good rest.

171
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,680
Let Dr. Jiang take good care of you.

172
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
Who said I need his care?

173
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,800
He had a fever last night.

174
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
Although the fever has gone down,

175
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
for safety reasons,

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
we still need to visit the hospital.

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,000
These are the medications the doctor prescribed for you.

178
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,060
Remember to take them as instructed.

179
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,880
What? Do you want a balloon too?

180
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,120
No.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,260
Really don't want one?

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
Childish.

183
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,560
You're all wet.

184
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,000
Why don't you go inside to take shelter?

185
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,720
It's too noisy in there.

186
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,320
I came out for some fresh air.

187
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,760
So, how are you doing?

188
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,480
Is the collaboration going well?

189
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,560
Not good. Not very smooth.

190
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,200
Why are you so late?

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,240
I was playing games and lost track of time.

192
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,400
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

193
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,180
I brought this for you.

194
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,720
Shall we go now?

195
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,440
Let's go.

196
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
Hi there.

197
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,760
I found a new café today.

198
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,600
The cakes here are so exquisite.

199
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Here.

200
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
Your phone

201
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,650
is quite an old model, isn't it?

202
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,880
It was a gift from a friend.

203
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,360
Although it's a bit old,

204
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,200
I can't bear to part with it,

205
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,520
so I keep using it.

206
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,120
So it seems what matters isn't the phone,

207
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,080
but the person who gave it to you.

208
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,420
She must be very important to you.

209
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,400
We used to be best friends.

210
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
But because of me,

211
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
she suffered a lot.

212
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,280
I lost touch with her after that.

213
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,780
I often dream about her

214
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,570
and want to make it up to her.

215
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,960
But I don't know what to do.

216
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,280
Don't worry,

217
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,200
we have plenty of time.

218
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,280
You can tell me

219
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,290
your story from the beginning.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
When we were in high school,

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
we were best friends.

222
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,720
Ziran.

223
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,760
Ziran.

224
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,480
Ziran.
