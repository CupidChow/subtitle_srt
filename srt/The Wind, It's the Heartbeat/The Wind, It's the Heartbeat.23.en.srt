1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
No need to listen anymore.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,800
Isn't this exactly the same as my 'Gravity of Heart'

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
?

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,640
They just changed the key.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,770
Even the lyrics are almost identical.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,160
This song went viral as soon as it was released.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,520
Everyone's giving it great reviews.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
Who stole my song and released it first?

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,880
From the company team to the recording studio staff,

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,400
many people had access to the new song.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,730
It's difficult to investigate right now.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,880
Now everyone has a preconceived notion

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,810
that we're the ones plagiarizing.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,920
Xinxin.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,400
I think no matter what,

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,680
getting caught in a public controversy isn't good.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,240
How about this? I'll write you a new song.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,320
What do you think?

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,560
No. I want this one.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,960
There's a long melody in the middle of this song

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,120
that I've been adjusting

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,680
and haven't finalized yet.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,080
We'll release 'Gravity of Heart' as planned.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,920
The truth will speak for itself in the end.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,289
Jiang Yinchuan.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,160
Do you doctors

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,240
have no interest in women?

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Theoretically speaking,

29
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,759
in a doctor's eyes,

30
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,479
gender isn't that important.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,320
So in your eyes,

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,759
I'm just a piece of flesh?

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,840
You're different, of course.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
We have feelings for each other.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,560
So I'm a piece of flesh with feelings.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
What are you

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,160
thinking about all day?

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,840
I was just thinking...

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Go to sleep.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,840
A bug just fell down

41
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,480
and it's crawling on you.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,680
What bug?

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,640
Looks like a small spider.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
The spider

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,320
must have run away already.

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,440
How about

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,560
we ask the housekeeper to clean up tomorrow?

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,520
That won't do.

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
What if it's a poisonous spider?

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,200
No, I need to catch it.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,000
Where did it go?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,730
It didn't crawl inside, did it?

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,320
Let me see where it is.

54
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Is it here?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,920
Tong Xin.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
That little spider you mentioned

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
is actually you, isn't it?

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
Do you know

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,620
provoking me like this

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,520
is bad for your health?

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,600
Wait.

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,760
That little spider has already escaped.

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
I won't disturb your sleep.

64
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
Since the little spider is gone,

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
why don't you stay?

66
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
The new song leaked.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
This shouldn't have happened.

68
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,400
All staff who heard it

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
signed confidentiality agreements.

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,120
No one should take such a risk.

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
So I still have no clue.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,960
Actually, there's something

73
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,290
I've been hesitating whether to tell you.

74
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,000
What is it?

75
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,640
There's nothing we can't talk about.

76
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,560
The truth is, Xuanze now

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
is not the Xuanze you once knew.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,080
My collaboration with Xu Qin

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,560
was arranged by Xuanze.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,060
I know you don't want to believe this,

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
but the song leak

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
might very well be connected to him.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,500
The recording is gone.

84
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,880
Was it deleted by someone?

85
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,080
Think about it.

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,970
Has anyone touched your phone?

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,120
I twisted my ankle.

88
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
Can you come and check on me?

89
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Look, it's starting.

90
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,020
I haven't seen such beautiful fireworks in a long time.

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Do you know who gave me your lyric book?

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Your high school classmate,

93
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,800
Xu Qin.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
You sent Xu Qin to find me.

95
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Isn't that what this was all about?

96
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Your heart

97
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,120
isn't much cleaner than mine.

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
We're just using each other for our own needs.

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,050
Why are you pretending to be a good person now?

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Xinxin.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,620
Let's forget the past.

102
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
Look forward,

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
embrace new life,

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,280
and new people.

105
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
Just as you once

106
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
believed in me unconditionally countless times.

107
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,080
I will always

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
unconditionally

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
stand guard behind you.

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,920
Actually, I'd rather be the one

111
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,640
who holds an umbrella for you on rainy days.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
Xuanze.

113
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,640
Looks like you're the final winner of this game.

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

115
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,080
You used me

116
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,200
and now you want to kick me aside.

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Everything was your own choice.

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,520
I brought all this on myself.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,040
I accept my fate now.

120
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,280
But all those things you did behind everyone's back

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,520
will eventually be discovered by Tongxin.

122
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,080
Anning has already reconciled with Tongxin.

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,480
How long do you think you can keep hiding?

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,720
What's the relationship between Xu Qin and him?

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
Why would he help him so desperately?

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Xu Qin has always had a secret crush on Xuan Ze.

127
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
What?

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,200
But why would Xuan Ze betray me?

129
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry, but Mr. Xuan kept calling your name.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,080
We had no choice.

131
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,800
We had to use his phone to call you

132
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,130
and ask you to come here.

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
I'd appreciate it

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
if you could keep Xuan Ze's drunkenness today

135
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
and the fact that I came to pick him up

136
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,240
between us.

137
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,800
You can rest assured about that.

138
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,520
Our club has excellent privacy policies.

139
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
We never disclose our clients' affairs.

140
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,720
Good. Thank you.

141
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,650
You're welcome.

142
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,690
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

143
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
Why did you drink so much?

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
Xinxin, you're here.

145
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,800
Sorry, I'm drunk.

146
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm fine, I was just having

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
a casual drink.

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Come on, let's go back.

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,090
I need to talk to you.

150
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,490
Come with me somewhere.

151
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,620
I'll tell you everything.

152
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,560
Where are you taking me,

153
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Xuanze?

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,720
How is it?

155
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
Beautiful, isn't it?

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
So all this time,

157
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,220
the person who's been stalking me

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,100
and taking secret photos of me

159
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,920
wasn't An Ning,

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,640
it was you.

161
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,080
I love you.

162
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,520
Only here do I feel alive.

163
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Only here

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
do you belong to me.

165
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
It's been 10 years.

166
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,370
I've been by your side from high school until now.

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,250
I chose a career you like for your sake.

168
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,280
I love everything you love.

169
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,080
I don't understand why.

170
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,360
How am I inferior to him?

171
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
You love me,

172
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
so why did you and Xu Qin

173
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,360
destroy me?

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
You've been in contact with each other all along,

175
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,520
haven't you?

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,320
You even

177
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
encouraged her

178
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
to take my place.

179
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,720
I always thought

180
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,320
Xie Dayu deleted her apology video to me.

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
But now I realize

182
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,840
it was you too.

183
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,800
Few people knew about my new song.

184
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
The person who could leak the audio first

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
could only be you.

186
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,560
I can't tell anymore, Xinxin.

187
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
I can't distinguish

188
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,120
whether I used others

189
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
or others

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,240
used my love for you.

191
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,440
I can wait forever.

192
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,920
But you want me to watch helplessly

193
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,880
as he returns to your side again,

194
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,720
to watch you fall in love with him again.

195
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,880
I...

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
I can't do that.

197
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Do you even understand what love is?

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,880
I understand it too well.

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
In my heart,

200
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
Xinxin, apart from you,

201
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,160
there has never been anyone else.

202
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
You shine like the sun on everyone,

203
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
but you're not my sun.

204
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Xuanze,

205
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,060
you've become so strange.

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,400
Or perhaps

207
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,640
I never really knew

208
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,120
the real you.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,840
You keep saying you love me,

210
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,080
but you still don't understand me.

211
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,640
What I hate most is deception

212
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,900
and manipulation.

213
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,800
No, no.

214
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,960
Xinxin, it's all obsession.

215
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
It's all obsession.

216
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
If I don't fight for you,

217
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll never have a chance.

218
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,440
If I don't try my hardest,

219
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,940
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

220
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,840
But everything you've done

221
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,360
has only hurt me.

222
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
I truly love you.

223
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
I love you so much

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
that I don't want to share you with anyone.

225
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
I love you so much

226
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,880
that I'm willing to do anything for you.

227
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,960
I love you

228
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,120
a thousand, ten thousand times more than he does.

229
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,680
Xuanze.

230
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,800
You're really too selfish.

231
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,240
Yes.

232
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,320
I envy him so much.

233
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,800
I really envy him.

234
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
He's just luckier than me.

235
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,280
It's not about luck.

236
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,320
He's different from you.

237
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,400
He would never do something like this.

238
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
Xinxin, Xinxin, I was wrong.

239
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,480
Xinxin, don't leave me.

240
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll change. If you like something,

241
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,160
I'll become just like him.

242
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,420
I'll even surpass him,

243
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,400
if only you would look back at me.

244
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,440
Xuanze,

245
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,520
you're insane.

246
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,800
No, Xinxin, I'm begging you.

247
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
Let go. Please, I'm begging you.

248
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,610
Don't let go.

249
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,660
Don't let go of me. Don't leave me.

250
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,800
Jiang Yinchuan.

251
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Stop fighting.

252
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Xinxin, I'll take you home.

253
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
Xinxin! Xinxin!

254
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,170
Have a safe journey.

255
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,000
I hope abroad

256
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
you'll have better opportunities.

257
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,680
Huai Yanfeng.

258
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,319
Keling Temple.

259
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,960
Yang, Wang, Chen, Niu.
