1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
Happy birthday, Xinxin.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
See if you like it.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,800
I'll love anything you give me.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,920
Mine is blue.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,160
We're a pair.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,240
I declare this is the best gift I've received.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,410
Don't be so quick to decide.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,200
Take a look at mine first.

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,960
Not bad.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,160
Did you pick this yourself?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,040
Of course. Look,

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
when I first saw it,

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
I thought it was perfect for you.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Put it on for me.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,560
As you wish, miss.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,200
I'll put it on for you with full service.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,720
It looks quite nice.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,320
It really suits you, Xinxin.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,680
By the way,

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,320
do you have plans tonight?

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,400
Let's go celebrate.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Yes, we've prepared a party for you.

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,200
Tonight...

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,080
I already have plans tonight.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,800
We've always celebrated our birthdays together.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,440
Tell me, who are you meeting?

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,680
It's a secret.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,940
Jiang Yinchuan, I knew you'd be here.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,320
Where is it?

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,039
What thing?

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,100
Stop pretending. Where's my birthday gift? Where did you hide it?

32
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,840
I'm sorry,

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,720
I forgot to prepare one.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Forgot?

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,160
But I clearly

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
reminded you three days in advance.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,440
Fine, it's okay if you forgot.

38
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,880
I was worried you'd just give me a set of test papers anyway.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,410
Better to forget than that.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Come here, quickly.

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,320
Why don't you celebrate your birthday with them?

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
I haven't prepared anything at all.

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Because I want to.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,620
Light it for me.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,680
Never mind. It's too windy here.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,520
How about this? Sing me a birthday song.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,600
Consider it my birthday gift.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,040
I'll give you the tune.

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,240
Happy birthday to you.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
Sing.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,200
Happy birthday to you.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,960
Happy birthday to you.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,079
How many times have I told you

54
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,400
to knock before entering

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,320
my apartment?

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm an adult now.

57
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
I have my privacy.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,370
Why can anyone just come in and out of my place as they please?

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm changing the locks right now.

60
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,900
Come back here.

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,900
What privacy do you even have?

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,920
What?

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,520
So we're disturbing you now?

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,280
I've already explained everything.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Things aren't what they seemed to you.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,160
Tong Xin.

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,920
Are you even human?

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,880
My brother is injured.

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
He's hurt.

70
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,960
Look at the state he's in.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
And you still won't leave him alone.

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Can't you control your animal instincts for a few days?

73
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
He's not me, you know.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,279
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,120
Didn't we already discuss this?

76
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,620
I was trying to take a shower earlier.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
I couldn't undo my pants.

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
Tongxin happened to come by and she was helping me.

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,050
It's not what you're thinking.

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Did you hear that?

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,560
I can help you then.

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Bro, I've told you before.

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,300
You should come back home.

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Let me, the best brother

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
in the whole world, take care of you.

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
That Tongxin is useless at everything.

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,280
That princess.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,159
How could she possibly take care of you?

89
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,560
Let me tell you.

90
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Most of the time I can take care of myself.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,040
What happened earlier was a special case.

92
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
What do you mean you can? Why couldn't you earlier?

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,580
I'll help you shower. Let me help you shower.

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,040
Let's go.

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,530
Show me how to wash it. Hurry up.

96
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's talk outside.

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,240
Yi Yi's matter has been settled for now.

98
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,760
She has already faced legal consequences.

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,920
The company has appointed you as the spokesperson for Changfeng Resort Island.

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,000
We'll be shooting the promotional video in a few days.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Pack your things today.

102
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,820
We'll leave tomorrow.

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,320
No problem.

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,480
Sis.

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,450
For the promotional video,

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,250
can I bring someone else along?

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
What? You want to bring Jiang Yinchuan?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,960
I didn't say it was him.

109
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,320
No way.

110
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,159
This shoot is confidential.

111
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,640
No unauthorized personnel allowed on the island.

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,800
Please, sis.

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
Make an exception just this once.

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,450
Or you could count him as my accompanying doctor.

115
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,600
His hand is injured now.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
It's difficult for him to do many things.

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm worried about leaving him alone at home.

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Tongxin,

119
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,490
something's off about you.

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,760
You're going soft on Jiang Yinchuan again.

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,840
This reminds me of you in high school,

122
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,600
when your every move was influenced by him.

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,120
That's not true.

124
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,560
Well, he got injured because of me.

125
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
I should take responsibility.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,640
I would do the same even if it were Lin Bufan.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
I really would.

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,610
You don't have to tell me the truth.

129
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,080
But what you truly feel,

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,920
only you know in your heart.

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,440
He was so brave for me.

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,810
I'm no longer afraid to take steps toward him.

133
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,159
Sis, I've grown up.

134
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,960
This time, I want to try again,

135
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
to be brave once more.

136
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,580
You promised to scrub my back.

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,920
So all this time,

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,380
you just wanted to share the bathtub with me?

139
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
Come on, bro.

140
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,600
I'll definitely prioritize serving you.

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Where do you want me to scrub?

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
Don't move.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Let me ask you something.

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,530
You're dating someone?

145
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,280
How did you know?

146
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
With Tonghua.

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,040
Is it that obvious?

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,200
I thought I was hiding it well.

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Who do you think you're fooling?

150
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,940
She's the only woman in your life.

151
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,280
Looks like we're a good match.

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,240
Made for each other.

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,840
I used to think that

154
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
couples looking alike wasn't real,

155
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,280
but now I see it's quite accurate.

156
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
What are your plans for the future?

157
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Your mom called me yesterday.

158
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,940
I'm not going back anyway.

159
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,040
I have my own love and career now.

160
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,360
How could I possibly go back for an arranged marriage?

161
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,680
If she calls you again, just pretend you didn't hear.

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,280
You can't avoid going home forever.

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,400
You need to give your life

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
some proper planning.

165
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,330
I think things are pretty good now.

166
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,360
Tonghua.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,840
bosses me around every day.

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
And I'm happy every day.

169
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
I can be her driver

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,560
and take care of her daily needs.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
I think it's great.

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
Didn't you say before

173
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,970
that you didn't like women older than you?

174
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,540
Tonghua is different.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,280
I care about mental age.

176
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
Though Tonghua is a few years older,

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
I can tell that

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
she's just a little girl at heart.

179
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,080
She's innocent,

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,640
and adorable.

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
She's like a schoolgirl.

182
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,480
You have no idea how cute she is.

183
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Let me tell you,

184
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,520
Tonghua isn't

185
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
as simple as you think.

186
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,800
You kid,

187
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
don't get fooled and end up looking stupid.

188
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
I got it.

189
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,300
You worry too much.

190
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,480
Sis,

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,560
take all these cotton pads with you.

192
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,490
I've also prepared lots of snacks.

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
Sis, did you buy the wrong thing?

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
This isn't gum.

195
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
I know.

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
You know?

197
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,440
So I actually have a brother-in-law now?

198
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,560
Who is it?

199
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,620
Who managed to win my sister's heart?

200
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,940
What brother-in-law?

201
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,130
Just having some fun with someone.

202
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,010
Then you really should practice safe sex.

203
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
Hey, where are you?

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Do you want me to pick you up?

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm almost done here.

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,680
I'll be back soon.

207
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,800
Then tonight I...

208
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,020
Come to my place tonight, same time as usual.

209
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
What?

210
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,720
Lin Bufan?

211
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,570
You'd even go for someone like him?

212
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,690
Sis, you must be really desperate.

213
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
He might be a bit dumb.

214
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
But he's got a good body. Useful.

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,440
Changfeng Resort Hotel

216
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
is the most central hotel in the entire scenic area.

217
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
But it's still in a soft opening phase now.

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,040
There aren't many guests yet.

219
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
The grand opening will be next month.

220
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,760
The human soul truly belongs to the ocean.

221
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,220
This place is amazing.

222
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,580
There's a seafood buffet over there.

223
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,520
The whole team needs some preparation time now.

224
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,980
You can take a break first.

225
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,440
I get it. That means we have the day off.

226
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,600
Room key.

227
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
This is yours.

228
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,680
Room 7018. Where are you staying?

229
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
That's so far.

230
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,000
Room 7227. I'll be right next to you.

231
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
See you later.

232
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Coming.

233
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,160
I can't find my sunscreen.

234
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,360
Did you bring any sunscreen?

235
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,220
Can I borrow it?

236
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,240
Come in.

237
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,560
When I was packing,

238
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,220
I saw it on your dressing table

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
and packed it for you.

240
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,640
Dr. Jiang, you're being too fussy.

241
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,960
This is a brand new hotel.

242
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
We're the first guests to stay here.

243
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,100
It's probably a professional habit.

244
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,740
Your hand is injured. Let me help you.

245
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,120
Did I hear that right?

246
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,280
Miss Tong actually knows how to put on a duvet cover?

247
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,440
Who do you think you're looking down on?

248
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,200
I used to work for my pocket money when I was little.

249
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I can figure this out just by looking at it.

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,260
Wait, I'll put it on for you right now.

251
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,240
Jiang Yinchuan.

252
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,680
I can't find the opening.

253
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,370
Didn't you say you knew how to put it on?

254
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,500
Jiang Yinchuan, you're tricking me.

255
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
Let me out now.

256
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,040
Jiang Yinchuan.

257
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,440
Let me out quickly.

258
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,480
Jiang Yinchuan, let me out now.

259
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,080
Let me out!

260
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,440
Let me out!

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
Jiang Yinchuan!

262
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,120
I...

263
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,640
I'll let you out right away.

264
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
Come out now.

265
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,780
I haven't finished putting it on yet.

266
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,810
What's going on with Dr. Jiang?

267
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
He's a valuable talent

268
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,360
that I worked hard to recruit.

269
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,000
If his hand doesn't heal properly,

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
it will affect his future work.

271
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,280
Director,

272
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
Dr. Jiang didn't do it on purpose.

273
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,800
It was only because Tongxin was in danger at that time.

274
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
He was desperate to save her.

275
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
If he hadn't blocked it with his hand in time,

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,680
Tongxin's head injury would have been much worse.

277
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
Director, he's a doctor too.

278
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,080
How could he possibly stand by and do nothing?

279
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,760
Anyway,

280
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Yinchuan is injured.

281
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
Our hospital must do everything possible

282
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,640
to help Dr. Jiang.

283
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,600
Why is it Tongxin again?

284
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,860
I'll call some specialists right away for a consultation.

285
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,960
Ziran

286
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,849
Ziran

287
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,210
Ziran

288
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:22,690
Ziran

289
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,319
Kesong Pengnong

290
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:26,400
Keying Pengben
