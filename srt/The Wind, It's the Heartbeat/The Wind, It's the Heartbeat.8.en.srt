1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
So now you're brave enough to steal from middle school students?

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,680
No, I didn't.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,760
Do you know this is a crime?

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,320
I told you I didn't do it.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,800
Refusing to admit it, huh?

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,450
Student, come here.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,440
Tell me.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,240
Did he take your money?

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,400
Yes, it was him.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Get your facts straight.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,840
It was someone else who took your money.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,120
I was standing up for you.

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,280
Come on, tell me.

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,420
What's your excuse this time?

15
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,920
You didn't bring any of your homework.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
Was it soaked in the rain?

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,940
Or was it carried away by a dog?

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,440
Let's see what excuse you make up this time.

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,600
Someone has already reported you.

20
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,080
And you're still being stubborn.

21
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,880
You've always been skipping classes before.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,800
Now I see you're morally corrupt.

23
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,400
If you continue like this,

24
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,080
you'll end up in juvenile detention sooner or later.

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,240
I... Mr. Guo,

26
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,600
I can testify.

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,060
He didn't steal her money.

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
Tongxin, why are you butting in?

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,160
I'm asking about your homework.

30
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,720
I left my homework in the car.

31
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,440
You can testify?

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,640
Yes, I saw it.

33
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,800
Someone else was trying to steal this kid's money.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,200
This big dummy

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,760
the tall guy

36
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,720
helped chase them away.

37
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,840
Who are you?

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,200
I was standing at the entrance of the alley.

39
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,960
Don't you remember? I even complimented your skills.

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
This brother didn't steal my money.

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
It was my classmate.

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,480
I was afraid to tell the truth.

44
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,240
Afraid of being bullied again.

45
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm sorry, Miss.

46
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,520
I really didn't do the homework this time.

47
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,560
Alright, hurry back to class.

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Um, I...

49
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,500
You go back to class first.

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,720
Just to stop me from eating street food,

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,240
my parents cut off all my allowance.

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
I can't understand it.

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,850
How can middle-aged people resist something so delicious?

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
Here you go, handsome.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,840
Thanks.

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Oh, it's you.

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,260
To thank you for helping me today,

58
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
I'd like to treat you.

59
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,140
No need to thank me.

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,540
Really, it's nothing.

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,800
Then I won't be polite.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,880
How is it? Tasty, right?

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
Thank you.

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh, by the way,

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
I don't even know you.

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Why did you help me today?

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,860
Although I don't know you,

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,600
I happened to have helped that girl before too.

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,440
And I heard your family is quite wealthy.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,080
You wouldn't steal for just 10 yuan, would you?

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,680
This squid you bought me already costs 10 yuan.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,640
You trust me unconditionally just like that?

73
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,320
Maybe because we're the same kind of people.

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
I know how it feels to be misunderstood.

75
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,600
I don't think you did anything wrong.

76
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,880
That girl didn't do anything wrong either.

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,400
The ones at fault are those who bullied and hurt her.

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
I haven't asked your name yet.

79
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
My name is Tong Xin.

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,920
I know you're Xuan Ze.

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
From the class next door.

82
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
You know?

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
Wipe your mouth.

84
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,440
Thanks.

85
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,320
I can't even catch it.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,820
Why do you have so much change?

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
This isn't change.

88
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,440
These are arcade tokens.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,930
How about it?

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's go play.

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,440
Let's go! I was waiting for you to say that.

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,320
Wait.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,880
Have you finished your homework? You'll get scolded again.

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,320
Don't mention such a buzzkill.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Let's have fun first.

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
Wait for me.

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,240
It's Xuanze. Why is he here?

98
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
He's been Xinxin's friend for many years.

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,600
He must be here to see Xinxin.

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,659
Actually, I used to ship this couple.

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
But they had a bad ending.

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Don't be ridiculous.

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,610
Shipping everyone will only hurt you.

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,010
You brought me here.

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,730
Unexpected situation.

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,920
I understand.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
Senior Jiang.

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Long time no see.

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,520
Long time no see.

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,680
Xuanze.

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,780
Xinxin, will your concert be held as scheduled?

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,280
I'm preparing a lot.

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm preparing many new songs.

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,280
My concert will take place as scheduled.

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
Please look forward to it.

116
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,160
That's great!

117
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Xinxin.

118
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,480
I just got back to the country.

119
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,760
The team at the studio

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,120
is throwing me a welcome party tonight.

121
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,180
Let's go together.

122
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,760
Xinxin.

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Today

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
is our 100-day anniversary.

125
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
I've prepared a little surprise for you.

126
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,080
A surprise?

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,880
That's perfect!

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,600
She can attend my welcome party

129
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
and then go to your surprise.

130
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,440
Right?

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,240
Since it's our anniversary,

132
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,360
I'd prefer

133
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
if it was just the two of us.

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,200
What surprise has Dr. Jiang prepared for Xinxin?

135
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Can you give us a little hint?

136
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
Is it fireworks or flowers

137
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,040
or some other surprise?

138
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,680
Maybe it's the kind of surprise that can't be mentioned.

139
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,200
What kind of surprise?

140
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,320
I want to know what the surprise is.

141
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,720
Just look forward to the studio's Weibo post tomorrow.

142
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,800
It's getting late.

143
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,640
Everyone should go home now.

144
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,440
Let's go, Xinxin. Bye-bye.

145
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,200
Why are we here?

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
To pick out some clothes for you.

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,520
You must be joking. These clothes are so expensive.

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,960
I can't afford them now.

149
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,730
Let's not buy anything.

150
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,920
Let's go back. Don't buy anything.

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,560
Let's go.

152
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,020
Don't worry. The company will reimburse it.

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
The company benefits are that good?

154
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Of course. You're my driver.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
You represent my image.

156
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
So you need to dress well.

157
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,520
Try it on.

158
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,660
These clothes are so uncomfortable.

159
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,280
They're restricting my free spirit.

160
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Stand still. Don't fidget.

161
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
This is how you'll dress from now on.

162
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Got it?

163
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
Got it.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Give me your hand.

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,160
What a pain.

166
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,040
You did well yesterday.

167
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,000
More and more people are shipping you two online.

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,840
But we can't settle for just this level of buzz.

169
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,200
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

170
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,840
How?

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,880
I've already discussed it with Dr. Jiang.

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,940
We're planning to shoot a couple's vlog to post online.

173
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,640
He's prepared a bonfire on the beach waiting for you.

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,720
With the sea breeze blowing and the bonfire lit,

175
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,560
you can interact with Dr. Jiang,

176
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,760
it'll be so romantic.

177
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Do we really have to shoot this vlog?

178
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,600
I still need to prepare for my concert.

179
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,400
I don't have time.

180
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,360
No choice.

181
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,600
That's what happens when you had a bad reputation before.

182
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,760
We finally have a chance to turn things around.

183
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,200
We can't give up now.

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
What's wrong?

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
There's an issue with the new artist we signed.

186
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,760
I need to go back first.

187
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,440
The beach is just ahead.

188
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Just keep walking straight and you'll get there.

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
Remember to take good photos with Dr. Jiang.

190
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Send me the video when you're done.

191
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Bye-bye.

192
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,520
Xinxin.

193
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,960
I've twisted my ankle.

194
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,620
Could you come and check on me?

195
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
Where are you now?

196
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
I'll come find you.

197
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,640
Okay, I'll send you my location.

198
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,500
Alright, I'm coming over now.

199
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Xuanze, where are you hurt?

200
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,120
Do you need to go to the hospital?

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,040
It's nothing.

202
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,280
I just twisted my ankle. It's not serious.

203
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,240
Are you sure?

204
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
Really, I'm fine.

205
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,570
Then what are you doing here alone?

206
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,800
There's a fireworks show over there tonight.

207
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,640
I know a perfect spot to watch it.

208
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,100
Let's go together.

209
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,280
I have plans tonight. I can't join you.

210
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,080
How about I call your assistant?

211
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,960
Not good. Someone's taking photos.

212
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
Shh, let's go.

213
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,800
Xuanze, stop it.

214
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,460
I really have something to do.

215
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,960
Give me 10 minutes.

216
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,960
Look, it's starting.

217
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,200
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,530
Please try again later.

219
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,920
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,250
Please try again later.

221
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,860
I haven't seen such beautiful fireworks in a long time.

222
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
How is it? Beautiful, right?

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,520
Do you remember

224
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,180
when we set off fireworks together as children?

225
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,400
I remember

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,640
everything about you and me.

227
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Back then everyone played with sparklers,

228
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,920
but I bought snap-pops

229
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,800
and ended up covered in sand.

230
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
Such fond memories.

231
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
How beautiful.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,040
There's something there. Let me get it for you.

233
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Tongxin.

234
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Jiang Yinchuan,

235
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,890
what are you doing here?

236
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,200
Why did you stand me up without saying a word?

237
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,400
I was just about to look for you.

238
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,560
Are you blaming her?

239
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,940
Get this straight.

240
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,160
You're only her fiancé in name.

241
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
What right do you have to control her?

242
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Whether I have that right or not

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,680
is not for you to judge.

244
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,780
Mind your own business first.

245
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,260
It seems you're the one who's been hurting her all these years.

246
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,410
Alright, stop arguing.

247
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,540
It's freezing. Let's go home.

248
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,400
Xinxin.

249
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,160
I brought you here to see the fireworks.

250
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,220
I'll take you home.

251
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,240
Xinxin.

252
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
We live together.

253
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,770
I should be the one to take you home.

254
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
It's so cold out.

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,160
On that old bike of yours?

256
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,360
Excuse me.

257
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,240
Dr. Jiang now

258
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,080
is not the same Jiang Yinchuan as before.

259
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,880
You're still the same as before.

260
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
No need. I'll go back by myself.

261
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
Xinxin.

262
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,560
Ziran.

263
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Ziran.

264
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,120
Kesun Penglong.

265
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,200
Keke Jingsen.
