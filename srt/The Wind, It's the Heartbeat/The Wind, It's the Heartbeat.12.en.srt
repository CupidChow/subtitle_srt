1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
My parents gave me an ultimatum.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,280
If I can rank

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
in the top 100 in our grade for finals,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,520
then I can go to the competition with you.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,440
Really?

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,400
You're so smart.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,200
As long as you study hard,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,260
getting into the top 100 will be easy.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
We still have two weeks left.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,320
If we focus on catching up, you'll definitely make it.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's start with physics, your weakest subject.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Xinxin is terrible at physics.

13
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,440
And teaching her from scratch would waste too much time.

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,880
I think English would be the best subject to improve her grades.

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
Xinxin already has a foundation in English.

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,400
She can pass without tutoring.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,160
I think physics would give her the biggest improvement.

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,560
You don't understand Xinxin at all.

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,680
Physics requires flexible thinking.

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,410
That's what she fears the most.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,480
I've been teaching Xinxin recently.

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,960
I know her situation very well.

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm her best friend.

24
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,520
I know her better than anyone.

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,760
One is her bestie.

26
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,520
One is her crush.

27
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Who should I side with?

28
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,960
She has a foundation in English.

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,420
A good foundation helps her improve faster.

30
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,040
No matter how strong her foundation is,

31
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,440
there's a limit to how much she can improve.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,600
Let's wait until they figure it out before studying.

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,130
That's how she'll improve.

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
You're just making her study physics,

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
but she doesn't understand it at all. How can she catch up?

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
What is this place?

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Yiyi.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Hey!

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
Xinxin.

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,000
Where are you?

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,520
Mr. Tong said we'll meet at 12.

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,560
We'll talk with the shareholders then.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,720
Should I come pick you up later?

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I've already left. I had something to do.

45
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,880
It's just after 9. I'll get there even if I have to crawl.

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,479
Don't worry. I won't be late.

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,160
This annoying person.

48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,039
What's he up to now?

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,640
Who is it?

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,760
Open up!

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Open the door now!

52
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,360
Hello?

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
Is anybody here?

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,520
How have you been lately, Mr. Li?

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Not bad.

56
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,160
I endorsed a new phone last month.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,400
I think it's really good.

58
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,460
I'll bring it for you to try next time.

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,960
Sure.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,080
That phone is really beautiful.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,760
It's 12:30.

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Weren't we supposed to start at 12?

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Why hasn't Tong Xin arrived yet?

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,080
Is she standing us up?

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,180
Tong Xin is busy at the moment.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,520
Please wait a little longer, everyone.

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,760
We scheduled this meeting time long ago.

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,200
Everyone else is here.

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,120
She's the only one missing.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
Acting like a diva by being late.

71
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm concerned about her inability to keep appointments.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
It might cause many problems in our future cooperation.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,640
Please calm down, everyone.

74
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
Tongxin has always been like this.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,410
She's quite casual.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,079
And doesn't really care what others think.

77
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,880
But she doesn't mean any harm.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
If she's absent without reason,

79
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,610
we have no obligation to keep waiting for her.

80
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,840
Then it's settled.

81
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
Yi Yi it is.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,920
Yi Yi.

83
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,760
Her temperament is perfect.

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
Her appearance is also outstanding.

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
I think there's no problem with this.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,180
Not all candidates have arrived yet.

87
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,570
Mr. Li, isn't it a bit hasty to jump to conclusions like this?

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,780
Mr. Tong, what do you mean by that?

89
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,440
If she doesn't show up, we'll just keep waiting.

90
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,900
Then let's postpone until everyone is here.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,480
Hello.

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
Is Xinxin with you?

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,079
We agreed to meet at noon.

94
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
I can't reach her phone.

95
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,959
She hasn't shown up.

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,160
But Yiyi did come.

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,959
She left early this morning.

98
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,920
I thought she had already gone to the meeting.

99
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,400
Where could she have gone?

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,280
Song Yue spoke with her on the phone at noon.

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,940
She said she had something to take care of first.

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Xinxin!

103
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Such a remote place.

104
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Don't worry.

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,970
I'll go find her.

106
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,520
Are you okay?

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,540
Are you hurt anywhere?

108
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
Don't be afraid.

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
I'm here.

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
Don't be scared.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,520
I'm with you.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,920
Watch out!

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
Are you alright?

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
This way.

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,880
I'm already calling a car.

116
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,000
How's your hand?

117
00:06:59,159 --> 00:06:59,880
It's fine.

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Just looks scary.

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,370
I'll just need to get it bandaged at the hospital.

120
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,120
Why isn't anyone accepting the ride?

121
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
It's too remote here. What should we do?

122
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Let's wait by the roadside. Come on.

123
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,540
The car is here.

124
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,520
Get in the car, Xuanze.

125
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,810
Jiang Yinchuan.

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,800
What were you thinking?

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
You're a doctor.

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,780
Your hands are meant for surgery.

129
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,360
It was an emergency.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,890
I didn't think that far.

131
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,460
What if there are lasting consequences?

132
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,640
You worked so hard to become a doctor.

133
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,010
You might never be able to perform surgery again.

134
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,520
It's not that serious.

135
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,720
Don't worry, Xinxin.

136
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,600
Xinxin.

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,700
I'll drop you off at the intersection ahead.

138
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,440
Yueyue is waiting for you.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
You can still make it to the signing.

140
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm not going.

141
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,560
That endorsement is extremely important for you.

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,760
You must go.

143
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,880
I don't care.

144
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
Look at his condition now.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Of course I need to take him to the hospital.

146
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
What condition?

147
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,440
Yi Yi tricked you to go there

148
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,160
just to steal your endorsement.

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,440
If you don't go now,

150
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,640
aren't you falling right into her trap?

151
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
Don't worry, I'll take him.

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,860
It's okay, Xinxin.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
That's right.

154
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,600
Xuanze is here. What are you worried about?

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
But your hand...

156
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,200
There's nothing wrong with my hand.

157
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
I told you I'm a doctor.

158
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,919
I know my own body very well.

159
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,250
Don't worry, it's just a little blood.

160
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,480
See? I'm fine.

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay, I'll go now.

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,480
I'll be back soon.

163
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,640
Remember,

164
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,420
make sure you beat Yi Yi for me,

165
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,800
and get justice for my hand.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
Xuanze,

167
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,850
please take care of Jiang Yinchuan for me.

168
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,800
Sure, no problem.

169
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Don't worry.

170
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,240
Be careful.

171
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's go.

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,680
The promotional video team will arrive at the scenic area the day after tomorrow.

173
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,560
The promotion is also scheduled for next week.

174
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,800
We must finalize the candidate selection.

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,760
We can't delay any longer.

176
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,520
This scenic area promotion is extremely important.

177
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,360
We can't afford even the slightest mistake.

178
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,090
I also think it's better to make a decision today.

179
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,960
Since everyone understands the importance of this project,

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
we must be even more careful when choosing the spokesperson.

181
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,160
As we all know,

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,160
a spokesperson represents the company's image

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,090
and directly conveys our culture.

184
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,720
It's better to be cautious.

185
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,160
What do you mean by that, Mr. Tong?

186
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,280
Are you suggesting that I, Yi Yi, am not qualified to be the spokesperson?

187
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,140
Tong Xin disrespects the meeting and arrives late,

188
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
why don't you care about that?

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
Why are you so determined to choose her?

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,960
If your company has already decided on a spokesperson,

191
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,520
then you shouldn't have asked me to come here just to make up the numbers.

192
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,480
Our company has never predetermined anything.

193
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,540
We only believe in fair competition.

194
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Fair?

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,040
Don't you find that amusing, Mr. Tong?

196
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
You helped Tong Xin

197
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,730
steal resources using underhanded methods.

198
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,600
Who's really the one

199
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,260
using underhanded methods to steal resources?

200
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,400
Why are you here?

201
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,920
Are you okay?

202
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm fine. I'll explain later.

203
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,360
Seems my appearance surprised you.

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,680
Yi Yi, where should I be if not here?

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,040
In that warehouse

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,640
with no signal where you tricked me into going?

207
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,480
I've already called the police.

209
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,740
What's going on, Yi Yi?

210
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,920
What did you do?

211
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,160
I didn't do anything.

212
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Believe me, I didn't do anything.

213
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,800
I just received a call from the police.

214
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,460
They want us to come in to explain the situation.

215
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Tongxin.

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,300
Why did you call the police? What are you reporting?

217
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Tongxin.

218
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
I was just joking with you.

219
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,360
We can settle this privately.

220
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,560
Please don't call the police, Tongxin.

221
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,160
This is not a joke.

222
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,240
It's a crime.

223
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,120
Tongxin.

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
You're standing here just fine.

225
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
Nothing happened to you.

226
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,160
You caught me slipping, didn't you?

227
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,560
Why do you have to ruin me?

228
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,800
No one is hurt.

229
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,690
Save your story for the police.

230
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,090
What's going on?

231
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,120
Are we still choosing a spokesperson today?

232
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
One person just walked away,

233
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,240
and another seems to be playing legal expert.

234
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,320
How can we proceed?

235
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,640
We still need to decide on a spokesperson.

236
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
Otherwise...

237
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
Someone like Yiyi

238
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,170
will never be hired by our company.

239
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,610
Let's finalize the spokesperson.

240
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Tongxin

241
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Dr. Jiang, this is a penetrating wound.

242
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,520
If it doesn't heal properly,

243
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,780
it might affect your ability to perform surgeries.

244
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm aware of that.

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,600
Don't mention this to anyone,

246
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
especially Tong Xin.

247
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,600
Ziran.

248
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,800
Ziran.

249
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:04,640
