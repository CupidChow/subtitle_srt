1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,600
Xinxin, it's all set.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,240
Xinxin.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
It's just a school competition.

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,280
So what if you didn't make it?

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,210
You just didn't perform your best.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,360
Xinxin, we've grown up together.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,690
We share the same dream.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
We'll debut together in the future.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,240
Let's try again next time, okay?

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,120
Anan.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,690
This must be Jiang Yinchuan's vote for me.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,880
He's the only one in the whole school who voted for me.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,720
It's an anonymous vote.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
How do you know it was him?

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,440
Look. This is his draft.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,370
Isn't the handwriting identical?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,320
So what?

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,200
Do you like him that much?

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,760
He has good grades, good character, and good looks.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
And the only vote I got was from him.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,700
It shows he approves of me too.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,760
How could I not like him?

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,440
His father is your family's driver.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,080
The gap between you two is too big.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,720
What's wrong with being a driver?

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,580
Professions aren't hereditary.

27
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
Jiang Yinchuan

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,960
Why didn't anyone pick you up today?

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,320
Your dad is busy today.

30
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,600
He can't take me home.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,280
So now you're being requisitioned.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,479
You could take a taxi.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,680
I don't want to.

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,800
I can hold an umbrella for you if I sit behind you.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,060
Not everyone gets this special service.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,280
Jiang Yinchuan.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,320
Did you vote for me in the last competition?

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,759
Don't pretend.

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,479
I recognize your handwriting.

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,240
Tell me honestly, do you like me too?

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,970
You're just too shy to admit it.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Get off.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
What's wrong?

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,240
I was just kidding.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,720
Why do I keep thinking about the past lately?

47
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,200
Maybe

48
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,640
I should really do as he said

49
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,040
and meet this friend.

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,760
Break up immediately. Break up immediately.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,440
Your love won't last.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,200
Your union is impossible.

53
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Who's the crazy guy

54
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
making a scene at my door so early?

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,680
Alright, alright, alright.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
Alright my foot!

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
Watermelons, 5 yuan for 3 jin,

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
guaranteed ripe and sweet!

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,240
Watermelons, 5 yuan for 3 jin,

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,519
guaranteed sweet! I'm Lin Bufan.

61
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,480
If you have a death wish

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Go to hell.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,280
There are many ways to die.

64
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
You don't have to die by my hands.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Dr. Jiang as a fiancé

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
is really putting on a good show.

67
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
She doesn't usually eat breakfast.

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
I brought her something.

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,810
Jiang Yinchuan.

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,240
What exactly are you after?

71
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,880
Why are you still showing up around her?

72
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,440
You hurt her so deeply before.

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Now you want to pretend nothing happened?

74
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,250
I don't have any ulterior motives.

75
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,560
I just want to help her.

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,400
That might fool Xinxin.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
But unfortunately,

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
I'm not falling for your act.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,320
Because

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,960
I regret it.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,880
See? People are just like this.

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,740
Always gluttons for punishment.

83
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,800
I couldn't protect my sister when I was studying abroad.

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,360
But things are different now.

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,080
Let me tell you, Jiang Yinchuan.

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,640
Whatever you're scheming in your mind,

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,280
you'd better drop it right now.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,440
I won't let you hurt her again.

89
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,680
Tongxin, let me tell you.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
As long as you don't break up with my brother,

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
I won't move from here.

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm staying right here.

93
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
I'll blast my speakers every day.

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
I'll make sure everyone in this neighborhood knows.

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Your love

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,880
won't last.

97
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,940
Your relationship is doomed to fail.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Hand it over.

99
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Let me tell you, I'm not afraid of you.

100
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,970
I'm not afraid of you at all.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
He hit me. What are you doing?

102
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Lin Bufan.

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,360
Didn't I tell you to go back to my place?

104
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Why are you here again?

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
It's you.

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,960
That rude lady.

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,400
Are you crazy?

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,520
First thing in the morning, without even brushing your teeth, you're attacking people.

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,560
This is my sister.

110
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,680
Who are you?

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
I am...

112
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,770
I didn't notice.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,720
I really didn't notice.

114
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
What's wrong?

115
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Mr. Tong, the scratch on your car door is long and deep.

116
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,080
Fine.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
You accused me of scamming.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
Called me a gold digger.

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,159
And now you've forgotten all about it?

120
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,520
You two are really in cahoots.

121
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Lin Bufan.

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
Stop making a scene here.

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,159
Go back quickly.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,159
You two brothers are really

125
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,420
quite the characters.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,520
One's a clam,

127
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,760
the other's a loudspeaker.

128
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,680
I, Tong Xin, must have owed you both in my past life.

129
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
Xinxin.

130
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
Watermelons, 5 yuan for 3 jin,

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
guaranteed ripe and sweet!

132
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
Watermelons, 5 yuan for 3 jin.

133
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,970
Guaranteed ripe and sweet!

134
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
Xinxin!

135
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,240
Breakfast.

136
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,300
- Get out!
- Xinxin!

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
Xinxin.

138
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Lin Bufan.

139
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,760
If you keep making trouble,

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll call your aunt right now and have her take you back.

141
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Do you hear me?

142
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,000
She called you a clam.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
So what if she called me names?

144
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
Would it kill you

145
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,700
to show some backbone?

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
You, go back.

147
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,460
You're completely clueless.

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Why can't you have just a little dignity?

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,520
Gourd Baby.

150
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Xinxin.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,260
Open the door, please.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,960
Miss.

153
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,920
Tong Xin's sister.

154
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
Can't you hear me?

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,560
You got away last time,

156
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,360
but don't think you'll escape this time.

157
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,280
Add my WeChat.

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Kid, I don't have time to play with you.

159
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,840
Miss, I'm not interested in you.

160
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm not some player trying to hook up.

161
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,760
I'll pay for the damage to your car.

162
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,890
I don't need your money. Run along now.

163
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,980
Stop treating me like a child.

164
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I, Lin Bufan,

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
am an honest and upright person.

166
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,920
No, I mean, I, Lin Bufan,

167
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
am a person of integrity.

168
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,840
No, I mean, I, Lin Bufan,

169
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,880
am... am honest.

170
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,559
Just tell me how much and I'll transfer the money.

171
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,760
Seriously.

172
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Here's the repair estimate.

173
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,340
A total of 30,000 yuan.

174
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
30,000?

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,880
Are you trying to scam me?

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
I have the insurance company's number.

177
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,690
You can verify it yourself if you want.

178
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,080
If you dare to do it, you must dare to face the consequences.

179
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,280
Pay up.

180
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,640
It's just 30,000.

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,880
I wouldn't have batted an eye in the past.

182
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,400
But now...

183
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,280
Recently,

184
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,680
I have to pay for this car.

185
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Don't look down on me.

186
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,240
What are you going to pay with?

187
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,840
Can't I pay in installments?

188
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
How about this? Come work as my driver.

189
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,320
My driver just went on paternity leave.

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,000
Work as my driver for a month,

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,280
and we'll call it even on the 30,000.

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,840
Me, be your driver?

193
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,720
What's wrong?

194
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
Can't drive?

195
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,120
Are you kidding?

196
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
Driving is so simple.

197
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
Wait.

198
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Someone as talented as me,

199
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
working as your driver?

200
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,760
Kid.

201
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
Think about it. You can't find

202
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,490
a more suitable job than this anymore.

203
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,400
Or would you rather call your mom

204
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
to come and pay for it?

205
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
It has nothing to do with her.

206
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,020
One month means one month.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
I haven't even started making money

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,810
and now I'm losing a month of labor?

209
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
Tong Xin.

210
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,600
Are you...

211
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Tong Xin.

212
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,440
Tong Xin.

213
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

214
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
I just got rid of the reporters.

215
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,280
Yinchuan has already told me about your situation.

216
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll help you overcome your psychological issues

217
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
so you can sing again.

218
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
I have a concert coming up soon.

219
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,560
I'm afraid there's not enough time.

220
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
If you fully cooperate with me,

221
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
I think it won't take long.

222
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,840
By the way.

223
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Yinchuan and I are good friends,

224
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,720
so you can trust me completely.

225
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,560
As you know, I'm a public figure,

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,000
so this matter

227
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,760
cannot be known by anyone.

228
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,200
Of course.

229
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,680
Including Jiang Yinchuan.

230
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,410
Absolutely.

231
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
They're pushing us again.

232
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,770
Is Tongxin's theme song recorded yet?

233
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,160
She couldn't finish recording last time.

234
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Probably still traumatized by what happened before.

235
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,920
This theme song,

236
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,980
she probably won't be able to sing it.

237
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,280
What do you mean she can't sing?

238
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,100
Xinxin said she'll pay the penalty herself.

239
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,680
Is this just about the penalty?

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,440
'Princess' is

241
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
a Golden Eagle Award-nominated film.

242
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,960
It's definitely going to be a hit!

243
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,240
She's just giving up such a great opportunity?

244
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,720
Besides, the concert is coming up soon.

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,800
If she can't sing,

246
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
what about the album?

247
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,960
If worst comes to worst, let's find someone else to sing.

248
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,200
We can't give the movie theme song to someone else.

249
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Mr. Xie, Xinxin won't agree to that.

250
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
This won't work, that won't work.

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,800
If she keeps not being able to sing,

252
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,930
how is my company supposed to survive?

253
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Mr. Xie, we've found the person you wanted.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
What do you want to ask?

255
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,560
Dr. Jiang, is Tong Xin really your fiancée?

256
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,520
Didn't you say you weren't a fan of celebrities?

257
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm not a fan of celebrities.

258
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,020
But I am a fan of my wife.

259
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
When did you two meet?

260
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Did you...

261
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,600
Have you done your rounds today?

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Not yet.

263
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
Then what are you waiting for?

264
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
Go do your rounds now.

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,240
The theme song for the movie 'Make Way for the Princess'

266
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,520
was released at 8 o'clock.

267
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,920
It's performed by popular singer Tong Xin.

268
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,480
Congratulations, Dr. Jiang.

269
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,540
Your fiancée has released a new song.

270
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,840
She's so beautiful.

271
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
Bluestone paved street,

272
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,450
a touch of slanting sunset.

273
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,240
Memories drifting away.

274
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,760
Xinxin, why are you here?

275
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,400
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

276
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I could have sent a car to pick you up.

277
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Who did you get to sing the 'Princess' theme song?

278
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,520
I've already said I won't accept a ghost singer.

279
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,680
Doing this will destroy your reputation.

280
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,440
My tenth anniversary concert is coming up soon.

281
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,240
It should be my gift to the fans.

282
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
There absolutely cannot be someone else's voice in it.

283
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,440
You know the current situation.

284
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,080
Using a ghost singer is our only option.

285
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,810
It's the only solution we have.

286
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes, and that girl who's singing for you,

287
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,960
she's your fan.

288
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
She really admires you.

289
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,560
Don't worry about confidentiality.

290
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,620
The company will handle everything.

291
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,580
Yong

292
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,920
Ziran
