1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,560
An'an.

2
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,120
An'an.

3
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,960
Tong Xin's latest single 'Starfish'

4
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,360
has won the Global Chinese Music Chart's Annual Gold Award.

5
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
Tong Xin has also become mainland China's most popular female singer.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,280
Tong Xin shows off her star power, competing with veterans on the same stage.

7
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,600
Tong Xin reached her peak right after debut.

8
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,560
With her talent alone,

9
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,240
she revived the nearly bankrupt Xingmeng Entertainment.

10
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Our reporter: Industry friends reveal Tong Xin's chaotic private life.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
The highly controversial queen of headlines, Tong Xin.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,360
Confusing statements top trending searches again.

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,240
Netizens critique Tong Xin as fallen music idol.

14
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Famous singer Qian Yuan comments on Tong Xin.

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,240
Born with a silver spoon.

16
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,479
Tong Xin's disrespect for seniors sparks debate.

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
Possibly becoming the most unwelcome female singer in entertainment.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,640
Up so early?

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,920
There are lots of packages at the door.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,320
I'll open them for you.

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
This troublemaker isn't turning on the lights again.

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,940
What kind of delivery is this?

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,900
Why isn't there a shipping label?

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,440
It must be that obsessed fan causing trouble again.

25
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,120
This person has been harassing you since your debut.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Text bombing and secretly following you wasn't enough.

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,220
Now it's getting worse and worse.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,490
Let's call the police then.

29
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Okay. I'll handle everything.

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,000
Calm down.

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,330
Don't let someone like this affect your red carpet tonight.

32
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,600
Patient in shock. Call thoracic surgery.

33
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,080
Trauma team, general surgery, ENT, blood bank.

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,210
Check blood pressure. Prepare the OR.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
Doctor, heartbeat has been restored.

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
Patient has multiple fractures.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,700
Check for hemothorax.

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,640
Family members, please come with me.

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
This way. Don't worry.

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Dr. Wang.

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Is this Dr. Jiang Yinchuan?

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,800
I didn't expect him to be so young and handsome.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Dr. Jiang, it's you.

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Director Wang.

45
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I happened to be passing by.

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,450
Just lent a hand.

47
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Dr. Jiang

48
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,720
is our director's

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,320
prized recruit from abroad.

50
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,800
He's an outstanding ENT specialist

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,399
and a medical genius.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
So young and already a chief physician.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,560
His future is limitless.

54
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,920
He's so handsome.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
Thank you for your help, Dr. Jiang.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
It's your first day here.

57
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,240
Wang Ming will show you to your department.

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,300
I'll go check on the situation there.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay.

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,520
Let's get to work.

61
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
Dr. Jiang, wipe your hands.

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Thank you.

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,290
Our department is that way.

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,960
Could you hold this for me?

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Sure.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
Dr. Jiang, you're a fan too?

67
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,040
You also like Tong Xin?

68
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not a fan.

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,560
Let's go.

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,860
Not a fan but still helping wipe her face?

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
We'll leave after finishing the styling.

72
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,410
Have something to eat first to fill your stomach.

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,560
With that level of skill, she has the nerve to sing my song.

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm embarrassed for her.

75
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,720
Please stop mentioning that Yi Yi.

76
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,800
These days online,

77
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
it's flooded with her paid articles.

78
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,200
She just wants to leech off you and ride on your popularity.

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Yesterday she actually said she's planning an anniversary concert.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,840
She's obviously copying you.

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,760
She's even attending the red carpet event later.

82
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,360
Probably wants to create some buzz with you.

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
As long as she doesn't dance in front of me,

84
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,960
I couldn't care less about her.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Right. Let's just ignore her.

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,770
Let her perform her one-woman show alone.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,840
As usual,

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
if you get nervous before going on stage,

89
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
have a mint first.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
It's nothing.

91
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,080
I don't need it.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,360
Finally, I can see the person I like.

93
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,640
Xinxin!

94
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,280
Yiyi!

95
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
Oh my god! Yiyi is wearing the same dress as Tong Xin!

96
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,520
Someone like Yiyi, a nobody,

97
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,840
is obviously just trying to get attention on the red carpet.

98
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,170
Whoever looks worse will be embarrassed.

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,159
Xinxin!

100
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Xinxin! Look over here!

101
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Xinxin! What a coincidence!

102
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
We're wearing the same outfit!

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,580
Don't you think this could be like a sister look for the red carpet?

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,730
Quick, let the media take more photos of us together.

105
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,040
Are we that close?

106
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,880
This dress of mine is a luxury brand haute couture.

107
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,120
There's only one in the world.

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,640
You know very well where yours came from.

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,840
Xinxin!

110
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,720
She's getting angry.

111
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
Oh no, we're going to be trending again.

112
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,040
Oh my God! I'm so sorry!

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
I didn't notice your dress hem.

114
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Are you okay? Is your dress alright?

115
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,560
Xinxin, I didn't mean to.

116
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,000
I apologize to you.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
Please don't be angry.

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,600
Do you want to change your dress?

119
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,180
Is it that serious? [Slapping sound]

120
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,600
Why is she hitting her?

121
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,020
This is the only apology I'll accept.

122
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,040
Hey! Stop right there!

123
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,760
You followed me all the way to the women's restroom.

124
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,290
I'm right in front of you. Why are you running?

125
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
You're the one who sent me that junk this morning, aren't you?

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,130
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,120
You peep, stalk, harass...

128
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
constantly finding new ways

129
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,560
to invade people's lives from the shadows.

130
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
Does this give you some sense of accomplishment?

131
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,420
Don't use your illness as an excuse to do whatever you want.

132
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,380
You don't even recognize me anymore.

133
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
An Ning.

134
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,160
You stole my life.

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,530
What right do you have to accuse me?

136
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,460
You're insane.

137
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,560
An Ning.

138
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,600
An Ning.

139
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,600
An Ning.

140
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,400
Potential career paths: AI medical algorithm engineer, bioinformatics expert, medical data analyst, telemedicine technical support.

141
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
Dr. Jiang.

142
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
Director.

143
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
Everything has been taken care of here.

144
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,320
Alright.

145
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,160
Miss Tong.

146
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,000
Miss Tong.

147
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Doctor, how is she doing?

148
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Your friend brought her in just in time.

149
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,690
She's out of danger now.

150
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
The wound has been stitched up.

151
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,040
Don't worry.

152
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Good. Thank you, doctor.

153
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,920
You're welcome. Get some rest.

154
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Is your wound healed?

155
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,040
It's fine. All healed.

156
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
Yesterday's incident was caught on camera and is now trending.

157
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
The internet is blowing up.

158
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,160
They're saying you drove a fan to suicide.

159
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
The company has received word.

160
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
Mr. Xie wants to talk to you.

161
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,840
Don't you want to discuss solutions with Mr. Xie?

162
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,960
The charity performance is about to start.

163
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,040
We need to come up with a plan.

164
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,580
There's nothing to discuss. Let's rehearse first.

165
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
Yes, this position.

166
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,400
Xinxin, let's get started.

167
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,640
What's going on? Why isn't she singing?

168
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,120
What's happening? Sing!

169
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,160
Every song you sing now,

170
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
every lyric,

171
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,200
every melody,

172
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,680
is a knife killing me.

173
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,600
You stole my life.

174
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,460
What right do you have to blame me?

175
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,840
What's wrong? What's happening, Xinxin?

176
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,920
That's right.

177
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,200
I am the rat in the gutter you talked about.

178
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
I've been watching your life,

179
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,840
but everything you have now

180
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,760
should have been mine.

181
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,400
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been in that car accident.

182
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
My voice wouldn't have been ruined.

183
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,400
All your achievements now

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,040
