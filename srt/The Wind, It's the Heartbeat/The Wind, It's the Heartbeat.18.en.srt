1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,720
Putting all kinds of dirty and smelly things on you.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,280
Does this person have any shame?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,720
He just saw I was cold

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,880
and kindly offered me his coat.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,800
What kindness?

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,600
I think he has ulterior motives.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,860
If you're cold,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,120
wear mine.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,720
Lin Bufan.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Why are you being so rude to Wen Nan?

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,040
He's getting handsy with my girlfriend

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,880
and verbally harassing her.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,410
Am I not allowed to be upset?

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,800
Lin Bufan, I think you've misunderstood.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,040
We're not in the kind of relationship you think.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,200
What do you mean?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,319
Are you really planning to dump me for this pretty boy?

18
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,520
I just called you and you didn't answer.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
Did he touch your heart?

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,880
That's not what I meant.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,960
I never agreed to be your girlfriend.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Is it because I was jealous just now

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,280
and you think I'm childish?

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm really trying hard to change.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
I want to be a mature boyfriend.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
I didn't mean to be jealous just now.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
Lin Bufan,

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,480
we have different definitions of this relationship.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,280
What's different?

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,039
Can't I be your boyfriend?

31
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,770
What am I not doing well enough?

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
Lin Bufan.

33
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,320
We're simply not compatible.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Your life is full of unknown possibilities.

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,400
Your life is like an adventure.

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,640
Because you're young,

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,080
you can act without considering the consequences.

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,360
But I can't.

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,160
I need a clear future

40
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
and a suitable partner.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,759
We...

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
How are we not suitable?

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,520
Tell me.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,000
I can change.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
What you feel for me now is just a momentary impulse.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
Right now you're willing to accommodate me

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,919
and follow my pace.

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,160
But when the passion fades?

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,000
You'll realize that

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
forcing yourself to please someone else

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,700
is the most exhausting and foolish thing you've ever done.

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,680
Tong Hui.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,680
Singer Tong Xin holding a fan meeting at LIVE HOUSE.

54
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,010
This is also her first public appearance since the breakup.

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,360
Not many people came today.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
It's just a small venue.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Don't be nervous.

58
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Don't worry, I can handle it.

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,680
Come on!

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:00,280
Xinxin! Xinxin! Xinxin!

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
I'm so happy everyone could come to my fan meeting.

62
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,160
Long time no see, my dear fans.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,050
I've missed you all too.

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,959
I've missed this stage.

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,839
I love music and singing.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,880
That's why I picked up the microphone

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,720
and stepped into the spotlight.

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,280
In the blink of an eye, ten years have passed.

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,300
Throughout this journey,

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,720
you've always been by my side.

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
Actually,

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm not a good person at all.

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,320
You're wonderful, Xinxin.

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm selfish

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,320
and always causing trouble.

76
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,960
All these years,

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,720
it's been all of you

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
who have always accepted me.

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,000
Love me.

80
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Trust me.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
Xinxin, we will always believe in you.

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,380
Especially during this time.

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,320
Around me,

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,200
many bad things have happened.

85
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,760
My so-called fan

86
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,090
committed suicide.

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,240
My music career has been affected.

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,480
And I've been caught in a romance scandal.

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,800
Sorry for making you stay up late defending me online.

90
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I can honestly say

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
it's your support

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
that has kept me going until now.

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
Today, I promise you all.

94
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,280
My 10-year anniversary concert

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,740
will be held as scheduled.

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I won't let you down.

97
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
Thank you all so much.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,840
Xinxin, we love you!

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,040
Xinxin, we will always love you.

100
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,930
It's because you all love me

101
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,800
that I don't want to deceive you anymore.

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,490
After I finish singing,

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
I will tell you everything honestly.

104
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
No matter what you say,

105
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
we believe in you.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,580
We will always be your Aixin fans.

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,240
We are all your Aixin fans.

108
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
Fly bravely, Xinxin. Your Aixin fans will always be with you.

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Before I start this song,

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
I have a small request.

111
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
I hope everyone

112
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,920
can hold up your light sticks

113
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,600
and immerse in this song with me.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,360
The sudden downpour.

115
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,720
Yet I don't want to take shelter.

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,960
I have nowhere to go anyway.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,040
Everywhere are remnants

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,120
of memories all about you.

119
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,840
The rain turning the city upside down.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,920
Has someone replaced me?

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,760
I never heard from you again.

122
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
Never saw you again.

123
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,320
Who is this person?

124
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,360
I don't know.

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,680
Hello everyone, I'm Xu Qin.

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,360
I've always been the one singing for Tong Xin.

127
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,720
All of her singles.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Who are you? What's going on?

129
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Today

130
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,970
I can finally step out from behind the scenes.

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,170
Thank you everyone.

132
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
What's going on?

133
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Where did this nobody come from trying to cause trouble?

134
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
How could Xinxin's song possibly be sung by her?

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,120
Impossible.

136
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,520
No way.

137
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,840
Who let you come up here?

138
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,570
What nonsense are you talking?

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,060
Where's security?

140
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,380
What's happening? Get her off the stage now.

141
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
You're the one who should leave.

142
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,620
This stage rightfully belongs to Xu Qin.

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,290
What are you saying?

144
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,120
I've loved singing since I was little,

145
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,720
but because I wasn't pretty enough.

146
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,720
I've never had confidence

147
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
or the courage to stand on stage.

148
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,840
Until high school,

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
when I met Tong Xin.

150
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,679
Tong Xin and I were high school classmates.

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,360
But

152
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
she not only bullied me,

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,240
but also forced me to write songs for her.

154
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Since then,

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,850
Don't be impulsive. There are still fans down there.

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,440
I never had the courage to stand on stage again.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,400
How could she bully anyone? Exactly.

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,600
Impossible.

159
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,040
Tong Xin has always been arrogant, willful, and unprofessional.

160
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,640
This kind of behavior isn't surprising at all.

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,040
For ten years,

162
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,000
all of Tong Xin's original singles

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
were created by Xu Qin.

164
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
Please look at the big screen.

165
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
This is the evidence.

166
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
The sudden downpour

167
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't want to avoid it

168
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,400
There's nowhere to go anyway

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,240
Everywhere are remnants

170
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,440
All recorded memories are about you

171
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
As the person in charge of the company,

172
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,890
I can no longer tolerate Tong Xin's behavior.

173
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,920
Talented singers like Xu Qin

174
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
shouldn't be overlooked because of their appearance.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
So this time I hope

176
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,920
to introduce the real Tong Xin to everyone.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
A bully like her

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,080
has no right to be on stage.

179
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
Get her off!

180
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
Right. The evidence is conclusive.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,160
What's left to argue about?

182
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,960
Impossible.

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,840
Xin Xin!

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,800
Videos and photos can be fabricated.

185
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Why should I believe everything she says?

186
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
We need to believe Xinxin.

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Believe Xinxin.

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
You're lying.

189
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,840
Why are you doing this?

190
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,360
Believe Xinxin.

191
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,240
We don't want to see Tong Xin. Make her get off the stage.

192
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Get off!

193
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
Xinxin!

194
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,320
Get off!

195
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,440
Xinxin, are you okay?

196
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,320
Get off!

197
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
What a spectacular performance.

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
How is it?

199
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,760
Feels good to fall from the top, doesn't it?

200
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
All of this.

201
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,720
You did this.

202
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
That's right.

203
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,740
I acquired Xingmeng Entertainment.

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,770
I also turned Xie Dayu against you.

205
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,440
Made him work with Xu Qin

206
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,720
to completely replace you.

207
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,920
Why?

208
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,160
Weren't we friends?

209
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
Friends?

210
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,640
If you really considered me your friend,

211
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,500
you wouldn't have stolen my life.

212
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,360
Your achievements, your status,

213
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
all those fans and lovers crowding around you outside,

214
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,640
they should have all been mine.

215
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,010
I don't understand.

216
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,680
What do you mean I stole your life?

217
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,280
I never hurt you.

218
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
Someone as selfish as you

219
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
would never realize when they've hurt others.

220
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,080
Don't you want to know

221
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,920
why even Xie Dayu betrayed you?

222
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,840
Because you're arrogant and willful,

223
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
causing trouble everywhere without any concern.

224
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,520
You never cared about the company's development,

225
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,760
yet you expected everyone to clean up your messes and make excuses for you.

226
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
Did you think everyone was your servant?

227
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
What's happening to you now

228
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,240
is karma.

229
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
I won't deny it.

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,440
I was indeed willful before.

231
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,840
Always making people around me worry.

232
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,850
But that doesn't give you the right to twist facts

233
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
and slander me.

234
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,880
An'an.

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,760
What have you experienced abroad all these years?

236
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,920
Why are you so different

237
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,610
from how I remember you?

238
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
What I've been through?

239
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,680
Shouldn't you know better than anyone?

240
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,280
If it weren't for you,

241
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,760
I wouldn't have lost everything

242
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,290
and gone abroad to recover.

243
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,930
That accident was unexpected.

244
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,760
It's not what I wanted to happen either.

245
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,320
Since you came back,

246
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,440
I've actually been happy.

247
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,580
But I was afraid of upsetting you.

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,360
We grew up together.

249
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,090
You should know better than anyone

250
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,880
what kind of person I am.

251
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,920
If you really believe

252
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,810
that I stole your life from you,

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,440
I can leave this industry

254
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,970
and never be a singer again.

255
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,360
But...

256
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,320
I will never admit to crimes I didn't commit.

257
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I will definitely clear up the truth

258
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,560
and prove my innocence.

259
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,760
Why provoke her?

260
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
What?

261
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,000
Feeling sorry for her?

262
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,080
You sent Xu Qin to find me,

263
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,280
wasn't it for this exact reason?

264
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
Your heart

265
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,780
isn't much cleaner than mine.

266
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,040
We're just using each other.

267
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,760
Why pretend to be a good person now?
