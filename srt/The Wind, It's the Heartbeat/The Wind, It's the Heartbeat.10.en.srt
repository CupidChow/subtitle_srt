1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,040
Don't open your eyes.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm not.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,610
Jiang Yinchuan.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,600
There's a Leo meteor shower tonight.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,360
I already know without looking.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,000
We won't see any meteor shower tonight.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,240
Because the weather forecast says

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,360
it's going to rain tonight.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,920
If I say we can see it, then we will.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,520
Ready for the meteor shower?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm ready.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,920
Three, two, one.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,960
Look.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Beautiful, isn't it?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,760
I specially made this for you,

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,290
the Tongxin meteor shower.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
It's very beautiful.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,800
Make a wish quickly.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,930
Wishes made to stars really come true.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,840
My first wish.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,120
I hope your mother gets well soon.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,160
My second wish.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
I hope I can debut with An'an

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,320
and become the best singers in the world.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,200
Wait.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,810
If you say your wishes out loud, they won't come true.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,360
My third wish.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,920
I want to be with Jiang Yinchuan.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,360
I hope all of Tong Xin's wishes come true.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
Xinxin.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,919
The lead actress for my music video had an emergency.

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,050
Thank goodness you came to the rescue.

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,280
We're so close.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,140
Of course I'd say yes when you ask.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Look.

36
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,680
You haven't changed at all since high school.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,810
Still so beautiful.

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,280
What? I've changed a lot.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
I was so alternative in high school.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm much prettier now.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,600
Who said that? Our Xinxin has always been the most beautiful.

42
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Hello, Xinxin.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Today I'll explain to you

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,320
what this music video is about.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
Our song is about having a secret crush.

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,840
You'll play a high school girl

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
who has a crush on her senior classmate.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
But it's unrequited love,

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,240
your senior doesn't like you back.

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,700
In the end, he rejects you.

51
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,280
And here's the shocking part:

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
your senior

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,880
ends up with your best friend.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
When playing this role,

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,040
you need to really put your heart into it.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,079
I know you two are good friends,

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,620
but you're really no match for her at all.

58
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't bother me anymore.

59
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,250
You're really degrading yourself like this.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,020
You must remember.

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Alright.

62
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,200
It's okay, Xinxin.

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,940
If you're uncomfortable,

64
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,720
we don't have to force it.

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,480
It's fine.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
You know what,

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,560
I'm quite experienced with this kind of scene.

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,840
I can definitely act it well.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Let's begin.

70
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
Scene 4, take 1.

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,200
Those who have hurt you

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
should be abandoned.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,080
Okay.

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,080
Come on.

75
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,320
Everyone stop!

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,440
Jiang Yinchuan.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
I like you.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,960
I don't like you.

79
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,210
Stop deluding yourself, will you?

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
You're nothing compared to her.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
I don't like you.

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,730
Stop deluding yourself, will you?

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
You're nothing compared to her.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,560
I don't like you.

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,640
You're nothing compared to her.

86
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,130
Stop deluding yourself, will you?

87
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,160
What's going on?

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,680
I don't know either.

89
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Let's go check.

90
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,660
What happened?

91
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,250
What's the situation? Can we shoot or not?

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll go check.

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Don't worry.

94
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,240
Are you okay?

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,560
I'm fine.

96
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Actually, acting was quite enjoyable.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,340
Then you might develop a multi-talented career in film and music.

98
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
Maybe it's because

99
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
I have similar experiences to the main character.

100
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
After all, in high school...

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
Xinxin.

102
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Actually, I asked you to come here

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,600
because I wanted to tell you.

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
Let go of the past.

105
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,880
Look forward

106
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,880
and embrace a new life.

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,600
Embrace new people.

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,920
Just like you have

109
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,760
trusted me unconditionally countless times before,

110
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,120
I will always

111
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,840
unconditionally

112
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
stand by your side.

113
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
So you knew she would be hurt.

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
Why are you here?

115
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,330
Today's script is quite interesting.

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,800
I never thought

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,840
someone would use their job

118
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,980
to deliberately bring up her painful memories.

119
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
Get this straight.

120
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,000
I've never been the cause of her pain.

121
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,720
It's the things you did

122
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
and the words you said.

123
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
What are you angry about?

124
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,679
Why are you so angry?

125
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,320
You don't deserve to be in her presence.

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,000
You have no right.

127
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you two done making a scene?

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,880
This is a film set.

129
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
Get out.

130
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
Xinxin.

131
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,760
Everything that happened today,

132
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
I can explain it all to you.

133
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
You won't leave?

134
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,400
Then I will.

135
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Xinxin.

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
Xinxin.

137
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,720
Xinxin.

138
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
You said before

139
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,640
that you were with him for revenge,

140
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,720
but have you really accomplished that?

141
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,040
Are you having second thoughts?

142
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,370
Follow-up appointment tomorrow.

143
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,000
Bro, don't be sad anymore.

144
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,440
She's really out of line.

145
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,840
What's the point of being so good to her?

146
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,840
You got into a fight with that jerk,

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,200
and she took his side.

148
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,370
It's not worth fighting for someone like her.

149
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,940
Think about how you used to be,

150
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,800
how emotionally stable you were.

151
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
Now you're in a relationship and

152
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,840
you're getting into fights.

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
I lost my temper today.

154
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,080
The reason I hit him

155
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,200
is because everything he said was true.

156
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,880
Bufan.

157
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Tell me,

158
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,640
should I never have

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,760
appeared in front of her again?

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,970
Brother, don't be so hard on yourself.

161
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Did I go too far just now?

162
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,960
I don't support Tongxin,

163
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,560
but I want you to be happy.

164
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,320
Happy?

165
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,000
But without her,

166
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,380
how could I possibly be happy?

167
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
Your condition seemed fine before.

168
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Why has it gotten worse this time?

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Can I recover before the concert?

170
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,600
Don't worry.

171
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,560
Tell me what's been happening lately.

172
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,200
I can clearly see you're distracted.

173
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,640
Your mood seems down.

174
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,560
Is something bothering you?

175
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
It's nothing.

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,520
I've just been frequently remembering things from the past.

177
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,400
Those past events

178
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,130
are the main cause of your psychological trauma.

179
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
Tongxin,

180
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,360
you must try to let go,

181
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,280
otherwise you'll never move forward.

182
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,040
I can't forget.

183
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,360
Forgetting is too difficult for me.

184
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,600
It's not about forgetting,

185
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,860
it's about letting go.

186
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,610
If you can't find peace,

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,400
then you'll never be able to sing again.

188
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
What the hell?

189
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,520
Is everything you said true?

190
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,600
Spreading rumors and defamation have legal consequences.

191
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,640
I'm not spreading rumors.

192
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,880
I saw and heard it myself.

193
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,120
That guy said

194
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Tongxin can't sing because of psychological issues.

195
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,320
No wonder during the last performance,

196
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
she opened her mouth for ages

197
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,520
but couldn't sing a single note.

198
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,960
She even fainted on stage.

199
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
And that time recording the theme song,

200
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,920
it was also a huge struggle.

201
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,520
In the end, it was thanks to you stepping in for her.

202
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,120
Otherwise, who knows how much money the company would have lost.

203
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,280
This is not a small matter.

204
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,740
I'll go ask Tongxin first.

205
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
If she wanted you to know,

206
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,960
would you need to ask her?

207
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
That guy also said

208
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
Tong Xin might never be able to sing again.

209
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,320
We're done for.

210
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,040
The company is finished.

211
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,320
We were counting on her star power to make money,

212
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
but now that's gone.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,260
Everyone might as well pack up and leave.

214
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,760
I have an idea.

215
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,400
If I could sing for her once,

216
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,080
why can't I do it again?

217
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I could completely become Tong Xin.

218
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
No way.

219
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
Have you forgotten what Tong Xin said before?

220
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,970
How dare you even think of that?

221
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,160
But she can't sing now.

222
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,520
Are we supposed to wait indefinitely for her recovery?

223
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,600
Even if we can wait,

224
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,800
can the concert wait?

225
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,560
There must be a solution.

226
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,200
When she was at the peak of her fame,

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,880
she chose our small company.

228
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Now that she's in trouble,

229
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,680
are we going to abandon her?

230
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,600
Ziran.

231
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,240
[Hand gesture]

232
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,120
Ziran.
