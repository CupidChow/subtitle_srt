1
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,720
Oh my god.

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,600
Didn't someone spread rumors about Tong Xin being with a rich guy?

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,080
So that rich guy is actually Uncle Tong.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,280
Can you stop being so dramatic?

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,320
Also,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,960
don't you have anything better to do?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Why are you always hanging around here?

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,040
I don't.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,000
I quit my job.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Lin Bufan.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Did something happen between you and Tong Hua?

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,320
What could possibly happen between us?

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
It's just

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,340
an ex-driver and ex-boss relationship.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,160
If that's the case, you should go back to your mother's place.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,960
She's looking for you every day.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm not going back.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,520
If I go back, she'll make me go on blind dates again.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,100
Then what do you want to do?

20
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,000
Bro, do you think

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,410
I could be my sister-in-law's driver?

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,600
Isn't she opening a studio?

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,210
Perfect timing.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,880
I'm an experienced driver now.

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,010
You really love this job that much?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
Yes, I do.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,880
Something terrible happened!

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,140
Tongxin is in trouble.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,479
Tongxin.

30
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,840
Be careful!

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,080
Xinxin!

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,080
Xinxin!

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,960
Are you okay?

34
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
Are you hurt anywhere?

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm fine. Don't worry.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
That's good.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm relieved.

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,760
I thought something happened to you.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Why is he the one in bed?

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
It was Xuanze who saved me,

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,500
otherwise I would have been the one who fell.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,240
Tongxin,

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
go to hell!

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
Has Xu Qin gone mad?

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
How dare she attack someone with a knife!

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,060
She has always slandered Xin Xin before.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Now she's desperate.

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,700
It's not surprising she's gone to extremes.

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,680
Anyway,

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,820
thank goodness you were here.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
Thank you for saving Xin Xin.

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,360
What are you thanking me for?

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,840
She's my friend.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,620
Of course I had to help her.

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,880
Are you okay?

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm fine.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,160
When I heard what happened,

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,240
I was terrified.

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
Are you really okay?

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm fine. Sorry for worrying you.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
Next time you go out...

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,720
Xinxin.

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Xinxin.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
I'm thirsty.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,329
I'll get you some water.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
He's a patient now,

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,100
so I should take care of him as his doctor.

68
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,480
You should rest here properly.

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Leave everything else to me.

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Drink some water.

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,600
The water is here.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,040
Drink more.

73
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Careful!

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,440
It's fine. No big deal.

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,280
How are you feeling? Should I find a caregiver for you?

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,080
No need.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,320
I don't want others to know I'm injured.

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,770
It's all my fault. I've dragged you into this.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't say that.

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,000
You're a victim too.

81
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
You saved me.

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,130
I haven't even thanked you yet.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,159
Jiang Yinchuan thanked me,

84
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,560
you should thank me too.

85
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,820
So you don't consider me a friend?

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,000
No, that's not what I meant.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
If you really want to thank me, that's fine.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Then I'll trouble you, big star,

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,720
to personally take care of me while I'm injured.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
I don't want others to know about my injury anyway.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
You got hurt saving me.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,520
Of course I'll take care of you

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,250
until you're fully recovered.

95
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,720
It's fine. Be careful.

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,180
It's nothing. No big deal.

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
Take it slow.

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,600
Slow down.

99
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,720
Don't catch a cold.

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
By the way.

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,700
After the new studio is established,

102
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
what will be your first new song?

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,320
I want to release 'Gravity of the Heart',

104
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
the song I wrote

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,650
for Jiang Yinchuan in high school.

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,490
I finally found the lyric book,

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
recovered this song,

108
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,560
and I want to reclaim our youthful memories together.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,600
Just this one?

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,080
No backup plan?

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,040
Yes, I only want to release this one.

112
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,810
I couldn't finish this song before for various reasons.

113
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,880
Now I want to make up for that regret.

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,000
I feel like

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,370
the relationship between you two has improved a lot.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080
I misunderstood him before.

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,080
Now our misunderstanding is cleared up,

118
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,210
and we both want to give each other a chance to start over.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,500
Aren't you afraid of making the same mistake again?

120
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,720
No,

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,340
I've thought about it.

122
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,960
I should be brave for once.

123
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,159
I can't miss out on someone I truly like

124
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,440
just because I'm afraid of getting hurt.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,080
You'll wish me well, right?

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,560
Of course.

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,960
You're the person I want to be happy the most.

128
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
I knew it.

129
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,520
You're my very best friend.

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Yes, indeed.

131
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
Dr. Jiang is off work.

132
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
See you tomorrow.

133
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,600
What's wrong?

134
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,760
Jiang Yinchuan.

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,780
It's getting late.

136
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm here to take you home.

137
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,440
It's so late.

138
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
I should go now.

139
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Xinxin.

140
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,500
Didn't you say you'd stay and take care of me?

141
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,600
Are you going to leave me here alone again?

142
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
I should...

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,760
You should

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,930
come back with me and get some rest.

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,040
Your injuries aren't serious.

146
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,700
You can take care of yourself.

147
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
If you need someone to look after you,

148
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,770
there are nurses available here anytime.

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,720
I don't want anyone else.

150
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,880
I only want Tong Xin.

151
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,120
Xinxin.

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,560
The hospital says I can be discharged tomorrow.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080
I just need to come back regularly to change my dressings.

154
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Can I stay at your place to recover?

155
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,400
Stay at my place?

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,880
I've already cleaned up the room

157
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
You can stay here for now.

158
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,820
Thank you, Xinxin.

159
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,480
Tongxin.

160
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,280
Why does he get to sleep in the guest room

161
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,540
while I have to sleep in the storage room?

162
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,600
So Dr. Jiang has been staying in the storage room.

163
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,960
Xuanze is injured, isn't he?

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
Besides, he's our guest.

165
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,560
How could he sleep there?

166
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,520
You're right.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,880
After all,

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
Xuanze is

169
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
a guest.

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Xinxin.

171
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
I want to scrub my back,

172
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,360
but I'm afraid of pulling my wound.

173
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Could you help me?

174
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,800
Sure. Just wait a moment.

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll go run some water.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,560
Xinxin, let me do it.

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Xuanze and I are both men,

178
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
so it's more convenient for us.

179
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
It's not convenient.

180
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,320
Why not?

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,360
Don't worry about it.

182
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Xinxin, Xinxin.

183
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,220
Rest assured, I'll take good care of him.

184
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,760
Xinxin,

185
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
Xuanze, what water temperature do you prefer?

186
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,160
Water my foot! I don't need your help.

187
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,080
Let me help you.

188
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,880
You took a knife for Tong Xin this time.

189
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,480
I should thank you.

190
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,840
Wait.

191
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,520
Thank me?

192
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,250
Why should you thank me?

193
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,560
What are you to her?

194
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,840
Who asked you to thank me on her behalf?

195
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,640
You're crazy.

196
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,160
Just clean yourself.

197
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm not yet.

198
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,520
But I will be.

199
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,720
If you're trying to use this opportunity to get close to her,

200
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,520
I suggest you give up that idea right now.

201
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,920
Weren't you

202
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,520
using the same trick to get close to Xinxin before?

203
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,580
We're in the same boat here, brother.

204
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,540
Don't do that. It's too ticklish.

205
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,080
Be gentle.

206
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
It hurts.

207
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,000
You're just too tense.

208
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
Relax. I won't hurt you.

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,240
Easy, easy.

210
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,880
Don't yell.

211
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,760
Do you even know how to clean properly?

212
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,040
Since I promised,

213
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
I'll clean you up properly.

214
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,240
I just—

215
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
Sorry to interrupt. Carry on.

216
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,240
It's not—

217
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,960
Xinxin.

218
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,360
Xinxin! Xinxin!

219
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,800
Give it to me.

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,040
So annoying. Get out, I'll do it myself.

221
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,440
You didn't want me to rub it.

222
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,440
What's wrong?

223
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
Are you uncomfortable sitting?

224
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,360
Here, use this as a cushion.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
How's that?

226
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
Much better. Thanks.

227
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,080
You don't have to keep me company.

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,800
It's late. You should get some rest.

229
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,460
Take good care of your injury.

230
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,840
It's fine. I want to watch too.

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Let's watch then. It's no problem, I'll stay with you.

232
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,720
Foreign films are so bold.

233
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,610
He has clubbed fingers.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,250
Jiang Yinchuan.

235
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,960
You walk so quietly. You scared me to death.

236
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
The male actor in the film.

237
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,480
His nails are curved from base to tip.

238
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,040
This is a typical symptom of clubbed fingers.

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,760
This indicates that the actor

240
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,920
likely has a cardiopulmonary disease.

241
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,680
I'd like to ask Dr. Jiang.

242
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
When you see this kind of scene,

243
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,720
all you think about is...

244
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,840
What else should I be seeing?

245
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,680
We're all adults here,

246
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
no need to act innocent, right?

247
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,840
What are you trying to say?

248
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
What I'm saying is,

249
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,240
could it be that certain organs of yours

250
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
have some functional issues?

251
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Leading to your purity.

252
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,840
Instead of talking nonsense here,

253
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,280
you should get some rest.

254
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,610
Your injury will heal faster that way.

255
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Oh, alright. Bye, Xinxin.

256
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Pure of heart.

257
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,890
Free of desires.

258
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,640
How wonderful.

259
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,090
What are you looking at?

260
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,820
You should rest early too.

261
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,610
What trash is she watching?

262
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,580
Why didn't he refute Xuanze's words?

263
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,520
Is he guilty?

264
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,920
Did he admit it?

265
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,720
No way.

266
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
Jiang Yinchuan

267
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,480
Tong Xin

268
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Why are you here?

269
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,200
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to sleep.

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,120
Sleep?

271
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,360
In my bed?

272
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,260
This is my house. I can sleep wherever I want.

273
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
Sleep...

274
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,060
Wen Weiyanfeng

275
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,840
Ziran

276
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,680
Ziran

277
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,400
Keling Pengnong
