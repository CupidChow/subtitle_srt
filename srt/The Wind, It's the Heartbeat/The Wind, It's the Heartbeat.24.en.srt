1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,080
Are you hurt?

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,880
I'm fine.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,440
I can't believe Xuanze would do such a thing.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
I'll definitely make him pay for this.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,360
Let it go, sis.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,690
It's all in the past.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,850
I don't want to dwell on it anymore.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,360
What are you going to do about your new song?

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,720
I'm going to rearrange it.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,560
'Heart Gravity' will be even better.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,360
We really owe Jiang Yinchuan for this.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,080
Otherwise who knows

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,010
where Xuanze would have taken you.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,560
Xinxin, have you made up your mind?

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,490
Are you really sure about being with Jiang Yinchuan?

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,840
He is my one and only choice, without a doubt.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
He hurt you so deeply before.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,080
Now that he's getting close to you again,

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,560
I can't help but think he has ulterior motives.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
But now it seems

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,250
he really does love you.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,400
Seeing my Xinxin so happy

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
makes me really happy.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,760
Sis, it can't just be me who's happy.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,200
You need to be happy too.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,730
What's going on between you and Lin Bufan?

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,920
Him and I...

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,200
It's impossible.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
Why?

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
When he first got together with you,

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,560
he was so proud and happy.

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,370
Why did it suddenly change?

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,240
We were never together.

34
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,970
That was just his imagination.

35
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,120
Besides,

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
we're not right for each other.

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
Don't talk about compatibility first.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,440
I just want to ask you one question.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,680
Do you like him?

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,400
What's the point of liking someone if you're not compatible?

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,729
We could never end up together anyway.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
Xinxin, in this world,

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
not everyone is as lucky as you.

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,570
To meet someone you like who's also right for you.

45
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,080
Most people

46
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
are just settling.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,479
And

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,479
life can't be sustained on feelings alone.

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
If you thought this way from the beginning,

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,240
why did you give him hope?

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What happened between us was an accident.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,440
Sometimes you're just too clear-headed and rational.

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
This actually makes it harder to see

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,160
what you truly want.

55
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,880
Thank you for ordering our couple jackets.

56
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,920
The customization process takes some time,

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
so thank you for your patience.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,400
Wishing you both sweetness and happiness,

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,329
lasting love and a lifetime of joy.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,300
If these custom items weren't non-refundable,

61
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
why would I put up with this?

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,020
They say love doesn't stay fresh,

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,810
but who knew it would spoil so quickly?

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
That heartless woman

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
completely shattered my heart.

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,760
She still leaves traces in my life even now.

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Whenever I think of her,

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,900
I just feel a burning rage inside.

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,960
By the way,

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,490
there are still all her photos in my phone.

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,240
Delete them.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,840
Go ahead

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,560
and get married.

74
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,050
Who else could take care of you?

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Who else could be your driver?

76
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,010
Find someone old and ugly to spend your life with.

77
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,480
What's wrong?

78
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,170
Why are you crying, Fanfan?

79
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,200
It's my fault.

80
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Mom apologizes to you.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,980
I shouldn't have ignored your feelings.

82
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,760
If you don't want an arranged marriage, I agree.

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,720
Mom,

84
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
you're the best.

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
What's really going on?

86
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
Are you homesick?

87
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,000
If you miss home, just come back.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,120
Okay.

89
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,800
Huahua.

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
I knew you'd come back to me.

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,159
After all, you're as smart as I am.

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,480
We're both at marriageable age.

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,200
Within our available options,

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800
you and I are indeed the best choice for each other.

95
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,530
Since we've reached an agreement,

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,680
let's set the wedding date soon.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,280
We'll fulfill our parents' expectations of this life milestone

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,210
and satisfy our families' wishes.

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,160
Afterward, we can live more freely.

100
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,160
So what's your plan?

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,600
My family has a hotel on Xiji Island.

102
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,360
To make it convenient for both families to attend,

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
we can hold the wedding there.

104
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,600
After marriage, we'll each focus on our own work.

105
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Look, I found a really beautiful place.

106
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
I heard the food there is delicious.

107
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,140
I'll take you there sometime.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,890
You'll definitely like it.

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,250
You're back so late.

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,200
The food and I have been waiting for you for ages.

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,130
It'll get cold if you don't eat now.

112
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Hurry up.

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
I made your favorite beef brisket burger.

114
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,159
Household matters can be left to the housekeeper.

115
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,440
I've mentioned to you before.

116
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,120
During our marriage,

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,080
we can completely live our separate lives.

118
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,600
You don't interfere with me,

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,330
and I won't interfere with you being with others.

120
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,900
As long as we don't cause any trouble,

121
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,040
I hope our marriage can be open

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,480
and inclusive.

123
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,760
How can that work?

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,970
Loving someone means being completely devoted.

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
What's the point of having one foot in two boats?

126
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,060
Are you worried I might cheat?

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,640
Impossible. I, Lin Bufan, from head to toe,

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,040
inside and out, belong only to Tong Hua.

129
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
If you have any concerns,

130
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,120
we can sign a fair prenuptial agreement.

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
Here's to a pleasant marriage partnership.

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,400
Your ring is a couple's style, isn't it?

133
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Do you like it?

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,330
I can buy one for you too.

135
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,720
You keep saying

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
that after marriage we can live our separate lives.

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
But let me be blunt.

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,400
When a child says they need to pee,

139
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,040
they've actually already wet themselves.

140
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
You're right.

141
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,880
I do already have someone I like.

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,500
But she's not the best marriage partner.

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
Does this bother you?

144
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,840
You shouldn't ask if I mind.

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,080
You should ask if the person you love minds.

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,360
Lin Bufan.

147
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,040
Can you turn up the temperature?

148
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
I'm freezing in here.

149
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
Yes, boss.

150
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,720
Lin Bufan.

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,240
We're just not compatible.

152
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
Your life is full of unknown possibilities.

153
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Your life is like an adventure.

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,000
Because you're young,

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,840
you can afford to be reckless.

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
But I can't.

157
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
I need a clear future

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,320
and a suitable partner.

159
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
How are we not right for each other?

160
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,080
Tell me.

161
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,160
I can change.

162
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,960
What you feel for me now is just a momentary impulse.

163
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,320
You're willing to accommodate me now,

164
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,640
following my pace.

165
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,300
But what happens when the passion fades?

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
Lin Bufan.

167
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm the foolish one.

168
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm not brave enough,

169
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
too afraid to face my true feelings.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Why don't you go see him off?

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,640
Do you want me to go?

172
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,080
Of course I don't.

173
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,160
But he is your friend after all.

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,520
If you want to say goodbye to him,

175
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,780
I can drive you to the airport.

176
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,120
Xuanze and I

177
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,180
have already taken different paths.

178
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
Living our separate lives well

179
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,920
is the best choice for both of us.

180
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,680
I never realized before

181
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
that Xuanze had those kinds of feelings for me.

182
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
Jiang Yinchuan,

183
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,680
tell me,

184
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,540
am I too slow to notice things?

185
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,000
I think

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
it's not that you're slow.

187
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,520
Before, your heart only had room for one person,

188
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
so you couldn't see anyone else.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,620
Who? I don't know what you're talking about.

190
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
Really don't know?

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,320
No.

192
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,480
Do you know now?

193
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Still don't know?

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,680
Do you know now?

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Jiang Yinchuan, I'm back.

196
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
My song 'Heart Gravity'

197
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,820
won the Best Original Song Award.

198
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,160
Jiang Yinchuan.

199
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,360
I didn't expect Dr. Jiang to be so romantic.

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
It's a bit cliché.

201
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,200
But I really like it.

202
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,360
Thank you.

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,460
Congratulations.

204
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,680
Don't move.

205
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
There's a small bug on your shoulder.

206
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
Where?

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,280
Let me catch it for you.

208
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,320
It looks like a small spider.

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Jiang Yinchuan, you...

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,680
Got it.

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,520
Xinxin.

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm so happy to be part of your youth.

213
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,440
And I'm grateful

214
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,160
that I can still be with you at this moment.

215
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,520
You're like a warm sunshine

216
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,120
that brightens and warms my life.

217
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,120
In the days to come,

218
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,940
I want to be with you every single day.

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,360
Xinxin,

220
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,160
will you continue this journey with me?

221
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
That's so sudden.

222
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
Aren't you afraid I might say no?

223
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,160
I've waited all these years.

224
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,200
If you don't accept,

225
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
I can keep waiting.

226
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,600
Until you accept me.

227
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,440
Not a bad attitude.

228
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,560
Then I'll

229
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
say yes for now.

230
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,320
Later,

231
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
I'll see how you perform.

232
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
My third wish

233
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,600
is to be with Jiang Yinchuan.

234
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,520
I hope all of Tong Xin's wishes come true.

235
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,560
Mom said no pressure. We won't force you.

236
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,480
But that girl is really outstanding.

237
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Even if you don't date her,

238
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
couldn't you at least be friends?

239
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,980
More friends means more opportunities.

240
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm already preparing to go to the airport.

241
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,680
Mom knows, but she's also in China.

242
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,000
I heard she really wants to see you too.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Since you have time, why not chat with her?

244
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
Alright then. Send me the address.

245
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
I'll go meet her.

246
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
I've sent her the address.

247
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,000
She'll pick you up.

248
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,440
This is the same model as Tonghua's car.

249
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,800
So all these rich people like the same car.

250
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,720
Hello, I'm Lin Bufan.

251
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
Why are you here?

252
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,480
Get in.

253
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,680
Get in what car?

254
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,000
I won't.

255
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,020
I'm not getting in.

256
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,400
I suggest you drive away now.

257
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,400
My fiancée will be here to pick me up soon.

258
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't let her misunderstand.

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,440
So you have a fiancée?

260
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes, I do.

261
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,120
My family arranged it.

262
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
What's it to you?

263
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,120
My fiancée and I are a power couple.

264
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
We're perfectly matched.

265
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,840
You think you're the only one who can find someone suitable?

266
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,040
I'm even better at it.

267
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Do you like your fiancée?

268
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Of course I do.

269
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
I like her very much.

270
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
We fell in love at first sight.

271
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,360
We're inseparable.

272
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,160
We're...

273
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,850
We're about to have a shotgun wedding.

274
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,720
Excuse me.

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,880
I need to go.

276
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm afraid you don't even know your fiancée's name.

277
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,680
Or what she looks like.

278
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,040
How is that possible?

279
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,200
I know very well.

280
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,460
Let me tell you.

281
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,520
Her name is...

282
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
Her name is Tong...

283
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,920
Hua.

284
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,840
You're the fiancée my mother arranged for me?

285
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,760
That's right.

286
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
I just found out too.

287
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,440
I was very reluctant before.

288
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,120
But now I'm quite satisfied.

289
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Get in the car, my fiancé.

290
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,440
I refuse to be your fiancé.

291
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't agree to this marriage.

292
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,180
I won't accept this arrangement.

293
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,920
Ziran.

294
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,840
Ziran.

295
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:14,600
Yangran.

296
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,440
Ziran.

297
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,480
Keying Temple.
