1
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,840
We agreed to get into the top 100,

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,800
but we missed it by just one place. How unlucky!

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,880
Xinxin.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
What's wrong?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,720
Did the teacher say something to you?

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,720
You seem upset.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,120
Anan,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,720
what if I didn't do well this time?

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,720
It's okay.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
We can compete again next year.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
There are competitions every year.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,480
I'm sorry I held you back.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,280
Maybe you should go on without me.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,760
Enter the competition by yourself.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,440
I can't keep making you wait for me.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,720
What nonsense are you talking?

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,160
We're a team.

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,620
We must compete together.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Take out your test paper.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,800
I'll tutor you properly.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,860
You'll definitely do well next time.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Wow!

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,920
Who made this?

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,800
It even has your photo on it.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,880
So cute!

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
Heart-shaped.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,760
Since your name is Tong Xin,

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,039
your fans can be called 'Love Xin.'

29
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,500
They can cheer for you with this light stick.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,640
Why did you bring me here?

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
You made this for me, didn't you?

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
I've been too busy to do these things.

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Don't give me that.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,000
This was clearly made by you.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,960
The photo sticker is proof.

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Last time I thought the photo looked ugly,

38
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
so I threw it in the trash.

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,160
You were the only one there.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
Who else could have picked it up?

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
And you even printed it on a light stick.

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are you supporting me and pushing me away at the same time?

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,540
There's no reason.

44
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
There's no future

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,760
between us.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
Why isn't there a future?

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Is it because

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,250
I'm entering the competition?

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,760
What if I debut later

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
and we're no longer on the same path?

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,920
Don't worry, I'm not going to the competition.

52
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,200
I didn't do well on the exam anyway,

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
so I can't go.

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
Just because of this,

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,160
you're going to give up

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
the dream you've been chasing?

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
You've worked so hard for so long.

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,280
It's not about me not trying hard enough now,

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
the circumstances just don't allow it.

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,360
I failed the exam

61
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,640
and you're ignoring me.

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,120
Even if it's for a dream,

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,920
it shouldn't be this torturous.

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,320
The Tongxin I know isn't like this.

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,050
Don't make me lose respect for you.

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,610
Let me perform a magic trick for everyone.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
Watch carefully.

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
Now, fireworks!

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,610
Is it beautiful?

70
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
So beautiful!

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Continue.

72
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,920
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

74
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
Please try again later.

75
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Hello?

76
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,760
Is this Xuanze?

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
An Ning.

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Find out for me

79
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,760
where Tongxin is.

80
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,840
The scenery here is beautiful.

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,159
We can shoot MVs here in the future.

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
An Ning.

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,090
What are you doing here?

84
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,159
I need to talk to you.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,400
Instead of worrying about why I'm here,

86
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,720
you should be concerned about Jiang Yinchuan's hand injury.

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
His hand injury affected the nerves.

88
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,000
It will impact his career.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Which means

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,080
he might never be able to perform surgery again.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
That's impossible.

92
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
He told me it was nothing.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,490
He never told me about this.

94
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,920
Now you choose to believe him?

95
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
Or deep down,

96
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,560
you're just a coward trying to avoid the truth.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,690
Does him saying that

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,960
make you feel less guilty?

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
I don't.

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,010
I've always blamed myself.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Tong Xin.

102
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,930
You haven't changed at all.

103
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
You're such a selfish person.

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
You only care about yourself.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
You never care about others.

106
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,760
Did you ever truly care about Jiang Yinchuan?

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
You always self-righteously claim you hate him.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,080
That you want revenge.

109
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,340
Yet you shamelessly enjoy his kindness.

110
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,520
You have no shame.

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you know how hard it was for Jiang Yinchuan to become a doctor?

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
How much he struggled?

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,520
You have no idea.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,920
But I do.

115
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,360
I've seen it all.

116
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,040
Now you've ruined everything for him.

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Tongxin.

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,060
Wasn't ruining me enough for you?

119
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,440
Now you have to ruin Jiang Yinchuan too?

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,840
I've always said

121
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,960
you're nothing but bad luck.

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,660
Anyone who gets involved with you will suffer sooner or later.

123
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,640
His hand injury affected the nerves.

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,200
It will impact his career.

125
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Which means...

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,080
He may never be able to perform surgery again.

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Your hand...

128
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,810
It's almost healed.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,640
I can get the stitches removed when I go back.

130
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,900
You still tried to hide it from me.

131
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,740
The wound goes through your entire palm.

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
You might never be able to hold a scalpel again.

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,480
Right?

134
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
It's all my fault.

135
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,000
I ruined your career.

136
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,620
What does this have to do with you?

137
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,920
Even if I can never hold a scalpel again,

138
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,000
that was my own decision.

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Don't be so sad.

140
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,720
Life isn't just one single path.

141
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,620
Even if I can't be a clinical doctor anymore,

142
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,919
I can still continue with research.

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm really good at academics,

144
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
you know?

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,720
If you had been the one injured that day,

146
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
I would have truly gone crazy.

147
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Jiang Yinchuan.

148
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,240
You're such an idiot.

149
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm not an idiot.

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,800
I'm just afraid of losing you.

151
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,200
This wine is quite good.

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
Mom and Dad,

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,200
what are you doing here?

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
Xinxin.

155
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,400
Let me look at you. You're always so busy,

156
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,520
we barely see you a few times a year.

157
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,440
Your sister told us you were filming on this island,

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
so she brought us here.

159
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,840
We can spend some time together

160
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,570
and have a little vacation too.

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Mom, I've missed you so much.

162
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,760
Hello,

163
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,960
it's been a long time.

164
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Xiao Jiang.

165
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
You've grown taller after all these years,

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,880
quite handsome now.

167
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,260
Thank you, sir.

168
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,720
Your sister told me everything about your situation.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
Don't carry your burdens alone when you have parents.

170
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,320
Xiao Jiang, we really can't thank you enough this time.

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
Our Xinxin would have been in trouble without you.

172
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,640
It's nothing, ma'am.

173
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Is your hand feeling better?

174
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,480
Much better.

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,720
I'll get the stitches removed in a couple of days.

176
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,080
Jiang, you and our Xinxin,

177
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,480
are you two together now?

178
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
Dad, what are you saying?

179
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
I'm sorry, everyone.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,960
I'm late.

181
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,290
The first rule of meeting the in-laws:

182
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,520
dress properly in a suit and tie

183
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,440
to show the importance of the meeting.

184
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Mom and Dad...

185
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,960
No, no, no.

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,320
Sir, Ma'am.

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm sorry I'm late.

188
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
Thank you for your patience.

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
This is...

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,040
He's my driver and assistant.

191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,440
And also my cousin, Lin Bufan.

192
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,600
Lin, please have a seat.

193
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,800
You're dressed so nicely. Are you getting engaged today?

194
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,640
Yes, getting engaged today.

195
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,640
Sit down and eat now.

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,920
Rule number 2 for meeting the in-laws:

197
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
Bring matching gifts that appeal to their interests,

198
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,820
to show thoughtful attention to detail.

199
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Yes, exactly.

200
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,600
I've brought some small gifts for you both.

201
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
I heard you enjoy tea,

202
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,400
so I brought you some premium Tieguanyin.

203
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,680
Please try it.

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,240
And I prepared a silk scarf for you, ma'am.

205
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm not sure if you like the style.

206
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm just coming for a simple meal.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,560
Why did you bring so many gifts?

208
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
No, no, no.

209
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,920
Just small things.

210
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,720
It's nothing, just a token of respect.

211
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,640
Lin Bufan.

212
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
What are you up to?

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,120
Brother, I'm sorry.

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,000
I might need to leave first.

215
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,810
Watch how I handle this.

216
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
The third iron rule of meeting the in-laws:

217
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Be proactive and honest, answer more, ask less.

218
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,400
To demonstrate the purity of our family name.

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
No, no.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,040
Uncle.

221
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,160
I'd like to toast you.

222
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,760
For raising such an excellent daughter.

223
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,040
This young man can really hold his liquor.

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
See, he's quite impressive.

225
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,400
My name is Lin Bufan.

226
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,960
The 'Bufan' that means extraordinary.

227
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,160
Yes, your brother mentioned Lin Bufan.

228
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,200
Born in 1997.

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,920
Height 181 cm, weight 140 pounds.

230
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Han ethnicity.

231
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,280
Social status...

232
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Ugly.

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,040
Good.

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,930
But since I was young...

235
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,360
My father passed away.

236
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
No wonder you always think about your father.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,130
Since childhood, my mother told me...

238
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Children from poor families must grow up fast.

239
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Since I was little, my mom...

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,640
Lin Bufan, sit down right now.

241
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,700
Shouldn't I mention this?

242
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,120
I previously worked for some time as...

243
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,800
An electronic sports coaching engineer.

244
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Just a game booster, basically.

245
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,680
Game booster.

246
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,760
Later, to pursue a higher spiritual level...

247
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
And better material life...

248
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I decided...

249
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
To stay by Tonghua's side.

250
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,010
To serve as her right-hand man.

251
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,480
Specifically taking care of her daily needs.

252
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,540
Helping her and also helping myself.

253
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,100
To become a better person.

254
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,200
He damaged my sister's car and couldn't pay for it.

255
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,840
So he's working as a driver to pay off the debt.

256
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,720
Is that so?

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,920
What I'm saying is, no matter what...

258
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm the kind of person...

259
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,600
No matter what profession I'm in...

260
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,760
Whatever job I do...

261
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,920
I'm not afraid of hardship or exhaustion.

262
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,040
I strive for a better married life.

263
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,640
Young people should be like this.

264
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
Like when I was young...

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,320
Alright, alright.

266
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,080
Very good.

267
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,920
I like you.

268
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Lin Bufan

269
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
can you stop embarrassing yourself

270
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
in front of my family?

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Behave yourself,

272
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,440
I'm begging you.

273
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,340
How am I not behaving? Fine, fine.

274
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,440
Everyone, let's eat.

275
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
The food is getting cold. Let's eat.

276
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Come on.

277
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Uncle, have some dessert.

278
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,960
Thank you.

279
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,400
The first time I saw you,

280
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,240
I felt such a connection, like we were meant to meet.

281
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,680
I feel the same way about you.

282
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,200
Come on, dear, let's have a toast.

283
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,600
I didn't invite him here.

284
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,840
See that?

285
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,600
Did you see?

286
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,180
I've got Uncle wrapped around my finger.

287
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,160
Stay away from me.

288
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,560
What's wrong? Blinded by my good looks?

289
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,800
Starting to feel a bit insecure?

290
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Lin Bufan,

291
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,760
your clothes smell of sweat.

292
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,280
Can you please keep your distance?

293
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,480
You'll start to stink if you keep sweating like that.

294
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm dressed for the occasion.

295
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,520
What occasion?

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,920
You're not marrying into the family, why be so formal?

297
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,650
Brother, you just don't get it.

298
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,560
Look at what I'm wearing,

299
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,900
then look at what you're wearing.

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,360
It's inappropriate.

301
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You even came empty-handed.

302
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040
No wonder you and Tongxin haven't made any progress.

303
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
You have the nerve to talk?

304
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,800
If you hadn't acted that way today,

305
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,160
would I have looked

306
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,120
so bad?

307
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,400
What way?

308
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Blaming the good student because you're failing?

309
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
Never mind.

310
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,800
From now on, we'll each do our own thing.

311
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,680
I'll call you brother,

312
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
and you call me brother-in-law.

313
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,520
Brother,

314
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,160
in the future,

315
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,890
you should learn more from your brother-in-law.

316
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I...

317
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,780
What are you doing?

318
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,560
I'll walk you out, uncle.

319
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
I...

320
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,160
Muxing

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
Ziran

322
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,570
Ziran

323
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:12,840
Ke Pengsen
