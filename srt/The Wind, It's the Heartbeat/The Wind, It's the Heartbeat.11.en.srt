1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,760
I, Tong Xin,

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,760
want to be best friends with An Ning for life.

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,200
Forever and ever, may our friendship last.

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,920
An Ning?

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,920
Why is it you?

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,760
Aren't you Tong Xin's best friend?

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,720
Who said she's my friend?

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,760
Besides,

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
there are no forever friends in this world.

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,370
Rather than calling her my friend,

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I'd say

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,960
she is now

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,720
a common enemy to both of us.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,760
This is Tongxin's most precious thing.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,600
I think

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,440
you'll use it

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,120
where it's most needed.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Dr. Wang, your case file.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,479
Good, thank you.

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,610
You're welcome.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,200
Dr. Jiang.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,840
This is Anning's case file.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,400
The director asked if you could take a look at it.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
This young lady's condition

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,920
keeps fluctuating

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,320
and she doesn't cooperate with treatment.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,580
Medication treatment prescription...

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,520
Is there a problem?

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Her?

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
She has some serious issues.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,560
Dr. Jiang,

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,720
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,970
The medical advice says

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,340
you should avoid cold and spicy food.

35
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
I only follow Dr. Jiang's medical advice.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
Try the vanilla flavor.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,760
If you want me to behave,

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,720
then be my attending physician.

39
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
But I have one condition.

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
Starting today,

41
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,960
you cannot appear in front of Tongxin.

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
You cannot disturb her life.

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,240
You cannot affect her emotions.

44
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,920
Why are you making it sound

45
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,600
like I'm the bad guy?

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm the victim here.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
I promise you.

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,120
I have matters to attend to at the hospital.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
I need to go now.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,040
When I was feeling down as a child,

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
I would come here.

52
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,680
Because I grew up in a single-parent family,

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,880
I had to listen to my mom about everything when I was young.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Bufan, what do you want to eat today?

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,840
Bufan, what should you wear today?

56
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,040
I had no say in anything, big or small.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,960
Sometimes I even wondered

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,240
if I was my mother's son

59
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,160
or just her doll.

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,280
I thought things would get better when I grew up.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,240
But now she

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
even wants to meddle in my marriage.

63
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,720
She's already picked out someone for me to marry.

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I couldn't take it anymore,

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,280
so I came back to stay with my brother.

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,400
Who knew her reach would be so long?

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,280
From across

68
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,240
the ocean, she's still sending people to catch me.

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,840
Can you understand that?

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,000
Your mother...

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,960
Stop.

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
Don't give me that

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
'your mother only wants what's best for you' speech.

74
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,959
Do you even believe that?

75
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,240
I'm sick of hearing it.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,800
What I want to say is

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,360
your mother has her perspective,

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,640
and you have yours.

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Conflicts and misunderstandings between people

80
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,600
are completely normal.

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,640
What's most important is

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,360
how you find yourself in all this

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,890
and stay true to who you are.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
Then give me some advice.

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Make money.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
Only when you're financially independent

87
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,170
can you be emotionally weaned.

88
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
So I need to be rich after all.

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
When are you going to give me a raise?

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,360
The company offers raises twice a year.

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,320
It depends on your performance.

92
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
That's strict.

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll do my best.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
What's wrong?

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,680
You're bleeding.

96
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,280
It's nothing. Just put some iodine on it later.

97
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,840
When I was little, my mom

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,480
would treat my small wounds just like this.

99
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
It'll be better soon.

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
Hello everyone, I'm Xiaoxin.

101
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
Today I'm bringing you a song

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
'It's Raining All Over the World'.

103
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,120
I hope you'll enjoy this song.

104
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,480
The sudden downpour.

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,520
Yet I don't want to hide.

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Nowhere to go anyway.

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Remnants everywhere.

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,880
Recording the past

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,320
all about you.

110
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,040
Rain turning the city upside down.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
Hello everyone.

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,200
My name is Tongxin.

113
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm bringing you a song today.

114
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,760
The sudden downpour.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Yet I don't want to hide.

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,840
Nowhere to go anyway.

117
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Remnants everywhere.

118
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
Recording the past.

119
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,880
What's wrong?

120
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
It's so frustrating.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Whenever there's a camera pointing at me

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,040
or a bunch of people watching me,

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,760
my throat feels like it's stuck

124
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,020
and I can't sing at all.

125
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,240
It was the same when I participated

126
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,300
in that campus singing competition.

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,480
You're going to be a big star someday.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,200
You'll have to perform on stage.

129
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
How can you be afraid of cameras?

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,600
By then, not just on stage

131
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,640
but even off stage,

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,970
there will be many cameras following you.

133
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,820
If you're nervous,

134
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
I have a little trick.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,760
Have a mint.

136
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,810
It'll help with the nerves.

137
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,320
I don't want it.

138
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
How would this help?

139
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Just try it.

140
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,809
How does it feel?

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
Cool and refreshing.

142
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,080
It does seem better.

143
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,360
If you're really scared,

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
I can point the camera at you

145
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
but I won't turn it on.

146
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
After you get used to it,

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,040
we can film something, okay?

148
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,920
The sudden downpour.

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,120
Yet I don't want to take shelter.

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,360
There's nowhere for me to go anyway.

151
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Everywhere are remnants.

152
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,360
All memories recorded are about you.

153
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,160
The whole world is raining.

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
I hope you won't get wet.

155
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,720
Nostalgia is a stubborn disease.

156
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,480
I can't help wanting to care for you.

157
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,640
What role must I play to hear your voice again?

158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,440
If memories are this heavy rain.

159
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,640
I still don't want to escape.

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,010
After all, I've already...

161
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,330
What's going on?

162
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,360
Sing!

163
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,920
You forgot the lyrics?

164
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,980
Forgot the lyrics.

165
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,120
Anyway, I have nowhere to go.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,080
Everywhere are remnants.

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,520
All recorded memories are about you.

168
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,400
The heavy rain in this upside-down city.

169
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Has someone replaced me?

170
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,520
No more news from you,

171
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,320
never meeting you again.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Perhaps you've

173
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,000
escaped the gravity of longing.

174
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,480
The whole world is raining.

175
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,960
I still think you're by my side.

176
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,720
Regret has its own inertia,

177
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
I still save half the umbrella for you.

178
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
Last time you said you wanted to isolate yourself to prepare for the album.

179
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,640
How's the preparation going?

180
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
Are you doing okay?

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,080
What is it? Got new work?

182
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,200
No.

183
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm just worried about you.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
Afraid you're keeping things to yourself.

185
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,370
What are you worried about?

186
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,360
Worried I can't sing anymore?

187
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
That's not what I meant.

188
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,960
It's just lately...

189
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
As it turns out,

190
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,200
what you all worry about will never happen.

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,920
What role must I play to hear your voice again?

192
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,960
If memories are this downpour,

193
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,520
I don't want the sky to clear.

194
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,420
Congratulations.

195
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,680
You've been recovering well lately.

196
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,810
This is a small gift.

197
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
Wishing you happiness every day.

198
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,720
I believe it won't be long

199
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,040
before we can hear you singing on stage again.

200
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,920
Thank you.

201
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,200
It's also thanks to your patience in communicating with me

202
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
and listening to what I have to say.

203
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,560
I've been getting to know your work recently.

204
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,640
Now I'm one of your fans.

205
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,680
By the way,

206
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,540
I bought tickets to your concert.

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
You should have told me earlier.

208
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,600
I could have given you front section tickets.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,680
I couldn't possibly accept that.

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,520
I genuinely love your music.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,810
I wonder if you could give me an autograph at the concert?

212
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,120
No problem. That's easy.

213
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
Actually,

214
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,680
we can

215
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,490
open up to each other

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
and talk about anything you want.

217
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,240
There's something recently

218
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
that's been confusing me.

219
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,140
Why don't you tell me about it?

220
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
When I was in high school,

221
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
someone did something that hurt me.

222
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,920
I was very upset

223
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,400
and hated him for a long time.

224
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,280
Until recently when he appeared in my life again

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,840
and suddenly became very nice to me.

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,100
I don't know if he's trying to make amends

227
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
or if it's something else.

228
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm resistant

229
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
yet I can't push him away.

230
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,040
Many times,

231
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,100
hate and love can transform into each other instantly.

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,800
You could say

233
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,280
that hatred is also a form of love.

234
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,760
From what I'm hearing,

235
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,640
I feel like you still care about him,

236
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,400
you're concerned about him,

237
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,930
and that has never changed.

238
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
Maybe.

239
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,280
But I don't want to make the same mistake again.

240
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
You need to face it honestly

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
so you can move on.

242
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,920
Why not carefully consider your true feelings?

243
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
But as Jiang Yinchuan's friend,

244
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,920
I can only tell you

245
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,520
that he's usually a very cold person

246
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,050
and wouldn't act this way toward just anyone.

247
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,290
Who said it was Jiang Yinchuan?

248
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,760
You're always so busy with work

249
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
how come you have time for afternoon tea with me?

250
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,000
I asked you here for work reasons too.

251
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Our company is collaborating with Qingyuan's new scenic area

252
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
on a resort project.

253
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,040
We're looking for someone with the right image and temperament

254
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,000
to be our spokesperson.

255
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,200
I thought you said

256
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
you didn't support my entertainment career,

257
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
but you still think of me when there's an opportunity.

258
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,690
Stop joking around.

259
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,280
I honestly believe that among all the female candidates,

260
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,940
you're the most suitable one.

261
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,560
Good taste.

262
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,480
By the way, tomorrow's Friday.

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,360
You should meet with the shareholders and the scenic area managers

264
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,620
to finalize this deal.

265
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,560
I've sent the address to your phone.

266
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
Don't forget to check it.

267
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,810
It's not confirmed yet.

268
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,000
There's another round of interviews.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,920
Of course.

270
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,840
You're not the only one who wants this endorsement deal.

271
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Who else is there?

272
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,600
Well, there's

273
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,080
that Yiyi you hate so much.

274
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,680
Her?

275
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,200
Alright, prepare yourself well.

276
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I have another meeting. I need to go.

277
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,040
Bye.

278
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
Remember to check it.

279
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,280
The folder.

280
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,240
I haven't deleted it for her yet.

281
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,480
I'll delete it now.

282
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,640
I lost my lyric notebook long ago.

283
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,680
How did it end up with her?

284
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,280
Remember this? I've taken a look at it.

285
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
Many of the songs in it are quite good.

286
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,080
There's one that's not finished yet.

287
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,480
Seems like you wrote it for your first love.

288
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,640
Who gave it to you?

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,440
Do you want it back?

290
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,400
Come get it from me tomorrow.

291
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,760
If you don't want it, I'll burn it.

292
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Ziran

293
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,320
Shouran
