1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,720
I thought you were already in jail.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm currently out on bail pending trial.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,160
You asked me to come today.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,290
Don't tell me you want my forgiveness.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,400
Tongxin.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,460
I sincerely came to apologize to you.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,280
It's actually quite funny.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,740
I've been in this industry for so many years.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,320
Yet when this happened,

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,650
not a single person was willing to help me.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
Even my fans

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,360
disappeared completely at the first sign of trouble.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,160
You broke the law.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
How do you expect others to help you?

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,320
I deserve it, I know.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,000
But Tongxin,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,880
you're also in this industry.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,840
You know that

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,920
in this business,

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
if you don't fight,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
you won't survive.

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,120
In the past, to get ahead,

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,460
I used many underhanded methods.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,200
I did many things that even I despise.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,760
Ending up like this today

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,080
is entirely my own doing.

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,520
Tongxin,

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,039
I asked you to come today

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,440
not to ask for your forgiveness.

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,800
I just want some peace in my heart.

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,200
Whatever punishment the law gives me after this,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,600
I'll accept it.

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,020
I won't forgive you just because you're remorseful

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,440
after deliberately hurting me.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,200
I already anticipated this response from you.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,759
It's okay.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,759
Anyway,

38
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
thank you for being willing to see me today.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
By the way,

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,700
there's one more thing

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,320
I think I should tell you.

42
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,520
What?

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
Do you know who gave me your lyric book?

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,320
Your high school classmate,

45
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
Xu Qin.

46
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,760
You missed such a good opportunity.

47
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,720
I don't know why that Yi Yi

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
is so unreliable.

49
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
I have a good plan

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,180
that will not only destroy her

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,280
but also completely replace her.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,280
Want to hear it?

53
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,480
I want to hear it.

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,760
Of course I do.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,680
Top trending:

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,520
Tong Xin announces breakup with genius doctor Jiang Yinchuan.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,160
It's always like this.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm always the last to know about anything that happens to her.

59
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,360
Does she even consider me

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
as her boss at all?

61
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Don't rush.

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll ask Tong Xin about the situation

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,250
and then arrange PR to manage public opinion.

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Xinxin.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,440
What's going on?

66
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,100
It's exactly what you all saw.

67
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I've broken up with Jiang Yinchuan.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm planning to organize a fan meeting.

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,840
At the fan meeting,

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,600
I will tell my fans

71
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,840
honestly about what I've been through lately.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
And all those things

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,079
I had to hide from them.

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
Isn't this too rushed?

75
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,120
I just don't want to deceive everyone anymore.

76
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
Give me the phone.

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,200
She hung up.

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,960
I didn't even get to ask her anything.

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,930
If everyone's like this, how can I run my company?

80
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,500
I'm going to replace her sooner or later.

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,980
You're right, Mr. Xie.

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,370
Just replace someone who doesn't listen.

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,880
This injury has finally healed.

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Fortunately,

85
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
it didn't damage any nerves.

86
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,880
Otherwise,

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
you wouldn't be able to perform surgery,

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,980
and the medical field would lose a talented person.

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,159
Yinchuan, get well soon.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,880
Good thing your hand is fine.

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,159
When are you planning to go back to work?

92
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,240
I've been waiting for my doctor for a long time.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Anning.

94
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,200
Actually,

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,280
what you need isn't me,

96
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
but a therapist.

97
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
What do you mean?

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,060
I agreed to be your doctor before,

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,720
but it was actually to investigate you.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,500
Your throat has been fine for a while, hasn't it?

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,600
So what?

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,080
I didn't come to you to treat my throat,

103
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
but my heart.

104
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,760
A heart that loves you hopelessly.

105
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
You should know that.

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,340
I've liked you since high school.

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,500
After all these years abroad,

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,690
I've been pursuing you the whole time.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
You and Tongxin are impossible now.

110
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Why can't you turn around and see me?

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,960
You know that

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
holding onto a hopeless relationship

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
is just a pointless struggle.

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Anning.

115
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Let me say it again.

116
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,880
What's between me and Tongxin

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,140
is not for you to judge.

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
And also,

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,240
what we have will never end.

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Do you really like her that much?

121
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,400
How am I not as good as her?

122
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,600
Can't you like me instead?

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Do you really like me?

124
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,960
You should know better than anyone.

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Back in school,

126
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,640
you couldn't stand that Tongxin had someone she liked,

127
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,300
so you spread rumors about me.

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,250
Now she's become a big star,

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,360
and you're even more jealous that she's better than you.

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,620
You're obsessed with bringing her down,

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,920
trying to take everything that belongs to her.

132
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
What do you mean 'take everything that belongs to her'?

133
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,740
Those things were mine to begin with!

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,260
Everything she stole from me.

135
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I will take it all back,

136
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
step by step.

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Please get out of the car.

138
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
Wait.

139
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,320
What's wrong?

140
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
Your favorite brownie cake.

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Do you like it?

142
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,520
Why did you suddenly think of buying cake?

143
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,560
Today is our

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,159
one-month anniversary.

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,920
You forgot?

146
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,560
I didn't forget.

147
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,240
But I worked overtime all day and I'm exhausted.

148
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,330
Let's celebrate another time.

149
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,960
Once today is gone, it's gone.

150
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
There won't be another chance.

151
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,610
Next time is different.

152
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,320
Do you even take me seriously?

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,480
What does our relationship

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
mean to you?

155
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,400
What's going on between you and Jiang Yinchuan?

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
Breaking up suddenly

157
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,730
without even consulting the company.

158
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
We were just pretending to be a couple

159
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
to deal with those online rumors.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,919
Nobody mentions those rumors anymore.

161
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,770
Should I keep him around for the holidays or what?

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,559
That's so ungrateful of you.

163
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,400
Dr. Jiang has been really good to you.

164
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,860
You never truly know someone.

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,160
He was just putting on a good act.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Besides,

167
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,050
I'm busy organizing a fan meeting,

168
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,720
finishing my album,

169
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,320
and preparing for a concert.

170
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,640
I don't have time to play pretend with him.

171
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,760
You could have at least given us a heads-up.

172
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,120
Suddenly seeing your breakup news online

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,040
gave both me and Director Xie a real shock.

174
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,800
I promise

175
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,240
this is the last time.

176
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,520
Fine, you're the boss.

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
What can I do about you?

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,520
I still have to clean up your mess.

179
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,880
When we get to the hospital,

180
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,820
do you want me to come with you?

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,800
No need.

182
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,560
Xuanze is already there waiting for me.

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Besides the breakup,

184
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,290
is there anything else you're hiding from me?

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
After the fan meeting is over,

186
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
you'll know everything.

187
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,080
Xinxin,

188
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,440
how was

189
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,040
your follow-up check?

190
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,170
What did the doctor say? Is it serious?

191
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,960
The doctor said my mental state has improved a lot.

192
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm fine now.

193
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
Xinxin.

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,000
You shouldn't have kept your illness

195
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
from me.

196
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,900
If you had told me earlier,

197
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,560
I could have helped you.

198
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,090
I just didn't want you to worry.

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Besides, it's just a small matter.

200
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
The doctor said I'm recovering well.

201
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,560
I can manage it myself.

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,440
Tongxin.

203
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Actually,

204
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,040
I'd rather be the one who holds an umbrella for you on a rainy day.

205
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,370
The person who shelters you from the rain.

206
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,890
Rather than letting you face the storm alone,

207
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,440
I want to face it together with you.

208
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,040
Dr. Jiang.

209
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,610
Have you had your stitches removed? Is your hand better?

210
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Thanks for your concern.

211
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,160
It's much better now.

212
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,770
That's good to hear.

213
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,640
Dr. Jiang needs to perform surgeries after all.

214
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,240
It would be terrible if his hands were injured.

215
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,960
Xinxin.

216
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,100
Your parents are calling us home for dinner.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,760
Tell them we're done here.

218
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,890
We'll be right back.

219
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,080
Be careful.

220
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,040
The elevator is about to reach the first floor.

221
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Don't be afraid.

222
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,920
I'll contact maintenance to come over now.

223
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Looks like we don't need maintenance after all.

224
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Xinxin, let's go.

225
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,200
Let's head home.

226
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,240
It's really not easy to make plans with a busy person like you.

227
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,520
It's rare that you're willing to come out and have fun.

228
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm not a working machine.

229
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
I need to come out for a breather sometimes.

230
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,920
Besides,

231
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,800
today is the teacher's birthday.

232
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
It's my mentor's birthday,

233
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
I had to come no matter what.

234
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
Indeed.

235
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,140
The teacher has always been good to us students.

236
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,000
Just like earlier,

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,840
the teacher thinks we're both too old to get married.

238
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
He even tried to match us up.

239
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,810
The teacher doesn't know, but I certainly do.

240
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
You're not single.

241
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,600
You have a driver with whom you share a special relationship.

242
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,880
He's just my cousin.

243
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
There's nothing between us.

244
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
You're overthinking it.

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,720
Regardless of whether you two have a relationship or not,

246
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,760
I believe in the end

247
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,560
you won't choose to marry him.

248
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,400
After all, we both understand

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
marriage is not dating.

250
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,400
Marriage

251
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
is more like starting a company together.

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,320
You need a partner with equal capability

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,360
and similar values to run it together.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
You should know

255
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
what kind of partner

256
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,520
suits you better.

257
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,540
That's an interesting perspective.

258
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,160
You think so too?

259
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Then it seems we're on the same page.

260
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,920
Don't worry.

261
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
I've always believed that

262
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,440
marriage is a way of life.

263
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,840
It's a necessity on life's journey.

264
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
But it's not a shackle.

265
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
It shouldn't constrain us.

266
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,760
So after marriage,

267
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,050
we can live our separate lives.

268
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
You don't interfere with me,

269
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
and I won't interfere with you and your cousin.

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
Marriage is not a small matter.

271
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,970
I understand your caution.

272
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,380
You can think about it for a few more days.

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,320
Be careful. Don't catch a cold.

274
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,680
Thanks.

275
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,820
Your cousin is here to pick you up.

276
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,450
Think carefully about my suggestion.

277
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,080
I'll wait for your response.

278
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,210
Hai Qin Yiwen

279
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,160
Ke Gu Peng Hui
