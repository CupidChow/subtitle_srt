1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,650
Jiang Yinchuan, stop right there.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
I need to ask you something.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,360
Why did you suddenly tell my mom

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,290
that you won't be my tutor anymore?

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,520
If you want to improve your grades,

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,120
you can find a better teacher.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,600
There's no one better than you.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
What's gotten into you?

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
It's that simple.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,850
Jiang Yinchuan.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,920
Did I do something wrong?

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,080
Was I too harsh?

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Or is it because

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,200
I ate your snacks and you're upset?

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't want you to be in a bad mood because of me.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
Can you please tell me?

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,400
I just feel

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,200
you're disturbing me.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,330
I'm also at a critical point

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,850
and don't have time for you.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,040
Jiang Yinchuan.

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,540
Are you really abandoning me?

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,600
Did you tell Tong Xin

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,440
about my injury?

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
Why did you hide it from her?

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,960
She hurt both of us.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,759
She should be begging for our forgiveness.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,960
She has nothing to do with this.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,200
I've never blamed her.

31
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,840
You're my attending physician,

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
but your hand is injured.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Who's going to treat my injuries now?

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,890
I've already suggested you find another doctor.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,770
We don't need to be in contact anymore.

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,490
Jiang Yinchuan!

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,560
I don't want to have

38
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,560
anything to do with you.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,970
I don't believe you have no feelings for me at all.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
You're crazy.

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,380
I bet you would come to save me.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,560
This is the deep water area.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,690
People can die here.

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
I know you love me

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,770
and can't bear to let me die.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm a doctor.

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,320
Saving lives is my duty.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,840
I won't save you again next time.

49
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,560
Xin.

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,320
She hates me.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,200
Why can't I like her?

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,500
You must be exhausted these days.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,920
Get some rest.

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,250
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

55
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,079
Your hand injury hasn't healed yet.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
What's wrong?

57
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,079
You've had a long face all the way back.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
Did I upset you again?

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
We're just in a contractual relationship.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,680
Nothing you do affects me.

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,880
Fine.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,400
Let's not talk about these unpleasant things.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Didn't you say you wanted to eat greenling fish?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
I'll go make some for you.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,680
Jiang Yinchuan.

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,930
Let's terminate our contract.

67
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,519
Xinxin.

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,440
This joke of yours

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
isn't funny at all.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm serious.

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,120
The public opinion storm has passed.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,720
My work is back on track.

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,440
So there's no need

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,440
for us to continue fulfilling the contract.

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
Why?

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Weren't we doing fine before?

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,520
You have to give me a reason.

78
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,920
You know the reason very well.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,480
It won't do anyone any good if we fall out.

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
I don't agree.

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,960
Our contract hasn't expired yet.

82
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Contracts can be terminated early.

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
Xinxin.

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Weren't we getting along well on the island?

85
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,080
Why are you acting like a completely different person since we got back?

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Or was it that

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,840
you've been playing me all along?

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240
Me playing you?

89
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,160
Jiang Yinchuan.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,680
I should be the one asking

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,640
what your real purpose was for getting close to me.

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
Was it to make amends?

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,280
Or were you

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,400
trying to make a fool out of me?

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760
That's impossible.

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
The pain you caused me back then

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,040
is deeply carved into my heart.

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,960
No matter what you do

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,380
or how you try to make up for it,

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
it can never be erased.

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Now I'm no longer afraid to sing.

102
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,500
Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,280
From today on,

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
between you and me,

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
all debts and grudges

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,760
are wiped clean.

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,970
Neither of us owes the other anything.

108
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,760
I hope you can pack your things soon

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,410
and move out of my house.

110
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
My being by your side

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,160
was never just about atonement.

112
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,720
Tong Xin.

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,200
Tell me.

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,480
What do I need to do

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,120
to make you truly happy?

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Jiang Yinchuan.

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,320
I'm not the same person I used to be.

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,920
Foolishly deceived by all of you.

119
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Having you by my side

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,000
is the source of my pain.

121
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,320
I don't want to see you again.

122
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,520
Come.

123
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
Try the coffee I made.

124
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,600
It's definitely better than what they serve in cafés.

125
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,400
I didn't know you had this skill.

126
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,440
You underestimated me, didn't you?

127
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
Try it.

128
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,200
How is it?

129
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
Lin Bufan.

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,960
I drove all the way to bring you home.

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,760
And you serve me instant coffee?

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,600
The coffee may be instant.

133
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,880
But my feelings for you

134
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
are not instant.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,120
This is all my brother has.

136
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,360
No life here.

137
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,210
It's like a showroom. Everything's missing.

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,800
Just make do for now.

139
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,200
Tomorrow

140
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'll treat you to something better.

141
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,880
Do you plan to stay here forever?

142
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,680
To avoid my mom,

143
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,480
I have to rough it for a while.

144
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,480
I've been working all day.

145
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm so tired.

146
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,760
Want to try

147
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,720
the Lin family's secret relaxation technique?

148
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,370
Gentle, please.

149
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
Gentle. A bit lower.

150
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Lower.

151
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,930
Does that feel good?

152
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
Should I press harder?

153
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
Lower.

154
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
A bit lower.

155
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
Why didn't you say hello when you came back?

156
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,330
It's pretty awkward, don't you think?

157
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,360
He must have been kicked out by Xinxin.

158
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,440
Your brother probably got dumped.

159
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
You should comfort him.

160
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
What's wrong with you?

161
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,880
You two seemed fine before.

162
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Stuck together like glue every day.

163
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,520
Why the sudden breakup?

164
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
That's not how emotions work.

165
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,400
Weren't you

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,880
the one who wanted us to break up?

167
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,520
That was then.

168
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,400
Now

169
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,680
I'm being ridiculous.

170
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,120
What?

171
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,690
You really don't go online, do you?

172
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,720
What I mean is, compared to all that other nonsense,

173
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
I'd rather see you happy.

174
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
When you're happy,

175
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,280
I can be happy too.

176
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
But if I'm happy,

177
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,080
she won't be happy.

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,240
Why isn't she happy then?

179
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,480
Is she just in a bad mood or

180
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,920
did someone upset her?

181
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
I know you love me.

182
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,250
You can't bear to let me die.

183
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,520
What's your purpose for coming to me?

184
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,880
Is it to make amends?

185
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
Or are you

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,080
trying to play me like a fool?

187
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,600
It's An Ning.

188
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,480
Stop overthinking.

189
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
When it comes to love,

190
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
don't think too much.

191
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,880
Just go for it.

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
If nothing else works,

193
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,720
get on your knees and beg her.

194
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,400
You can afford not to think so much.

195
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,280
I can't.

196
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Why not?

197
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,920
Because I hurt her.

198
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Jiang Yinchuan

199
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,530
When are you going back?

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,800
Now.

201
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Is there something you need?

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
I have something to tell you.

203
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,050
Jiang Yinchuan,

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,680
I like you.

205
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,080
I know.

206
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,320
Xinxin.

207
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,160
This is your favorite mouthwash.

208
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
I've prepared enough for three months.

209
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,940
The rest are in the storage cabinet in the utility room.

210
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,330
When you run out, remember to ask Song Yue to restock for you.

211
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,370
Get up early.

212
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,680
And drink less cola.

213
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,080
The fruits and vegetables

214
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
have all been organized.

215
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,920
This is the greenling fish you love.

216
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,680
I've put it on the top shelf of the refrigerator.

217
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,960
Don't forget to eat it.

218
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,880
I've washed and dried your clothes from the past few days.

219
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm not sure if I hung them in the right place.

220
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,440
If you don't like it,

221
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,490
you can make some adjustments.

222
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,440
Zong Dingwen

223
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
Ziran

224
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,890
Ziran

225
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Keying Pengben
