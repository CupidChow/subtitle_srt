1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,880
Sis, there's nothing to explain.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,320
It's exactly what you saw.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Don't worry.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,250
Just leave it to me and the company.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,360
I can't trust you to handle this.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,720
Who was it that told me they were cutting ties with Jiang Yinchuan

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,520
and never speaking to him again?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
Why are you bringing this up?

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,680
The current situation is forced by circumstances.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,479
We have no choice.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,240
What circumstances?

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,160
At first,

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,690
Xingmeng Entertainment was eager to clear up Xinxin's rumors,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,200
so they came up with this plan.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,920
I was considering Xinxin's condition.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,290
Dr. Jiang, look at the time.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,620
You should get to work.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
Work.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,960
Today I

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,280
really need to go to work.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,760
You two can talk.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm heading to work now.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,080
He has no time to explain.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Go ahead then.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,200
It's nothing serious.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
Those people out there believe every rumor they hear.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,039
They take a few photos and make up wild stories.

28
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,320
The company only took this measure for my sake.

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't worry, sis. I can handle this myself.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,240
Really?

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,120
Of course! Who am I?

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
I'm Tong Xin, the queen of the music industry.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,039
This little media storm

34
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,500
could never bring me down.

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
Besides, Jiang Yinchuan is just my shield.

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,920
Once I've used him to calm the public opinion,

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,320
I'll kick him to the curb.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,360
After how he treated me back then,

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,920
don't I deserve to get even?

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,400
Do you really need to maintain this relationship with Jiang Yinchuan?

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,880
He's not that poor boy anymore.

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,160
Don't fall for him again.

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
The tables have turned.

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
I've got him wrapped around my finger now.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Don't worry, sis.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
I won't make the same mistake twice.

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
Xin Xin, I'll trust you this once.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,000
If within three months,

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
you can handle this situation,

50
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,440
I won't interfere.

51
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,400
But if you can't,

52
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
If I can't do it, I'll quit the industry

53
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,720
and pack my bags to go home.

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,440
Xin Xin, where are you?

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
I need some time alone.

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,040
Director Dai's new film 'Make Way for the Princess'

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
is about to be promoted.

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,960
The contract for this theme song has been signed.

59
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,520
If we don't record it soon, it'll be too late.

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,680
Okay, I got it.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Just let me know when you've scheduled the recording.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm An Ning. I'm Tong Xin.

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,600
We'll debut together,

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
become music superstars,

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
and be famous all over the country.

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,040
An An.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Isn't Anyang Entertainment pretty good?

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,079
Why did you refuse when they wanted to sign you?

69
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,320
We're a duo.

70
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
How could they sign just me?

71
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
If it weren't for me,

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
she wouldn't have become like this.

73
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
An An.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,440
We meet again.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,720
All these years, I've been sending you messages,

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,920
but I couldn't reach you.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,200
About what happened before,

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm really sorry.

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,079
I never meant to hurt you.

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,940
You're going to the hospital, right?

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,780
If you're going to see An Ning,

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
I advise you not to go.

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
Why?

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,420
I want to have a good talk with her.

85
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,020
She's very emotionally unstable right now.

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,170
If you suddenly appear before her,

87
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,040
it might be like last time.

88
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
She might harm herself

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,560
and others.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
But...

91
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,880
I want to see her.

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
But does she want to see you?

93
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
I know you're upset.

94
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,840
But in this situation,

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
you both need some time.

96
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,140
It's better to meet after everyone has calmed down.

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
Don't you think?

98
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
If there's any news about her,

99
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,200
let me know immediately.

100
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her.

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
Would you like me to give you a ride?

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
No, thanks.

103
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,480
You haven't finished your shift yet, Dr. Jiang.

104
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
I can get back on my own.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't want to wear these ugly clothes.

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,520
Where is Jiang Yinchuan? Tell him to come see me right away.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,920
Miss An, please calm down. Go away. Go away.

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
Dr. Jiang, Miss An has been looking for you.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,520
Everyone, please leave.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,380
You finally came to see me.

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
I knew you would come.

112
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,410
Why did you suddenly come back?

113
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,000
What about you?

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,250
Why did you come back again?

115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,360
How is that any of your business?

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,330
I know even if you don't tell me.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,760
We have the same purpose.

118
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,480
It's all for Tong Xin.

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,120
Right?

120
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,480
After all these years,

121
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,000
you refuse to move on.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
Please don't drag others down

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,480
into this quagmire with you.

124
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,040
We're not children anymore.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,730
What do you mean by 'quagmire'?

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
If I'm not doing well,

127
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,020
she shouldn't expect to be happy either.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I won't let anyone

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,560
hurt Xin Xin again.

130
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,159
Jiang Yinchuan, don't regret this.

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
This is the place. No doubt about it.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Xinxin.

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,880
How are you feeling today?

134
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,960
Don't be stressed.

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,400
I have to do it even if I'm stressed.

136
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,120
The concert is coming up soon.

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
I need to get the new song ready quickly.

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
I can't disappoint my little fans.

139
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
Have some water.

140
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
I'll go say hello first.

141
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
Sound engineer.

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,380
Morning. I'm feeling good today.

143
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Besides, my sister is back from her business trip.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,520
She knows everything that's been happening lately.

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,800
She wants me to quit the industry.

146
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
How could I agree to that?

147
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,640
So with this recording session,

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,440
I need to prove my superstar abilities once again.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Xinxin, are you ready?

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
Let's get started.

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Cobblestone street, a slant of sunset light

152
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,400
drifting away.

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,240
Why should you be the one singing?

154
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,970
Why do you get to stand on stage?

155
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,800
Everything you have now

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,480
should have been mine.

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
You stole my life.

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,720
Your singing is a curse

159
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
that only brings pain to others.

160
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
Brings pain.

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
Xinxin, what's wrong?

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
You look terrible.

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,800
You're not in good shape today.

164
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,160
It's okay. Let's record another day.

165
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
It's fine.

166
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,880
Let me try again.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
I can do it.

168
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
Qingshi Street.

169
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Yue.

170
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,080
I found her.

171
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,960
Don't worry.

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Xinxin.

173
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
It's going to rain.

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Drinking in the cold wind will make you sick.

175
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,880
Why is it you again?

176
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800
You're so annoying.

177
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
Xinxin.

178
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,570
Everyone is worried about you.

179
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Let's go home.

180
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,240
Go away.

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
What right do you have to tell me what to do?

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,520
Who do you think you are?

183
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Jiang Yinchuan.

184
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,880
I can't sing.

185
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,640
I'm a singer who can't sing.

186
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,040
You're here to laugh at me, aren't you?

187
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
It's funny, isn't it?

188
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,330
What gives you the right to laugh at me?

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
What qualifies you?

190
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
I just feel sorry for you.

191
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,600
Feel sorry for me?

192
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,280
She was right.

193
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
Everything I have is stolen.

194
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,120
This is my punishment.

195
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,040
My singing voice

196
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,480
is a curse

197
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,480
that only brings pain to others.

198
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
Listen to me, Tongxin.

199
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,640
Your singing has never been a curse.

200
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
And it has never brought anyone pain.

201
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,760
Xinxin, be good.

202
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,760
Let go of all the unhappy things.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,160
Okay?

204
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Let's go home.

205
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
For me,

206
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,640
your singing is a unique redemption.

207
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,280
Xinxin,

208
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
is your fever any better?

209
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,600
Much better.

210
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,930
Otherwise my parents wouldn't let me out.

211
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
It's all my fault. If my fever hadn't persisted yesterday,

212
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
we should have left yesterday.

213
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Then we'd have more time to prepare.

214
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
It's fine.

215
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,200
Your parents were just worried about your health.

216
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,440
Besides, we've rehearsed so many times.

217
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,170
What else do we need to prepare?

218
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,700
Ding Wen, Wei Yanfeng.

219
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,520
Zi Ran.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,400
Zi Ran.

221
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,280
Zi Ran.

222
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,280
Keding Temple.
