1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,280
I'm finally back in the country.

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,160
I'm free now.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
All my secret savings

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
went to buying the plane ticket.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,060
I don't even have money for a taxi.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,520
Still 15 kilometers to go.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Lin Bufan.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,800
You can do this.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,480
Come on.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,800
I didn't notice.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Really didn't see it.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,880
Mr. Tong, the scratch on the car door is long and deep.

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,200
It's damaged the primer coat.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Um, I'm really sorry.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,620
I truly apologize.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
I honestly didn't see it.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
I'll pay for the repairs.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
But not right now.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,040
I'm a bit short on cash.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Could I add your WeChat first?

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,680
I'll transfer it to you later.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,080
Oh really? And you say it wasn't on purpose?

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't worry, Ms. Tong. I'll handle this.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,560
You thirsty guys

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,320
deliberately causing accidents

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,240
just to get Ms. Tong's WeChat.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
Do you know what a hassle it is to repair a car?

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,120
Who are you calling thirsty?

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,560
I don't even know any Ms. Tong.

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
Stop talking nonsense!

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400
You know the truth in your heart.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,440
Why are you arguing with someone like him?

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,120
Don't worry about him paying for the small repair cost.

35
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,760
I need to go now. I have something to do.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,560
Okay.

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,240
What kind of person? What kind of person am I?

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,570
What kind of person am I?

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,520
What kind of person? What do you mean?

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,400
What kind of person am I?

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,280
Tell me clearly.

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,479
You rude lady.

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,210
I can afford to pay for this.

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Stop right there!

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,680
Just you wait!

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
Stop!

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,720
Come back!

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,800
Drink slowly.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,640
You'll get stomach cramps drinking like that.

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,050
Do you have more?

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Give me another bucket.

52
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Stop, stop, stop.

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,880
I know you're thirsty,

54
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,079
but hold on for a moment.

55
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,040
Excuse me, who are you?

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,000
Who am I?

57
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,160
I'm his brother.

58
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,880
He's my brother.

59
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,079
My mom is his aunt.

60
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,960
His mom is my aunt.

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,680
We're blood relatives.

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,040
Legitimate cousins.

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,000
Alright, alright.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,079
I know you spent plenty of time

65
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,400
on those kiddie rides outside the supermarket.

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,280
Let's not waste time on this nonsense.

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
I'm asking you,

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,290
why did you suddenly come back?

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,280
To rebel against my mother's tyranny.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,160
To embrace freedom.

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,880
I've resolutely returned

72
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,480
to the embrace of my motherland.

73
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,880
Speak plainly.

74
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,280
I ran away from my wedding, bro.

75
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,640
What?

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Ran away?

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,060
Lin Bufan, how old are you now?

78
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,800
Still pulling these running-away stunts.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,160
You didn't bring anything with you.

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,200
What if something happens? What would your mom do?

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,880
I brought it.

82
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,760
I ran into a strange woman.

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,730
She made me lose my luggage.

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,520
Then why did you suddenly appear

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,720
in my trunk?

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,079
I just wanted to surprise you.

87
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,520
Who knew once I got in,

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,000
I'd see you two lovebirds.

89
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
You two.

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,160
Perfect couple.

91
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
Bitch.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
If Jiang Yinchuan hadn't stopped you today,

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,440
you'd be either in jail or in the hospital.

94
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,360
So what?

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,600
Even if I ended up in the morgue today,

96
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,160
I'd still jump up and say

97
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,360
I don't approve of this marriage,

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
and I'll never accept you as my sister-in-law.

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
Who needs your approval?

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,410
Jiang Yinchuan,

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
get your idiot relative out of here now.

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Come back.

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,640
Glare at me again and I'll...

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
Why are you provoking her?

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
I wouldn't dare provoke her.

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,770
She's the one provoking me.

107
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Take this.

108
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Go rest at my place first.

109
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
What's this?

110
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
A digital lock.

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,640
I'll send you the password on WeChat later.

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
I don't have the address either.

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
I'll send that to you as well.

114
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,520
Wait, bro.

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,170
Aren't you coming back?

116
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,920
I'm not going back yet.

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,520
Bro, are you...

118
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,780
Have you married into her family?

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,240
Bro, you've fallen so low.

120
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
You've become a woman's plaything.

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,760
Is your body even up for this?

122
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,420
Don't you ever watch the news?

123
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,340
That woman has so much dirt on her.

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
Shut up!

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,240
Don't let her hear you.

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,520
Go home and get some rest.

127
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
Text me when you wake up.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll take you somewhere nice to eat.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,480
Bro, I have no respect for you.

130
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,760
Close the door behind you.

131
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,920
How could I become

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,360
a kept man for my brother's woman?

133
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,220
Didn't you hear me?

134
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
All those hair growth serums,

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,880
special combs and shampoos,

136
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,120
none of them work.

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,600
The cruelest truth in the world

138
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,680
is that even female celebrities lose their hair.

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,120
My hair...

140
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,000
Jiang Yinchuan, what are you doing?

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,120
Who let you in?

142
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
Didn't I tell you

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,730
not to show up in front of me?

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,570
The door wasn't locked.

145
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,240
I thought you forgot to turn off the lights.

146
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Besides,

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,280
it's my shower time now.

148
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,640
Aren't you leaving?

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,770
Go ahead and shower.

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
This is my house.

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,920
I'll stay wherever I want.

152
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,450
It's none of your business.

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,760
Fair enough.

154
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,490
Jiang Yinchuan, you...

155
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,780
Why are you undressing so slowly?

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,250
Trying to seduce me?

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,240
Don't waste your effort.

158
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,159
I've seen this kind of scene many times.

159
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
With what little you have to offer? Please.

160
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
Pervert.

161
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,020
If you've got the guts, keep undressing.

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,970
If you don't strip completely,

163
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
you're not even a man.

164
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,680
Still so stubborn.

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,280
What are you doing?

166
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Are you planning

167
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
to be stuck here all night?

168
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,000
Dr. Jiang, can you handle this or not?

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Aren't you supposed to be good with surgical knives?

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,130
How come you can't even use nail clippers?

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
Well,

172
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,810
I'll need more practice with this.

173
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
Seriously,

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,520
why did you reach into the drain?

175
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,450
Mind your own business.

176
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,720
Fine, I won't.

177
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,520
But are you planning to stay stuck until tomorrow?

178
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,700
Were you trying to retrieve hair?

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

180
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
How could I possibly be losing hair?

181
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Okay,

182
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,440
the drain grew the hair itself.

183
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,640
Happy now?

184
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,280
From now on, this kind of work,

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,400
let me handle it.

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,540
Didn't you say that doing housework in this home

187
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,800
is my duty?

188
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,160
Smart of you to realize that.

189
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,640
By the way,

190
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,640
that psychologist I recommended to you last time,

191
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,300
when are you going to see them?

192
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
How many times do I have to tell you?

193
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,960
I don't have any psychological issues.

194
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,700
What are you doing?

195
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,970
Are you trying to get physical with me?

196
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,760
In the future, when you're in the room,

197
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,360
don't walk barefoot so much.

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
You'll easily catch cold,

199
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,920
which is bad for your throat.

200
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,540
You put them on backwards.

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
Idiot.

202
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,320
Such a pretender.

203
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't touch me.

204
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,660
No matter how you treat me,

205
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,520
I'll gladly accept it.

206
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Because

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
I owe you.

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
Late again by 10 minutes.

209
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
I just finished dinner

210
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,560
and had a chat with my mom.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
Have you eaten?

212
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes.

213
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,800
You've eaten.

214
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,640
But I saw you ride away right after school.

215
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,680
Where did you eat?

216
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,040
Take a look at this.

217
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,880
I've prepared past college entrance exam questions for you.

218
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
Try solving them.

219
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,980
How do I solve this one?

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,260
You can't even do the first question?

221
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
You know very well

222
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,120
that I'm not good at physics.

223
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,640
Look here.

224
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,440
This question...

225
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
According to Newton's First Law...

226
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
Which of the following statements is correct?

227
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
A: We discussed objects not under force.

228
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,200
Read the question.

229
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,840
Look at option B.

230
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Force is what maintains an object's state of motion.

231
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,520
Now try it yourself.

232
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,080
A great teacher indeed produces excellent students.

233
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,360
My physics skills

234
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,400
have made a quantitative breakthrough tonight.

235
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,800
You're using the wrong term.

236
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,280
It's a qualitative leap.

237
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
Whatever.

238
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,400
After all this mental work,

239
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm getting hungry.

240
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,610
Mr. Jiang, could you make me some noodles?

241
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,080
My cooking is terrible.

242
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,040
I don't believe you. Let me taste it and see.

243
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,560
But I have one condition.

244
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
You need to solve this problem

245
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,760
within fifteen minutes,

246
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,770
and I'll make you some noodles.

247
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I'll definitely complete the task.

248
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
The noodles are ready. Try them.

249
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,160
Be careful, it's hot.

250
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
It's so bland.

251
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,130
It really tastes terrible.

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,180
I don't like it.

253
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Take it away.

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,520
Well.

255
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,740
Just throw it away.

256
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,920
Don't do that. It's such a waste.

257
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,280
Why don't you eat it instead?

258
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,640
You don't have to do this.

259
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't understand what you're saying.

260
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,050
I'm so tired. I'm going upstairs to sleep.

261
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,760
You're awake.

262
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,880
Breakfast will be ready soon.

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,210
What are you doing here?

264
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,720
I need an explanation.

265
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,320
Ziran.

266
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,600
Ziran.
