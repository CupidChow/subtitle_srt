1
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,960
The water clock ticks as mist lightens the window,

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,620
Green lamp and jade brush stand ready at my desk.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
Crafting words and phrases, plowing fields of ink.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,960
Moonlight prints between verses where plum shadows thin,

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,159
Wind caresses the jade flute, its soul whispers light.

6
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,820
Years spent in study, seeking scholarly glory.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,320
A lone traveler crossing thousands of miles,

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,560
Why fear the rain that lies ahead?

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,840
As long as we dare to try,

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,680
And boldly take the first step.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,920
We'll discover that

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,760
Many things aren't as difficult as we imagine.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,720
Fear is a reaction.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,360
Courage is a decision.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
Jiang Yinchuan.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,520
I like you.

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,360
I can feel it.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
You like me too, don't you?

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,440
Don't bother me anymore.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
You're being

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,280
so cheap.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
So that's Tong Xin, the sophomore boss.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,360
What boss?

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,760
She's just Jiang's lapdog.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,680
Jiang didn't even turn off his mic when rejecting her.

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,720
So what if he's her family driver?

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,120
She was the one confessing to Jiang Yinchuan in the broadcast room just now.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,520
But Jiang Yinchuan likes her best friend instead.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,600
It's disgusting. Acting so close with An Ning on the surface,

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,530
while trying to steal her boyfriend behind her back.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
You're awake.

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
How are you feeling?

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
The doctor said you fainted due to extreme stress.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,290
Are you feeling better now?

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
You little troublemaker.

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,320
Do you know what people are saying about you online?

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
See for yourself.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,800
If you had answered my call yesterday,

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
and discussed this with me,

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
we wouldn't be in such a passive position now.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,360
Your concert is coming up soon.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,560
What should we do about this situation?

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Xinxin, you've never been like this before.

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,370
What's really going on?

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,440
Is your throat injured?

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,260
I'm too exhausted lately.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
I'm not in a good mood either.

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,120
I don't want to work.

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,680
Please help me reschedule all my appointments.

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,120
I want to isolate myself

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
and focus

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
on revising my concert album.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Those appointments were scheduled in advance.

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,320
They've already paid deposits.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,240
How can we just cancel everything?

56
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
Oh dear, we—

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Director Xie.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,700
Maybe we should listen to Xinxin.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,840
After all, the concert is the most important thing right now.

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,520
It might be good for her to focus in isolation.

61
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
It's a perfect chance to lay low

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,450
until this wave of public opinion blows over.

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,680
Fine.

64
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Xinxin, get some good rest.

65
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,880
We'll be going now.

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Let's go.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,810
Remember to go to the hospital for your follow-up tomorrow.

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
Anan.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,760
Finally seeing you again.

70
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,200
Anan.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,900
When did you come back to the country?

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,200
What's wrong?

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
Don't want to see me?

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,800
How could that be?

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,610
After what happened back then,

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,519
I've been trying to contact you.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
I sent you so many messages

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
and made so many calls,

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,400
but you never responded.

81
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,480
You ruined my life.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right.

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,120
I am that rat in the gutter you talked about.

84
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
I've been watching your life from the shadows.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,480
But everything you have now

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
should have been mine.

87
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,880
You've become a big star now.

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,440
You're living the high life, collecting awards everywhere.

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,120
And you have the nerve to ask me how I'm doing.

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,159
Do you know?

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Every song you sing now,

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
every lyric, every melody,

93
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
is a knife killing me.

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,760
All your achievements

95
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,680
were built on my flesh and blood.

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,100
It's not like that.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,280
Get out! I don't want to see you! I don't!

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
Tong Xin in another scandal:

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,960
Intimate behavior with greasy 50-year-old tycoon,

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,890
Pair photographed entering hotels multiple times.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Where do they dig up all this old dirt?

102
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,720
That happened ages ago.

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,880
And they still bring it up.

104
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,210
That greasy 50-year-old man is my father.

105
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,330
Who else would he support if not me?

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Then I'll issue a statement to clarify.

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,480
The headline will read:

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
'Tong Family Heiress Ventures into Entertainment'

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,680
No.

110
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
When I debuted, I promised my sister

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
not to reveal our family situation.

112
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
The public opinion is extremely unfavorable to you now.

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
If we don't find a way to divert attention,

114
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,960
your career will be completely ruined.

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,480
There's only one solution now.

116
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,340
Xinxin, you need to date someone.

117
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
You must be joking.

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
I haven't dated anyone in my ten years since debut.

119
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,810
Where would I find a boyfriend now?

120
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,520
I don't mean a real relationship.

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,760
Just pretend.

122
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,840
If you want to suppress this scandal about being kept by a rich businessman,

123
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
you need to release even bigger news.

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,440
Fight fire with fire.

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Yes, exactly.

126
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,960
People nowadays don't care about the truth.

127
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,159
They just want gossip.

128
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,020
No matter how you clarify, nobody will believe you.

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,320
Look, I've always done everything your way before,

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,159
but this time you really can't be so stubborn anymore.

131
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,520
Look at my dark circles.

132
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,200
And look at Director Xie's.

133
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,280
Look, look, look.

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,040
The company has been incredibly busy

135
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,040
preparing for your concert.

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,680
The PR team

137
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,800
has been working overtime to manage public opinion for you.

138
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
Please have some mercy on us

139
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,010
and stop making everyone worry so much, okay?

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,920
Fine.

141
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,810
I'll date him for one month.

142
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,840
One month isn't enough.

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,800
That's too short.

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,930
At least six months.

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,520
You don't need to post about it every day.

146
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,880
Just check in occasionally when you have time.

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Xinxin.

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,320
Three months.

149
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,450
Let's meet halfway. Can't be any less.

150
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,360
Fine. We'll break up after three months.

151
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,980
What are you all doing?

152
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,280
No noise in the hospital.

153
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,000
Hurry up! Follow me! Quick!

154
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's go! We need to run!

155
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
What are you doing?

156
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm warning you.

157
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
Your behavior right now

158
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,560
is seriously disturbing the patients' rest.

159
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,620
If you don't leave,

160
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,770
I'll call the police to arrest you.

161
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,120
Let's go. Come on. Go.

162
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,980
Everyone get back to work. It's over.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,520
You're fine too.

164
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,040
Pretty clever.

165
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,520
How did you recognize me?

166
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
Me? Tong Xin?

167
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,360
You recognized me even though I'm all covered up.

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Tell me, are you my fan?

169
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Aixin.

170
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,580
Thanks for your help just now, little Aixin.

171
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Remember to keep it a secret.

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,560
Didn't I just give you an autograph?

173
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,080
Why are you still following me?

174
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
I'm warning you.

175
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,960
If you keep sticking to me,

176
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
Hey! Hey!

177
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
I wasn't finished speaking.

178
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,680
My fans are truly excellent.

179
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,300
Your examination shows no issues at all.

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,860
Then why can't I sing anymore?

181
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,120
There's no physical abnormality in your throat.

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,200
The first time

183
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,320
you lost your voice while singing,

184
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,280
the most likely cause

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
is psychological.

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,170
That's impossible.

187
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
My mental health is perfectly fine.

188
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
Jiang Yinchuan

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
Jiang Yinchuan

190
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
I like you.

191
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,000
I know.

192
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,360
So let's be together.

193
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
I can feel it.

194
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,680
You like me too, don't you?

195
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Otherwise, why are you so nice to me?

196
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,080
Helping me with my studies and my singing.

197
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,480
Also because...

198
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
Also because my father is your family's driver.

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,800
I can't afford to offend Miss Tong.

200
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,440
Then why do you keep my hair tie

201
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,000
on your wrist?

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,480
You're not the only one with this hair tie.

203
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
An Ning has one too.

204
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,650
I thought you two didn't get along?

205
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,360
How is that possible?

206
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,480
She hates me,

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,160
but why can't I like her?

208
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,840
I know you two are good friends,

209
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,040
but you really don't compare to her at all.

210
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,020
Stop bothering me from now on.

211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,120
You're being

212
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,480
so cheap.

213
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,400
What are you two doing?

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
The whole school can hear you.

215
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,620
You turned on the microphone.

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,000
Jiang Yinchuan.

217
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,260
You hurt me so badly back then,

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,200
I've remembered it for all these years.

219
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
Now

220
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,100
you dare to come back to the country acting like nothing happened.

221
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
I thought we would never see each other again.

222
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,520
But I never expected

223
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
that you would

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,880
dare to show up in front of me like this.

225
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
Mr. Jiang.

226
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll take you somewhere fun.

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,200
Let's go.

228
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,840
I wonder how you've been

229
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
all these years.

230
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,160
Hey, bro. You're back in China.

231
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,520
What do you want?

232
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,610
Did you get into trouble again?

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
My mom wants to arrange a marriage for me,

234
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,680
and the woman is several years older than me!

235
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,080
You have to save me!

236
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,640
I can't help you with this.

237
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
If you don't like it, tell your aunt yourself.

238
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
She won't listen to me.

239
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,600
Anyway,

240
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
I'd rather die than marry an older woman.

241
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't be so absolute,

242
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
or you might regret it later.

243
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,040
Then do you

244
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,680
regret it?

245
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,720
Ziran

246
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,450
Leran

247
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:10,560
Shouren
