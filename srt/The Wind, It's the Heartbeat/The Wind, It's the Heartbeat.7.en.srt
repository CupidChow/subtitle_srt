1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,000
Go ahead and eat.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,960
I won't eat.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,040
How could this happen?

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,440
That's way too arrogant.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,740
I wonder where Xu Qin is right now.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,480
She's back.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,800
Are you okay?

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,200
What's wrong?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,440
We all know Tong Xin bullied you.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,920
That rich young lady must be difficult to get along with.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,520
I just feel she looks down on people.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,580
Now she's even bullying classmates.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,240
They used to treat me like I was invisible.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,280
But now,

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,320
because of this incident,

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,520
they're all around me showing concern.

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
What exactly happened between you and Tongxin?

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,200
Did she really bully you?

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Don't blame Tongxin.

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,280
It's my fault.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
You're the victim.

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,400
How could it be your fault?

23
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
If anyone's to blame, it's Tongxin.

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,800
Don't make accusations before knowing the facts.

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,000
I believe in Tongxin.

26
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,840
Tong Xin is here.

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,040
Xin Xin.

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,160
Here comes the bully.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you so arrogant about?

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,080
There are so many classmates here.

31
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
You dare to hit me?

32
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,760
What's wrong? Come on, hit me.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,640
Xin Xin, I've let you down.

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,560
It's all my fault for being incompetent.

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,039
I was out of my mind.

36
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,039
But there was really no other choice.

37
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,080
We signed a contract for that theme song.

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,880
We saw you weren't feeling well.

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,840
So we thought you should take a break.

40
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,640
I've already said, I don't accept ghost singers.

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,800
You're destroying your own reputation by doing this.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,720
The tenth anniversary concert is coming up soon.

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520
It should be my gift to the fans.

44
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,000
There absolutely cannot be anyone else's voice in it.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,200
Xin Xin, you know the current situation.

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,720
Using a ghost singer was our only option.

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,400
It's also the only solution.

48
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,400
Yes, this is very common in the industry.

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,840
And nowadays many vocals are generated by AI.

50
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,440
It doesn't even matter if you sing it yourself.

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,120
This was an emergency situation.

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,440
We were just too rushed.

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,080
That's why we thought of using a ghost singer.

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,320
But this is truly the best solution

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
we could come up with.

56
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,100
We're only thinking of your best interests.

57
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,360
I promise you

58
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,760
this will be the only time we use a ghost singer.

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,160
There won't be a next time.

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,040
Yes, and that girl who sang for you

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,079
is your fan.

62
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,160
She really likes you.

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,560
Don't worry about keeping her quiet.

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,090
The company will handle it.

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Tongxin, long time no see.

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
Do you remember me?

67
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
We were high school classmates.

68
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,800
You were the star of our school back then.

69
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Xinxin, are you okay?

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
While I was just nobody.

71
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,200
But I've always admired you so much.

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Now that I can be your singing voice,

73
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,000
to help you,

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm really happy.

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,440
Xu Qin, you're doing this on purpose,

76
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,780
deliberately trying to upset me.

77
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
Tongxin.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,760
Are you still angry about that misunderstanding from high school?

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,440
Stop pretending.

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,680
It was all my fault.

82
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,560
Tong Xin.

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
I know you're still upset with me.

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
I apologize to you.

85
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,120
Tong Xin.

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,760
I only wanted to be friends with you back then.

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,440
I didn't expect you to reject me.

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,600
Hello. What would you like?

89
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,360
How much is this?

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,440
This is 15.

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,760
I'll take this.

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
Xin Xin.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,580
I noticed you didn't eat much at lunch today.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,860
I got you a durian mille-feuille.

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
No, thanks.

96
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,250
I already bought it for you.

97
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,280
Last time in PE class, I almost fainted from low blood sugar.

98
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,340
And you gave me some candy, remember?

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I've been wanting to thank you.

100
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,250
I'd like to be friends with you.

101
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,240
No need to thank me. Being friends is fine.

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,040
But I don't eat durian.

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,000
Just eat it.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
I bought it all for you. No, no, no.

105
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,890
I really don't want any.

106
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,159
Let me wipe it.

108
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,840
I just wanted to be friends with you.

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,180
Why are you treating me like this?

110
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,920
Are you like the other students?

111
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
Looking down on me?

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,080
I don't. I don't think that way.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I thought if I didn't clear up this misunderstanding,

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,880
I could get my classmates' understanding and attention.

115
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,480
I was just confused.

116
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
My mother has passed away.

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,960
My father is the only family I have left.

119
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,520
I really need this money for his treatment.

120
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,920
I know you have a kind heart.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,980
When Jiang Yinchuan's family had troubles,

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
didn't you help him too?

123
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,520
Tongxin,

124
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,280
please help me, will you?

125
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Get up first.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Just say what you need to say.

127
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Don't drag others into this.

128
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,160
You've forgiven me.

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,920
I've recorded everything

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,200
you just said.

131
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,320
If this happens again,

132
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,780
don't blame me for releasing the recording.

133
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,560
I swear there won't be a next time.

134
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm already grateful that you can forgive me.

135
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
As for the rest of you,

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,080
if there's a next time,

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll terminate your contracts immediately.

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Okay, okay.

139
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,760
Xinxin, take care.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,440
You didn't actually sing that new song yourself,

141
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,960
you know what I mean.

142
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
Who are you?

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,280
That guy is dressed like a paparazzi,

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,560
acting all sneaky.

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,159
How can someone stare at one page of newspaper for so long?

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,080
Could it be you?

147
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm MC Gray Wolf.

148
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
Excuse me.

149
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Who is it really?

150
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,240
Who is it?

151
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,360
I'm MC Grey Wolf.

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,080
You're crazy.

153
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
What's going on?

154
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,760
Sorry, sorry.

155
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
I'm MC Grey Wolf.

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,039
I'm MC Grey Wolf.

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,280
Don't move.

158
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,600
I specialize in eating DJ sheep.

159
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,540
You've gained weight.

160
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
You're asking for trouble.

161
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
Come on, let's go.

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Let's go.

163
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,600
Hurry up.

164
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,600
You're late.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
My body clock hasn't adjusted yet.

166
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,520
I'm usually just going to bed at this hour.

167
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
The fact that I'm even here now

168
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,280
is one of the eight wonders of the world, I'm telling you.

169
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,880
From now on, it's 20 yuan fine for every minute late.

170
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,920
You were 15 minutes late this time.

171
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,880
That's 300 yuan.

172
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,920
How much?

173
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,520
How much is it?

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,400
20 yuan per minute?

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,560
Are you robbing me?

176
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,000
My time is very valuable.

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Open the door.

178
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,240
You two sisters

179
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,320
are both no good.

180
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,960
Kid,

181
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,920
don't wear these clothes to work again.

182
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,960
It's cheap.

183
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,080
What's wrong with these clothes?

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,480
So free and relaxing.

185
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,360
Besides, this is a new co-branded release.

186
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,240
You don't know anything but pretend you do.

187
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,800
You scared me to death being all mysterious.

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,240
I thought you were some paparazzi.

189
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,500
With such a sharp nose.

190
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,880
Xinxin, I'd definitely recognize your voice.

191
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,960
It's just that...

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm guessing you must be in some kind of situation.

193
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
That's why you asked me out this way.

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,560
Let me ask you something.

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,960
I just went away for a concert.

196
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,160
How did Jiang Yinchuan come back?

197
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,280
And became your fiancé?

198
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
It's a long story.

199
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,450
But it's not what you think.

200
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,760
I don't really care what happened between you two.

201
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,040
It's just...

202
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,880
He hurt you so badly before.

203
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
Now he's back and I'm worried.

204
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Don't worry.

205
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
I'm not the same Tong Xin as before.

206
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Now, I can play him

207
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
easily.

208
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Are you really that confident?

209
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,560
You don't believe me?

210
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,080
It's not that I don't believe you.

211
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,440
I'm just afraid you'll get hurt again.

212
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,000
How about this? Come back with me

213
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,080
and I'll prove it to you in person.

214
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,220
Your scarf! Don't forget your scarf!

215
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,240
Together! Xin Gravity together!

216
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:25,720
Xinli together! Xinli together!

217
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,800
What's going on?

218
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,960
You came just in time.

219
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,920
It's your turn to perform.

220
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,480
Go help Dr. Jiang out of this situation.

221
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
How long have you two been together?

222
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,400
Xinxin.

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,040
Watch out.

224
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,960
Wow, so sweet.

225
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,760
I didn't expect Dr. Jiang to be such a good boyfriend.

226
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,800
I approve of this marriage.

227
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,040
I suggest you two get married right here.

228
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,970
Dr. Jiang is so gentle with Xinxin.

229
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,400
May I ask you both?

230
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
When did you two start dating?

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,200
Who pursued whom first?

232
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,440
When are you planning to get married?

233
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes, when are you getting married?

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
We're together.

235
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,560
I was the one who pursued her.

236
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,960
Wow, that's so sweet.

237
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,860
I'm also a fan of her music.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,180
After getting to know her better, I realized

239
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,800
that she as a person

240
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
is even more attractive than her songs.

241
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,120
How attractive is she to you?

242
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,650
Give her a kiss for us to see.

243
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:34,560
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

244
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,520
No way! You're really doing it?

245
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,800
Everyone is watching.

246
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,960
Xinxin

247
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Xuanze

248
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,300
Shouran

249
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,770
Leran

250
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:46,880
Shouran

251
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,760
Ziran

252
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:51,720
Kekegehui
