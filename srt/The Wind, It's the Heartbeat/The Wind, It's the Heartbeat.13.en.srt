1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Finally finished.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,160
That's all for this morning's lesson.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,520
Thank you both.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,480
To show my gratitude,

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,600
what would you like for lunch?

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,960
I'll order delivery.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,840
No need.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,400
You mentioned wanting sushi last time,

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,060
so I made it specially for you.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
Wow, it looks delicious!

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
Let me try one.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,840
It tastes amazing.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,280
An'an,

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,340
you could be a Michelin chef someday.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
If you hadn't asked for it,

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,850
I wouldn't have made it.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,560
Jiang Yinchuan,

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,620
you should eat too.

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Try some.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,520
No need.

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,780
I made his portion too.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,400
Thanks,

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm not hungry.

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,140
Eat it or not, I don't care.

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,760
Xinxin, eat up.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,080
You eat too.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Jiang Yinchuan.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,090
I want to apologize to you on behalf of An Ning.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,880
She's actually a very nice person.

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,160
There might be some misunderstanding between you two.

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,960
Don't be angry with her anymore.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
You don't need to apologize for her.

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,640
I don't care what she thinks of me.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,360
You know what.

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,610
This hairstyle of yours is quite cute.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
This is for you.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
I'm sorry everyone

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,280
for keeping you waiting.

39
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,720
Not at all. You're the one we've been waiting for.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,040
It's worth the wait.

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,440
Come Huahua, sit here.

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,100
This seat is reserved for you.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,360
Huahua.

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
Sit here.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,040
Who is this?

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
He's my...

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,760
My name is Lin Bufan.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,730
I'm Mr. Tong's most trusted and reliable driver,

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,900
and his 24-hour personal assistant.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,480
Mr. Tong really cares about his employees.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,120
Now even assistants can join the table for meals.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
Why shouldn't I?

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,640
Mr. Li is joking.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,000
He's not just my assistant,

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,130
but also my brother.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,160
Mr. Tong, it's been a while.

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,540
Let's have a drink.

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
Mr. Tong, you can really hold your liquor.

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,680
Come, let's have a drink.

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
How could you leave me out?

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I'll drink this one first as a toast.

62
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,360
Why is everyone only toasting Hanhan?

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,760
Have you forgotten about me?

64
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,400
You can't play favorites.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,160
I'll take this one.

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,360
Let me.

67
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm her assistant.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll drink for her.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,440
Can you drink alcohol?

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,700
Don't try to act tough.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,920
There's some Wangzai milk.

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
I can drink.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
If you drink too much, who's going to drive me home?

74
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,440
What era do you think this is?

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,360
Playing the knight in shining armor?

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
What's wrong?

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,600
Jealous you didn't get to be

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,240
the hero?

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
Too bad.

80
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,650
You were a step too late.

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,050
You've got quite a mouth on you.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,690
I bet you put on quite an act in front of Xinxin.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
In front of Xinxin,

84
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,850
I don't need to pretend.

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,220
Jiang Yinchuan, I'm warning you.

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
Stop using your injury

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,480
to emotionally blackmail her, understand?

88
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,480
Xinxin,

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,210
you're back so soon.

90
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Everything's been taken care of. How's your hand?

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,440
What did the doctor say?

92
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
Let me see.

93
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,970
It's fine. They've stitched it up.

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
Nothing serious.

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,240
Will it

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
affect your ability to use your hand or perform surgery?

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't worry.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a doctor.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,640
I know my body well.

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,760
That's it. By the way,

101
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,520
um,

102
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,200
how did the endorsement deal go?

103
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,320
What happened with Yiyi in the end?

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
I've reported her to the police.

105
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
She committed intentional assault.

106
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,320
She's completely finished.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,760
An artist with such bad behavior

108
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,800
won't be able to survive in the industry anymore.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
That's good.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,320
I've already followed up with the media, Xinxin.

111
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,280
Don't worry.

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
Xuanze,

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,820
thank you for taking Jiang Yinchuan to the hospital today.

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
No need to thank me.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,760
I only helped because it was your business.

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
If you hadn't arrived in time today,

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,530
I would have been worried sick.

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,760
Xinxin,

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,920
if you have any emergencies in the future, you can come to me directly.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
I'll always be here.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,320
What's wrong?

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,200
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

123
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,760
It's nothing. I'm just a bit thirsty.

124
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,480
I can't open this water. Let me do it.

125
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,500
Careful. Take it slow.

126
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
That's better.

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
What are you doing? Tell me.

128
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,360
It's nothing. Have some more.

129
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,880
I've had enough.

130
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
Are you feeling better now?

131
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,200
Much better.

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Our company's new partner resort

133
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,940
will need your advice and suggestions, senior.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,280
The new resort area should be opening soon, right?

135
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,140
If you need my help with anything,

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,480
just let me know.

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Then I won't hesitate to ask.

138
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,880
Our resort

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,440
is looking for a new brand ambassador.

140
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
What type are you looking for?

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,360
We're planning to find someone.

142
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,760
Why are you still here?

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,720
I still have some things to discuss with Huahua.

144
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,120
You can leave work first.

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Leave work?

146
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm her personal assistant.

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,920
24 hours

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
at her service.

149
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Don't mind his childish temper.

150
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
Always calling me a child.

151
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
Senior, when you have a chance,

152
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,720
I can take you to visit the resort.

153
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,460
Just call me. I'm available anytime.

154
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,020
I'm not available.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,760
What's it to you?

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
I'm her driver.

157
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Her driver.

158
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
Her driver is busy. She can walk.

159
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
It must be midnight by now.

160
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,980
It's late and she has a meeting tomorrow.

161
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,919
Senior, it's almost midnight.

162
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,880
Why don't you go home and rest?

163
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,960
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

164
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
I'll be going now.

165
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Let me walk you out.

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,160
No need, it's fine.

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
I'll walk you out.

168
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,490
You should rest.

169
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,970
No need to see me out.

170
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll walk you

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,320
to the door.

172
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,040
Take care on your way.

173
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,640
Assistant, aren't you leaving?

174
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,600
I need to discuss some family matters with my sister.

175
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
Goodbye, sir.

176
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,120
Be careful

177
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,140
and watch out for traffic.

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,410
Are you close with that guy?

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,080
Calling you by your first name so casually.

180
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,360
It makes me sick.

181
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,560
He's my senior.

182
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,160
Your senior?

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
So what if he's your senior?

184
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,940
You still need to be careful around your senior.

185
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,600
He's serving you food and taking drinks for you.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Who knows what he's really up to.

187
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,620
Shouldn't you be on guard?

188
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
Are you listening to me?

189
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
Kid,

190
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
what are you trying to do?

191
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,960
I told you,

192
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not a kid.

193
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,560
That's it?

194
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,680
What do you mean

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
that's it?

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
If you don't know how,

197
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,400
then learn properly.

198
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
I've reviewed the contract.

199
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,320
Have the legal department double-check it later.

200
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,480
The meeting will proceed as scheduled.

201
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,440
I'll head back this afternoon.

202
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay.

203
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
You're awake.

204
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,180
Now that you're up, hurry and get ready to leave.

205
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,800
So what are we now?

206
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,320
What do you think?

207
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
I think...

208
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,240
Of course we're...

209
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,520
Whatever relationship you say we have, that's what it is.

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,180
Then it's settled.

211
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,520
And also,

212
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
stop calling me kid from now on.

213
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,160
Why is he taking so long in the bathroom?

214
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,460
I hope nothing's happened to him.

215
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,280
Jiang Yinchuan?

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
Jiang Yinchuan!

217
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
Jiang Yinchuan, what are you doing?

218
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
Look at your hands!

219
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,920
How could you be so...

220
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,640
Xinxin.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,560
I was trying to take a shower.

222
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,360
But the buttons got tangled.

223
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,810
And the zipper is stuck.

224
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
You could have asked me for help with this.

225
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
Acting all suspicious.

226
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,800
I thought you were...

227
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,520
No need. Don't help me.

228
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,840
I'll get it undone myself soon.

229
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,600
Your hand is injured.

230
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Let me help you.

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
It seems really stuck.

232
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,560
Hurry up!

233
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm about to burst.

234
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,640
Aren't you in good health?

235
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Why do you spend all day either eating or...

236
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,770
Men and women are built differently. I can't control it.

237
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm dying here.

238
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,170
I can't hold it anymore.

239
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
What are you doing?

240
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,570
Huai Feng

241
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,600
Ziran

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,000
Ziran

243
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,920
Ziran
