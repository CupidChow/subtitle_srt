1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,840
3... Practicing countless times in my heart 2...3

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,120
Practicing countless times in my heart.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
Rehearsing endlessly thousands of times.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
Afraid it's already too late.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,200
I just haven't told you yet, I'm sorry, I love you.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,080
Without you, I cannot breathe.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
I can't bear to see your tears flow for miles.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,200
I just haven't gathered enough courage.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,920
Haven't told you yet, I'm sorry, I love you.

10
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,039
A young girl like you

11
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,920
How embarrassing to go out dressed like this!

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,320
You have no shame, but your father and I still do.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
Xinxin,

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,360
we're only doing this for your own good.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,200
Just listen to your mother.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,720
Come on, change your clothes.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,520
I won't.

18
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,080
I have the freedom to wear what I want.

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,680
Not letting me wear this is restricting my freedom

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,880
and suffocating my soul.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,600
I will not surrender to your tyrannical dictatorship.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,320
What dictatorship?

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,759
I'm asking you to change because these clothes aren't appropriate.

24
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm your mother. Would I ever harm you?

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,280
[Lao Jiang, you're here.]

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
Jiang, you're here.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,680
Uncle Jiang, please help us settle this.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Don't you think my parents are too old-fashioned?

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,840
What's wrong with my clothes?

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,460
[3...2...Look at this kid...2...3]

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
I think

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,140
these clothes are quite cute.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,639
[3...See, you have good taste.2...3]

34
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,039
See? You have good taste.

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,680
Who are you?

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Are you Mr. Jiang's family?

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,000
He's my son, Jiang Yinchuan.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
He goes to Honghai First High School just like you.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,480
So you're my senior at school.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Your son.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,440
Mr. Jiang always says his son is handsome.

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,560
Let me see.

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,880
You mean

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,400
You've liked me

45
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,680
since then?

46
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,079
Then why didn't you tell me?

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,840
Why did you keep avoiding me?

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,580
We come from different worlds after all.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,600
The changes in my family

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,120
constantly reminded me

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,560
whether I should put my feelings aside for now.

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,740
When I was considering

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,880
whether to suppress these feelings,

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,860
my father had already approached me.

55
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,160
It smells so good.

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,820
How did you find this place, Jiang Yinchuan?

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,760
Is it good?

58
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,840
Boss!

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
Don't overcook the squid.

60
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,720
All right!

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Boss,

62
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
two more skewers please.

63
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,170
This grilled cold noodle is so delicious!

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
Good, right?

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,760
Isn't it tasty?

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,640
It's good.

67
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,880
How's Mom doing today?

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
Same as usual.

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,700
I brought some fruit for your mother.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Xiaochuan.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
After work today,

72
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,300
I went to look at some apartments.

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,320
What do you think about finding a place

74
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
near the hospital?

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Staying at Mr. Tong's place

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,130
isn't very convenient in the long run.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
But Mom's treatment costs a lot of money.

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,960
Dad, I'm worried about you.

79
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,890
I can still manage this much money.

80
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,520
They've already helped us so much.

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,440
Shouldn't we be more considerate

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,520
and stop causing them trouble?

83
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:58,080
By the way, I went to pick up Xinxin from school today,

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,810
and I saw you two eating at that street food stall.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Xinxin's parents

86
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,920
don't allow her to eat that kind of food.

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,920
But she seemed to enjoy it.

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,280
I think eating there occasionally

89
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,010
shouldn't be a problem, right?

90
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,480
Once in a while is fine, of course.

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
But

92
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
she can't eat street food her entire life.

93
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,200
And she always enjoys it so much.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,000
Son, I'm sorry that your mom and I

95
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
can't give you a better life.

96
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
I am incapable.

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,880
But I

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,720
know one truth.

99
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,640
If we can't afford nice things,

100
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,840
then we shouldn't look at them too much.

101
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,680
Xiaochuan.

102
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,600
You're my pride and joy.

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,640
I've always thought you were a smart kid.

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
There are many things

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,540
that you understand clearly.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,600
Xinxin

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,440
is also a wonderful child.

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,240
But...

109
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,160
We're simply not from the same world as them.

110
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,360
I believe you understand.

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,040
He told me to face reality.

112
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,960
Later,

113
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Mrs. Fu also talked to me.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,050
She was worried that

115
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,480
if we got together,

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,040
it would create psychological burdens for both of us.

117
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,010
I can't believe my mom approached you.

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,490
How could she interfere with my relationship

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,360
without my consent?

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,280
We can't blame them.

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
What parent doesn't want the best for their child?

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,040
By the way.

123
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
I want to show you something.

124
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
This.

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,770
The birthday gift I owed you back then.

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Why is this bracelet identical

127
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,880
to the one Xuanze gave me?

128
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,920
Although it looks

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
exactly like the one he gave you,

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
it's actually a counterfeit.

131
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,320
But when I bought it,

132
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
I just thought it was beautiful.

133
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,540
I didn't know it was a designer brand.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Until later when I was at the classroom door

135
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,960
and heard what the classmates were saying,

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
I finally realized.

137
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,920
This is a limited edition that's hard to get,

138
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,280
even if we could get one, we couldn't afford it.

139
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
This brand is insanely expensive.

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,840
Xuanze is so good to Tongxin.

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,800
When I first saw it,

142
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
I thought it was perfect for you.

143
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,000
What's their relationship?

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
We can't even be jealous.

145
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,880
There are many counterfeits of this bracelet.

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
He's Xuanze after all,

147
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,320
why would he need to buy a fake?

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,640
Later, I didn't have the courage to give it to you.

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,080
It stayed with me like a warning bell,

150
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
constantly reminding me that like it,

151
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
I wasn't worthy of you.

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,360
Later on the rooftop, I heard

153
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,180
you were going to give up your music dream for me.

154
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,760
That made me even more determined to push you away.

155
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,960
Don't worry, I'm not going to the competition.

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
I didn't do well on the exam anyway,

157
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,200
so I can't go.

158
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,520
Just because of this,

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,159
you're going to give up

160
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,520
the dream you've always pursued?

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,799
It's not about me not trying hard enough now,

162
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,800
the circumstances just don't allow it.

163
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,880
I can't pass the exam,

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
and you're ignoring me.

165
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
Even if it's for a dream,

166
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
it shouldn't be this torturous.

167
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,800
You love music so much,

168
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,210
you love your dream so much.

169
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
How could I let myself

170
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,220
become a stumbling block in your pursuit of your dream?

171
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,300
Then what's going on between you and An Ning?

172
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Guess who I am.

173
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,920
An Ning.

174
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,800
What are you doing?

175
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,480
I like you.

176
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
Can't you tell?

177
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,600
Are you kidding me?

178
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,320
You're Tong Xin's best friend.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,680
So what?

180
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm her good friend,

181
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,250
does that mean I can't like you?

182
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,280
Forget it.

183
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,800
Just know that I can help you.

184
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,540
This is my family's hospital.

185
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
It has the best burn unit in the city.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,360
I can arrange for your mother to be admitted

187
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,960
and receive the best treatment.

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,640
And don't worry about the medical expenses.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,260
Why are you helping me?

190
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Of course there are conditions.

191
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,560
What conditions?

192
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
I want Tong Xin

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,040
to completely give up on you.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Even if I'm not with Tong Xin,

195
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,840
I will never like you.

196
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,700
It doesn't matter.

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Just fulfill your part of the deal.

198
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,340
Think about it carefully.

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,290
I'll be waiting for your good news.

200
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,040
Hey, Dad.

201
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,880
Xiaochuan, the doctor says your mom's condition isn't good.

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
They suggest transferring her to another hospital.

203
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,480
Help me find a better hospital.

204
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
I'll borrow some money from my friends.

205
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
A good hospital won't be cheap.

206
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,880
About Mom's hospital transfer,

207
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
don't worry.

208
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll take care of it.

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,800
Jiang Yinchuan

210
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
Have you figured out how to reject Tongxin?

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Tongxin is very stubborn.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Once she decides to do something,

213
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,800
she won't turn back even if she hits a brick wall.

214
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,760
But,

215
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,080
she has one fatal weakness.

216
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,160
Her pride is too strong.

217
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,840
If you can reject her to her face

218
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,920
and hurt her pride,

219
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,560
she will give up on you.

220
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
If Tongxin confesses to you,

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
I want you to reject her harshly.

222
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,980
I've found the best doctors for your mother.

223
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,920
She'll be fine soon.

224
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Thank you.

225
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
Tongxin...

226
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,450
Look at your condition,

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,940
and you're still worried about Tongxin?

228
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Don't worry.

229
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Tongxin is upset about her breakup,

230
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,960
so her mother, to comfort her,

231
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,160
agreed to join the competition with me.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,840
We'll pursue our dreams together

233
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,240
and have a bright future.

234
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
If you really care about her,

235
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,050
don't show up in front of her again.

236
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
Understand?

237
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,720
I understand.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
I understand.

239
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,200
Xiaochuan, your aunt called.

240
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,060
She wants to take your mother abroad for treatment.

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Aunt?

242
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Don't worry about your mother's illness.

243
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Just come to my place with your father.

244
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,240
The medical facilities here are definitely better than back home.

245
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
I'll find out which doctor is the best

246
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,280
and send your mother there.

247
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
She'll definitely be cured.

248
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
Your father, that man,

249
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,170
didn't even tell me about something this important.

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,920
I only found out after I went abroad

252
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
that you had a car accident.

253
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,200
The accident had nothing to do with you.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
You don't need to apologize.

255
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,880
Actually,

256
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,120
living in a foreign country

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,840
is much harder than I imagined.

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,840
Didn't you encourage me before

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,120
to study medicine?

260
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,960
That's when I started thinking about becoming a doctor.

261
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,600
During the toughest times,

262
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,160
it was your singing

263
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,730
that kept me company through countless days and nights.

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,960
So how did you

265
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,320
meet An Ning abroad?

266
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,080
Later,

267
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I followed my mentor to do an internship at a hospital.

268
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,530
That's where I ran into An Ning.

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,800
She kept pursuing me,

270
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
insisting that I become her attending physician.

271
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,560
Her throat had actually healed long ago.

272
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,290
Last time on Changfeng Island,

273
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,040
she deliberately created those misunderstandings too.

274
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,680
I've always known

275
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,540
she never really had feelings for me.

276
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,560
Everything she did,

277
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,940
from beginning to end,

278
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,880
was just to make me leave you.

279
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,840
What about you?

280
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,520
Weren't you doing well abroad?

281
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,330
Why did you suddenly come back?

282
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,280
Because of you.

283
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,600
In the past, because of my cowardice,

284
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I made decisions I regretted.

285
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
All these years,

286
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,040
I've been living with regret.

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,240
This time,

288
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,200
I want to be brave.

289
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,040
It's my turn to come to you.

290
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,320
Tongxin,

291
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,040
are you willing?

292
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I am.

293
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,200
Ziran

294
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,010
Ziran

295
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:47,840
[Unintelligible text]
