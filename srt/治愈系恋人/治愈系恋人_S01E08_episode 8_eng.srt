♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,980

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Has Su Wei'an... had any illness before?

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
No.

18
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,340
How about her family?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,600
Is there any genetic disease in her family?

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,400
No.

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,640
Wei'an had a physical exam with me before going to college, and she was in very good health.

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,960
Her father died in a car accident,

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,780
but before that, he ran marathons every year and was very fit.

24
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,900
Her mother does square dancing every day and is also very healthy.

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,240
Why did you ask?

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,220
Nothing.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,900
- Dr. Xu. How is she? 
 - How is she?

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,420
Don't worry. No organs are injured.

29
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,660
However, the wound is quite deep, and she has lost a lot of blood.

30
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,100
We've transfused 800cc so far, and she is still unconscious.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,780
Let's transfer her to the ward for observation first.

32
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,480
Can we go see her now?

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,240
It's so late already. Let her have a good rest.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,980
There are nurses on duty in the ward. They will take good care of her.

35
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,240
By the way, Dr. Xu, I need to trouble you to have her get

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,800
a full body CT scan or MRI, echocardiogram, complete blood count,

37
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,540
tumor markers, and all other necessary tests. Please do a thorough physical examination.

38
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,260
Anything wrong?

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
Do you not trust my medical skills?

40
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
I don't mean that.

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,500
It's about something else that I need to confirm.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,180
Okay. I'll get the physical examination form ready.

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Dr. Gu, why do you want to check Wei'an's health?

44
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
You've been with her all the time. Has she shown any unusual behavior lately?

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,340
No.

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,980
Dr. Gu, you're scaring me. What’s wrong with Wei'an?

47
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,900
Is she sick?

48
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,120
Let's hope not.

49
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,540
 I'm still alive.

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,050
 Got saved again.

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,680
 I have to live a good life.

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,780
Xiao Su, you are awake. How do you feel?

53
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,920
Much better.

54
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,760
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,160
Your outstanding medical skills saved my life again.

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Don't thank me. You should thank Dr. Gu.

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,720
He was so worried about you after the incident.

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,460
As a neurosurgeon, he has seen his fair share of blood and gore.

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,000
Why did he panic at the sight of just a little blood?

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,820
Well, he's not here to check on me.

61
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,740
Last night, he waited until your surgery was done and made sure you were okay before he went back to sleep.

62
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,120
Where's my purse?

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,420
- Have you seen it? 
 - What purse?

64
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,560
The one I carry around every day. All of my stuff...

65
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,080
Don't move! You just got stitched up.

66
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,180
I'm telling you, the wound will open easily when you move like that.

67
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,260
The purse... I remember Interpreter Jiang had it yesterday.

68
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,560
You won't lose it. Don't worry. Have a good rest.

69
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,740
Thank you.

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,680
 All the results are normal with Su Wei'an's health check. I will send you the paper report in the afternoon.

71
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,740
 What on Earth is she doing then?

72
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,880
Boss!

73
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,660
Boss!

74
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,480
Interpreter Su woke up.

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,140
Okay.

76
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,940
Boss, did you hear me?

77
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,980
Interpreter Su woke up.

78
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
Are you not going to check on her?

79
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,680
The brain tumor patient admitted yesterday is scheduled for surgery tonight.

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,160
Have the pre-operative preparations been completed?

81
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
But, Boss, Interpreter Su suffered such a serious injury and bled so much.

82
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,800
You were so frantic last night, like you lost your soul. Why are you acting like nothing happened?

83
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,060
I have made up my mind. It severs her right for seeking death.

84
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,340
I don't want to see her now.

85
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,020
 Wei'an, have you thought about how I should live without you?

86
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,960
Jiang Jiang, I have good news! Interpreter Su woke up!

87
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,420
Not my business.

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,160
I thought you were good friends!

89
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,460
Are you not going to show some concern for her?

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,280
Nope. She doesn't need others to care about her.

91
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,020
I have work to do. Out of my way.

92
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,300
What's going on?

93
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,080

94
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,900
This medicine... Take this medicine twice a day.

95
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,410
Okay.

96
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,720
Give this to Wei'an for me.

97
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Don't look. It's Wei'an's underwear inside.

98
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,840
Why would you give it to me? It's inappropriate for me to give it to her.

99
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,980
Just give it to her.

100
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,620
Boss,

101
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,220
you speak contrary to your thoughts.

102
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,620
You said you don't care about Interpreter Su, but what are you doing here?

103
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,180
Her lips are a little dry. Go grab a box of Q-tips.

104
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,900
There are Q-tips in the room.

105
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,080
You're awake.

106
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,560
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,360
Someone said your lips were dry and asked me to apply some moisturizer for you.

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,340
Someone? Who?

109
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,320
I can't tell you.

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,280
Gu Yunzheng?

111
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,180
That's what you said, not me.

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,340
This

113
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,380
is your underwear.

114
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Don't misunderstand. Someone else asked me to give it to you.

115
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,500
Someone else?

116
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,380
Jiang Jiang?

117
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,520
I didn't say anything.

118
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,620
These people who assigned you these jobs, why don't they just come and see me?

119
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,420
Are they too busy with work?

120
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,460
Or do they not want to see me at all?

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,040
I have no idea.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,920
Get well soon! When you recover completely, go ask them yourself.

123
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,840
In that case, help me do something for the "someone" you said.

124
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,620
- Anyone? Help me! 
 - Jiang Jiang, it's me!

125
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,600
It's me!

126
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,740
Fang Mingfan! Are you out of your mind?

127
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,420
Breaking into the girls' dorm in the middle of the night, are you trying to scare me to death?

128
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,360
Someone is worried that you will forget to turn off the fan,

129
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,260
so she had me check on you in case you catch a cold.

130
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,620
Someone? Who is the "someone"?

131
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,480
Just someone.

132
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,100

133
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,180
Fang Mingfan,

134
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,860
what is this you gave me?

135
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,520
I mean this black, mud-like stuff. What is it?

136
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,680
I know this is someone's stash of rare coffee beans,

137
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,140
but I don't know how to grind or brew them. Feels like I've ruined them.

138
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,100
You guys are so annoying. So hard to please, all of you.

139
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,690
Asking me, a surgeon, to work as a servant and keep secrets for you,

140
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,740
it's too much for me.

141
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,140
She probably had her stitches out by now.

142
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,220
Congrats, your servant career should be over now.

143
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,960
Wei'an's report is out so fast.

144
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,540
All these indicators are pretty normal.

145
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,060
They are not just normal. She's even healthier than me.

146
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,980
Dr. Gu.

147
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,420
Take your medicine.

148
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,160
Who gives medicine like that?

149
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,400
This is your health check report. Take a look at it.

150
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,560
When did I do a health check?

151
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,600
Su Wei'an,

152
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,460
I thought you had a terminal illness, which is why you were recklessly living life on the edge.

153
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,040
Looks like I was wrong. You seem perfectly healthy.

154
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,660
I saw your insurance policy.

155
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,540
All humans are destined to die. You may get 100 grand or one million in payout.

156
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,340
I want to see how much I can get.

157
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,440
You won't get a single cent in compensation.

158
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Who said that?

159
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,960
Su Wei'an,

160
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,340
if you continue to be so focused on dying, I will definitely report you to the insurance company for insurance fraud.

161
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,860
- I mean what I say. 
 - What are you talking about?

162
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,980
Also, I was not seeking death.

163
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,560
Well, what you did was not for the right cause. You did it to kill yourself.

164
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,940
From you dropping out of school to coming to Lakaya

165
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,040
and to everything that happened when I met you,

166
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,580
I've figured out what you're really after.

167
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,320
Rather than watch you try new ways to kill yourself every day, let me use my professional expertise

168
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,480
to help you.

169
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,460
What do you want?

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,270
You want euthanasia, don't you?

171
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,740
You don't need to plan to go to Switzerland anymore.

172
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,980
The medicine I gave you can help you fulfill your wish.

173
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,900
What's the matter with you?

174
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,900
That's useless. This medicine will dissolve quickly after being taken.

175
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,710
What did I do to offend you?

176
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,200
This medicine uses Dracaena draco tree resin,

177
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,020
cactus juice, rafflesia petals, stems of water lilies, and rooster's blood.

178
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,820
It was used by witch doctors in the past to help terminally ill patients escape the agony of their sickness.

179
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,060
As long as you take it, you will die peacefully in your sleep, free from pain and suffering.

180
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,400
So mystical that it sounds like witchcraft, not any real poison at all.

181
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:04,040
It's not poison, indeed. It can help people who want euthanasia find peace.

182
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,460
Are you feeling a heat sensation throughout your body now?

183
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,380
And your mouth is a little dry, wanting to drink water?

184
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,980
It's working.

185
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,100
You are taking my life.

186
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,160
To a healthy person, drugging her is taking her life,

187
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,880
but to you, I am only helping you as you wish.

188
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,260
You must be messing with me.

189
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not.

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,160
Su Wei'an, before I thought, you were throwing yourself out to save me.

191
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:55,600
But now I understand you'd sacrifice yourself for anything at any time, no matter if it were a random baby or something else.

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,660
Most importantly, you are not doing this for any purpose but solely trying to kill yourself.

193
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:08,760
Don't worry. After you die, I will dissect you

194
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,680
and sell your organs, like heart and liver, etc., on the black markets.

195
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,580
As we are close friends, I will give all the money to your mom.

196
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,580
Okay.

197
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,900
Anyway, if I die, you won't escape the law.

198
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,400
Then I shall accompany you on this journey, fulfilling your wish.

199
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,020
What are you doing, Su Wei'an? Don't be reckless. Lie back down!

200
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,020
Lie back down! You have six more hours to go.

201
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,180
Listen to me,

202
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,380
the best part about this medicine is that after you take it, it will shut down your organs very quickly,

203
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,580
unless you drink a lot of water now to dilute the toxins in your body.

204
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,280
You don't want to die now?

205
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,320
Say it out loud. Say that you don't want to die anymore.

206
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,060
Say it!

207
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
Say it!

208
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,700
I don't want to die anymore! I want to live, okay?

209
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,740
Why do you want to live now?

210
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:54,320
Tell me the reason. If you give me the reason, I will give you the water and the antidote.

211
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,360
I want to live as much as I can. Wouldn't it be a waste to die so young?

212
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,080
My mom is still waiting for me at home.

213
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,880
Fine,

214
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,160
I admit that I'm a coward, scared of death. Is that okay?

215
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,540
The antidote.

216
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,900

217
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,480
Ferrous tablets. Gu Yunzheng, is it fun to mess with me?

218
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,900
Su Wei'an, you've been thinking about what happens after death all this time, haven't you?

219
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,360
The will, bank cards, insurance policies,

220
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,580
everything was clearly arranged.

221
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,780
But if these really were the last six hours of your life,

222
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
what would you do?

223
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,360
But they're not.

224
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,920
Whether they are or not, I want you to remember what you said today:

225
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,540
You don't want to die. You want to live.

226
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,720
I saved your life, and I want you

227
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,340
to take good care of yourself starting from today.

228
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,880
Stop trashing your life like this.

229
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,580
Remember to use an umbrella when it's raining.

230
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,560
Remember to wear more clothes when it's cold.

231
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,680
If you ever feel sick, I'll hold you responsible.

232
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Rest well.

233
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,460
Remember to take the ferrous tablets.

234
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,560
You're a little anemic.

235
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,280
Dr. Gu, how is Wei'an now?

236
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,440
She looks fine to me. I hope she'll really listen to me.

237
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,920
Jiang Jiang, you're finally here to see me!

238
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,220
I missed you so much!

239
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,020
Does anywhere hurt now?

240
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,900
I have a big hole in my belly,

241
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,780
and I will only get better after a pretty lady hugs me.

242
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,020
Do you know what you told me that night?

243
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,260
Did...

244
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,540
Did I tell you the password of my bank account?

245
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,340
Can you erase that from your mind?

246
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,340
Wei'an,

247
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,260
when we were in school, you told me

248
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,160
that in the future, we'd go see the Northern Lights in Iceland together,

249
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,120
go to all the milk tea shops in Jinhai,

250
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,680
be each other's bridesmaid no matter who gets married first,

251
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,270
and be godmothers to each other's kids.

252
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,700
You told me that when we got old,

253
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,400
we'd retire together and live somewhere with warm weather and blooming flowers by the sea.

254
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,740
I took every word you said very seriously.

255
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,820
But you,

256
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,500
you came to Lakaya without a word,

257
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,460
got into trouble and hurt, and even wanted to elope with Eliot!

258
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,700
- Jiang Jiang. 
 - Don't interrupt. Listen to me first.

259
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,000
I just want to ask you. Before you make a decision, have you ever thought about my feelings?

260
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,320
Do you truly consider me as a friend?

261
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:04,600
Have you ever thought about what I would do if you died?

262
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,900
How should I explain it to your mom?

263
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,720
Jiang Jiang.

264
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,440
I'm sorry.

265
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,180
I know I'm stupid, useless,

266
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,240
and always following you around without being of any help.

267
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm a burden to you.

268
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,040
Jiang Jiang. It's not like that.

269
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,540
- Listen to me. 
 - Don't say anything, Wei'an.

270
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,940
I've made up my mind.

271
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,120
I'll buy a ticket back home in a few days.

272
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,440
We've both grown up.

273
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,100
I won't cling to you anymore.

274
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,480
Jiang Jiang.

275
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,860

276
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,985
Knowing you've taken the poison, so you're in fear that you won't wake up if you fall asleep?

277
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,460
I've been lying down for too long. I want to go out and get some fresh air.

278
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Let's go. I'll go with you.

279
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,820
No need.

280
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,680
It's not that serious. I'm not handicapped or bedridden.

281
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,780
What are you doing?

282
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,820
Taking you on your way.

283
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,160
Where are we going?

284
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,360
You'll find out later.

285
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,580
Su Wei'an.

286
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,140
Do you know what a glioma specialist means to me?

287
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,000
So you pushed me here in the middle of the night just to have me listen

288
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,940
to your brilliant resume as the youngest associate professor of neurosurgery in China?

289
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,620
Every year, among the glioma patients I treat,

290
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,620
most of them are stage III and stage IV malignant tumor patients.

291
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,420
Their median survival is 15 to 17 months.

292
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,440
I've seen kids who just started school,

293
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,220
students about to graduate from college, talented painters,

294
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:37,860
and retirees ready to travel the world with their partners.

295
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,960
Many of them are really interesting.

296
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,700
I really want to be friends with them.

297
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,320
But I dare not.

298
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:55,205
Because there's always a voice in my heart reminding me that they will leave this world soon.

299
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:12,780
I remember a couple. The husband had a glioblastoma.

300
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,180
The cost of electric field therapy for a year is nearly one million yuan.

301
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,020
His wife sold their house.

302
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,260
She took care of her sick husband and their child, who was preparing for college by herself.

303
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,860
She was very strong and optimistic.

304
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:36,660
And there was a mother whose MRI showed a very poor prognosis.

305
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,960
She cried in the consulting room

306
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,120
and begged me to let her live a few more years.

307
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,780
She wanted to teach

308
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,480
her child who had just started kindergarten, to dress and feed themselves.

309
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:04,920
Actually, there are many examples of people who refuse to compromise with death.

310
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,920
Even in the most desperate situations, some people never give up.

311
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,840
Su Wei'an.

312
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,820
I don't know why you don't value your life.

313
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,780
I just want to tell you

314
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,080
that the people around you care about you a lot.

315
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,880
Jiang Muying, your mom, and me.

316
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,720
Your life is really important to the people who love you.

317
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,860
We don't know what will happen tomorrow.

318
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,260
But moments like this,

319
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,020
where we can enjoy the moonlight and smell the flowers,

320
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,320
are really precious.

321
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,980
I want to live, too.

322
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,430
Su. Someone is looking for you.

323
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,240
How do you do?

324
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,933
Thank you for saving my child.

325
00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:43,076
You're a lucky star.

326
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:46,096
Driving away my bad luck.

327
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,720
She said I'm a lucky star.

328
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:54,311
It's the first time someone said that to me.

329
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,695
It's something we should do. No need to thank us.

330
00:30:02,695 --> 00:30:07,680
Next time, during the full moon, I'll take him to the Dark Rainbow to pray.

331
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,920
Dark Rainbow?

332
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,760
Tell me about it!

333
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,460
Be careful.

334
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,540
Just now, Isa told me that the locals have a custom.

335
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,240
Mothers will take their children

336
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,120
to the Dark Rainbow to pray, hoping to bring good luck to the children.

337
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,240
The place where we can see the dark rainbow recently is in Labe Village.

338
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,080
Why are you looking at me like that? Is there money on my face?

339
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,320
Labe Village is far away. I'll give you a 20% discount on my vehicle.

340
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,400
You're still thinking about doing business? It seems that you can live well now.

341
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,060
Are you willing to accompany me to see the dark rainbow?

342
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,140
Sure.

343
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,500
Deal.

344
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,100
Jiang Jiang.

345
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,520
Don't go.

346
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,060
- Don't leave, please. 
 - Sit down and eat. I'm starving. Come.

347
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,660
- Sit down quickly. 
 - Sit.

348
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,420
Jiang Jiang, look. This is your favorite hotpot. Supplies in Lakaya are limited.

349
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,400
I bought everything I could. You have to try it.

350
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,300
Have some beef tripes first. We used to order beef tripes when we had a spicy hot pot.

351
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,240
It's your favorite.

352
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,660
You can't cook the tripe for too long. Otherwise,

353
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,720
it'll become unpalatable and hard to chew. You might as well throw it away.

354
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll eat it myself.

355
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,160
Let's cook some fatty beef. Fatty beef doesn't get tough. Here.

356
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,320
Sauce.

357
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,760
This is a special sauce I made for you. Nobody else has it, only you.

358
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,200
Try it, it's delicious.

359
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,480
The spicy broth's flavor is already complex enough.

360
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,800
It's okay to use simple sesame oil and garlic for the sauce.

361
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,900
Isn't simple better?

362
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I'll eat.

363
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,100
I love eating spicy broth with sesame sauce.

364
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,920
Brown sugar rice cake, try it.

365
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,160
The rice cake can be found everywhere in Lakaya, but the brown sugar is not easy to find.

366
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Eat it while it's hot.

367
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,240
Brown sugar rice cake is too sweet and sticky.

368
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,440
It sticks to your teeth and doesn't digest well. I can't shake it off.

369
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,720
How about drinking cola? Give me the cola.

370
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,520
Cola goes well with hot pot. It's a perfect match just like us.

371
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,900
The carbonation of cola enhances the spiciness. It's not a good match.

372
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,820
Jiang Muying. Are you going too far?

373
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,260
Su Wei'an is injured, but she still prepared such a feast for you.

374
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,540
And they're all your favorite dishes. How could you suddenly change like this?

375
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,700
People always change,

376
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,280
don't they?

377
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,860
Jiang Jiang, don't say that.

378
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm sorry, I know.

379
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,700
I know I made you angry.

380
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,780
Jiang Jiang. You came to Lakaya to have a happy vacation.

381
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,160
Don't let me ruin your mood.

382
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,940
I know I'm impulsive and reckless and always overlook your feelings.

383
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,740
If we have to say who is a burden, it's definitely me. How could it be you?

384
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,180
If you really want to leave,

385
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,340
I won't dare to keep you.

386
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,120
But I just want to tell you, you're my best friend.

387
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,400
In the past, now, and in the future. It will never change.

388
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,920
Please don't be mad, okay?

389
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,900
Your wound hasn't healed yet. You can't eat spicy food.

390
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,340
Okay. I won't eat. I'll eat plain broth.

391
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,760
As long as you're not mad.

392
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,460
Boss. While we're talking, you finished all the good food.

393
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
There's nothing that can't be solved with a hot pot.

394
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,520
If there is, then we'll have two meals.

395
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,420
Right. Eat more, come.

396
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,900
Come, eat more.

397
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,840
You guys are amazing.

398
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,040
You managed to get tripe and duck intestines in Lakaya!

399
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,500
We have to thank the cafeteria auntie. She even got us the double-flavor hot pot.

400
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,720
Come on, eat this.

401
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,380
It's for you.

402
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,120

403
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,360
Master of moral and skill. Able to revive the dead

404
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,420
So, have you been revived? 
  (T/N: can also mean in love)

405
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,060
I'm thanking you from the bottom of my heart. Why are you sarcastic and mocking?

406
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,840
Is this banner only for me?

407
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,000
What else?

408
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,470
Dr. Xu performed the surgery for you. How will you show gratitude to him?

409
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:03,070
I promised to translate two papers for him. What's wrong?

410
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,620
So, this banner is only for me, right?

411
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,330
Since you've accepted it. Shouldn't you do something for me then?

412
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:25,300
Su Wei'an. This nature of being a penny-pincher is really coded in your DNA.

413
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,860
Today, I'd have to trouble Dr. Gu in having you accompany me outside.

414
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,440
No trouble at all.

415
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,860
Because I'm not going. I have a surgery later.

416
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,160
But I've checked the schedule already.

417
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,800
From now on, you don't have any consultations or surgeries scheduled for today.

418
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,140
Dr. Gu. It can only be you.

419
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,660
Why only me? Why not someone else?

420
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,080
Because you are not someone else.

421
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,840
Well, let me think about it.

422
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,780
"A teacher for a day is a father for a lifetime." You can be considered half a father. 
  (T/N: famous saying)

423
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,680
Father?

424
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,540
I won't go.

425
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,900
Then, I will let everyone in the hospital know that the Chinese doctor disregards human lives,

426
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,760
ignores patients' needs, and has no compassion for his compatriots.

427
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,900
Save it. Whatever. Anyway, I won't fall for your tricks.

428
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,280
- Let's stop here. 
 - Be careful.

429
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,780
Okay, let's buy a cellphone here.

430
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,100
Su Wei'an, it looks like I owe you from my past life.

431
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,720
Not the past life. The last time.

432
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
Last time,

433
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,240
when you threw my phone to the trafficker, it was quite skillful.

434
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,560
That was an act of desperation.

435
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,680
If you were so desperate, why didn't you throw your own phone?

436
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,020
Throw mine? Would the General's men be able to find us?

437
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,840
Did you get the General's men?

438
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,280
What else? Did they come out of thin air?

439
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,280
You went to ride a motorcycle, and I messaged Jiang Muying, sharing the phone's location.

440
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,420

441
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,420

442
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,500

443
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,660
Cunning guy.

444
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,080
I should take a good look at the cellphone business in Lakaya.

445
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,440
Maybe I'll discover a new business opportunity.

446
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,560
Take your pick. I'll pay for whatever you like.

447
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,340
Not bad, you're aware.

448
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,960
Sir. Please show me the most expensive and latest model phone.

449
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,060
Okay. Here is the newest model. Take a look and see how you like it.

450
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,620
Take a look.

451
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,000
- Is this the latest model? 
 - Yes, it is.

452
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,780
I haven't heard of this brand before.

453
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,760
I want the most expensive one.

454
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,400
Okay.

455
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,240
Another one.

456
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,120

457
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,680
This one is more expensive.

458
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,900
This one is okay. How much is it?

459
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,340
It's 280 US dollars.

460
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,120
So cheap.

461
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,700
It's just over 1,000 yuan in RMB.

462
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,180
Is there anything more expensive?

463
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,740
No rush. Take your time. Pick one you like.

464
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,860
I'll pay for it anyway. Don't worry.

465
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,440
Did you already know there are no expensive mobile phones in this shop?

466
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,980
How could I know? You chose this shop.

467
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,760
Nothing caught your eye? This one seems good.

468
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,420
Can I take a look at this one? Thank you.

469
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,960
This model is quad SIM and quad standby.

470
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,700
It's got a tanning function and a very loud ringtone.

471
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,280
I've seen patients use it.

472
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,060
If it works so well, keep it for yourself. Give me back my original phone.

473
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,900
All right. You don't like it? If you don't like it, we don't need it.

474
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,860
Anyway, nobody is looking for you.

475
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,060
Forget it. If it's free, why not take it?

476
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,480
I want this one. He pays.

477
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,680
Okay.

478
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,520
- How much is it? 
 - It's 280 US dollars.

479
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,680
Your boyfriend is really nice.

480
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,160
No, we're not like that.

481
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:10,990

482
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,000
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

483
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,200
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

484
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,780
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

485
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:28,100
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

486
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,960
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

487
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,620
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

488
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,700
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

489
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:49,980
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

490
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,120
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing star  ♫

491
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,200
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

492
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,300
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

493
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,340
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

494
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:16,120
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

495
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,720
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

496
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,300
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

497

♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫
