 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,060
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,540
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:49,230
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,160
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,220
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,280
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,480
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,920
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,780

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,680

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,820
 On my 478th day of providing medical aid in Langkaya, I flew to a neighboring city

17
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,420
 to direct a resection surgery on a large meningioma tumor for a patient with heart failure.

18
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,300
 I then rushed back to Langkaya, where another major operation was waiting for me.

19
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,820
 Our mission here has two goals.

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,820
  First, to save more lives under the harsh local medical conditions,

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,880
 and second, to teach the skills necessary so that when we leave this area,

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,100
 the local doctors can continue to provide the best treatment for patients.

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,540

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,820

25
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,140
Has the transferred patient arrived yet?

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,860
Yes. The patient sustained injuries from a falling object and has skull fractures and enophthalmos.

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,140
There's significant nasal discharge now.

28
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,980
Due to limited local hospital resources, we could only apply basic dressings to the open wounds.

29
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,180
 The patient is currently in a mild coma.

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,260
What's the GCS score? 
  (T/N: Glasgow Coma Scale, scores below 8, patient is in a coma.)

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,920
 Six.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,500
I think it's a comminuted skull base fracture with cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,940
Send me the CT scans right away and get ready to do surgery within an hour.

34
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,860
I upgraded my seat to first class so I can come out earlier and save time.

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,800
Tell the driver to meet me...

36
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,780
at Gate No. 3 in five minutes.

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,300

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,620
Here is the breakdown of the shipping costs. You can pick up the goods now.

39
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,004
Thanks.

40
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,480
Hi.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,260
Take these two boxes to my car.

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,600
One dollar per box.

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,340
One dollar per box.

44
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,360
Fine.

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,960

46
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,580
Here comes the fun.

47
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,240
 Boss, the car got stuck in traffic on the way to the airport.

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,820
 The traffic situation in Lakaya is very bad.

49
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,060
 The time saved from the seat upgrade might be wasted.

50
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
 Why don't you wait a bit longer?

51
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,520
No, I'll figure something out on my own.

52
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,100
Hello.

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,901
Follow me, everyone.

54
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,150
What special local products does Lakaya have?

55
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,660
Here, we can see...

56
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,680
 Does he really need to use a cart in such a tiny airport?

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,301
Welcome to Langkaya!

58
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,080
What's this?

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,400
Here. Do you guys need Moutai?

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,020
It's guaranteed to be authentic.

61
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,460
Here, split these.

62
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,920
Buying Moutai in Lakaya to bring back, is this a joke?

63
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,400
- That's right. 
 - Sir, you don't understand.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
You'd be missing out if you didn't buy a bottle of Moutai in Lakaya to take back with you.

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,760
The price here is 100 USD per bottle.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,680
How's that?

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,460
In China, you can't even buy half a bottle for that price.

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,580
It's so cheap. Is it fake?

69
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,520
Right. How can this...

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Exporting Moutai to Lakaya is subject to taxes. It only costs 400 to 500 RMB  (~$54 -$68)  per bottle.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,920
Young lady, aren't you making too much profit?

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,680
Come on, this is just a small business.

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,420
I had to pay for customs, space, rent, labor, and things like that.

74
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,700
After all that, I'm really not making that much.

75
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,880
This still isn't reliable. What if they're fake?

76
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
- If we drink fake alcohol... 
 - It's really too cheap.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,600
Your body won't be able to handle it.

78
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,180
That's fine. You're here as tourists, so I won't force you to buy anything.

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,540
General Kouyate has already ordered my alcohol.

80
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,600
- He'll serve it at his family banquet tomorrow. 
 - Wait!

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,880
Moutai in Lakaya is really much cheaper than in China.

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,260
At this price, you can even afford to drink it yourself.

83
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,440
- I'll buy one. 
 - Okay!

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,600
Really?

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
Yes!

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,680
- Here! 
 - Thank you!

87
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,920
There's enough for everyone. No need to rush!

88
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,740
For an anterior cranial fossa comminuted fracture,

89
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,460
we must immediately remove the bone fragments that are embedded in the brain and compressing the optic nerve.

90
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,940
How's the patient now?

91
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,240
The patient just had an epileptic seizure that lasted over five minutes.

92
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,700
For now, we administered barbital for the symptoms.

93
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,320
 The GCS dropped to five.

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,360
 He's in a moderate coma, and his left pupil is dilated.

95
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
Monitor the patient's vital signs continuously.

96
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,960
If the GCS drops by one more point, operate immediately without reporting to me.

97
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,980
 Boss, but I...

98
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
No "buts."

99
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,720
Fang Mingfan, a brain herniation won't wait for you to prepare yourself.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,320
 Isn't this the rich guy who was riding the cart just now?

101
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,700
I need to hang up now.

102
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,060
My compatriot, where are you headed? I'll give you a ride.

103
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,380
There's no need. I'll take a taxi.

104
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,980
A taxi?

105
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,240
You need to prepare yourself then.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,100
The traffic on the main road from the airport to downtown will frustrate you to death.

107
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,940
Ride with me. I guarantee that I can get you anywhere in the downtown area within 50 minutes.

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,720
50 minutes?

109
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Are you sure?

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,160
Are you in a rush?

111
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,600
How about this? Since we're both Chinese, I'll charge you $100, no more, no less.

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,380
100 dollars?

113
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,700
Time is gold.

114
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,480
I'll pay you 100 dollars if I take longer than promised.

115
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,340
Where's your car?

116
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,080
Pay a deposit first.

117
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,140
Here's the full amount. Lead the way.

118
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,900
You're quite generous! Follow me.

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,780
We've been walking for eight minutes.

120
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,320
Where on earth is your car? I'm really in a rush.

121
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,120
We're almost there.

122
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,960
It's a convertible vehicle with leather seats, and the boss will personally drive you.

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,060
This is it?

124
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,300
- Where do I sit? 
 - Right here.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,980
What about my luggage?

126
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,720
That's easy. Right here.

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,960
I drive very well. There'll be no problems.

128
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,680
Don't worry.

129
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,400
Are you being serious?

130
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,060
 As a doctor, being helpless in the face of illness is actually the greatest pain.

131
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,080
Well... If you think my bike is crappy, you can just take a taxi. I'll refund you the money.

132
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,260
Hurry and get going.

133
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,920
10 minutes have already passed.

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
You have 40 minutes left.

135
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Hurry up.

136
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,460
Then... where to?

137
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,360
Friendship Hospital.

138
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,020
Why are you looking at me? Watch the road!

139
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,240
Can you go faster?

140
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,020
Hold on tight.

141
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,860
- What are you doing? 
 - Are you blind?

142
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,060
Come on, a traffic jam?

143
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,644
It looks like a car accident.

144
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,684
Is there an alternate route?

145
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,240
Sit tight.

146
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,639
I'm speeding, so you have to pay extra.

147
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,680
I asked you to drive faster, not fly!

148
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,080
Unlike you, I still want to live.

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,420

150
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
Slow down.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,800
If the General's alcohol spills, we both...

152
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,340
Hey...

153
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,380
What now?

154
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,700
We got here 10 minutes early. You charge extra for speeding, right?

155
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,780
It's not that.

156
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,900
50 dollars is already double the price.

157
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,700
I should give you 50 dollars back.

158
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,180
There's no need.

159
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,420

160
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,200
Boss, I think you should do it.

161
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Vitals?

162
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,340
Vitals.

163
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:00,260
Heart rate is 65 and high pressure is 120mmHg.

164
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,620
Oxygen saturation is 92%. Vital signs are stable.

165
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,420
Dr. Fang, the surgery was done very timely.

166
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
Hello? Jiang Jiang.

167
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,400
It's next month. I'll be back next month.

168
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
You think I believe you?

169
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,420
Su Wei'an, you say the same thing every time.

170
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,440
What excuse will you give me next month?

171
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,300
Traffic jam? Stomachache?

172
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,680
 Overslept?

173
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,740
 According to you, the airline has already gone on strike twice.

174
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,611
I promise I'll be back next month, okay?

175
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:53,700
 Whatever!

176
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,360
Hurry and pick me up at the airport.

177
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,000
The airport?

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,840
What airport?

179
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,080
The airport in Lakaya.

180
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,040
 Su Wei'an, you really are quite daring.

181
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,700
I just found out that for the past three years, you haven't been studying in Paris. You were in Lakaya!

182
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,860
I just found out that for the past three years, you haven't been studying in Paris. You were in Lakaya!

183
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,700
 How could you hide this from Sister Lan and me for three years?

184
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,060
Just wait. You'll need to explain this when we meet.

185
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,119
 Hey, wait.

186
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,180
You didn't tell Sister Lan that I'm in Lakaya, right?

187
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,820
 Are you afraid I'll tell your mom?

188
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,440
 Then come and pick me up quickly.

189
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,320
But I have to deliver alcohol to the General's residence right now.

190
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,840
You'll have to wait for about an hour.

191
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,580
Don't you know French though? You can take the airport shuttle.

192
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,300
Hello?

193
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
 Wei'an?

194
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,260
Jiang Jiang, I'll send you the address. Be careful.

195
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,840

196
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,860
 Your father, Su Jianguo, passed away en route to the hospital.

197
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,000
 It's been determined that your father was fully responsible for this accident.

198
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,760
Hey, don't move!

199
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,480
Put him down!

200
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,940
Are you a doctor?

201
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,180
There's a doctor here. Lord, there's hope.

202
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,306
 Unilateral pupil dilation and dyspnea.

203
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,460
 Oh no. It's probably a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage.

204
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,920
 It's very likely that high intracranial pressure will cause brain herniation.

205
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,420
Where's the nearest hospital?

206
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,600
Downtown. It's an hour and a half away by car.

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,720
An hour and a half...

208
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,260
- Is he going to die? 
 - What to do?

209
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,880
- I think he'll die. 
 - What should we do?

210
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,280
The patient is experiencing ventricular fibrillation.

211
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,780
Dr. Gu, the patient is in V-fib.

212
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,020
The defibrillator.

213
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,360
Defibrillator!

214
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
Move aside.

215
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,320
Inject 1 mg of epinephrine.

216
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,700
Inject 1 mg of epinephrine.

217
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,420
What is she doing?

218
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,260
250 joules.

219
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,740
Charge completed.

220
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,940
Hey, wait!

221
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Don't mess around!

222
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,780
You'll kill him!

223
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,020
Stop, I'm saving him!

224
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,960
250 joules. Let's try again.

225
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,380
- She's not a doctor. 
 - She's the devil!

226
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,400
Call the police!

227
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,720
This is murder! Call the police!

228
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,260
I'll call the police.

229
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,140
Don't let her escape.

230
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,500
300 joules.

231
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,300
The patient has regained a sinus rhythm. Heart rate is 65, and oxygen saturation is 92%.

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,390
- Continue the surgery. 
 - Yes.

233
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,040
- Continue the surgery. 
 - Yes.

234
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,340
Take him to the hospital.

235
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,060
Craniocerebral reconstruction is done.

236
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,620
Fang Mingfan, I'll leave the rest to you.

237
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,220
Don't worry.

238
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,000
My husband went back to his hometown.

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,800
I drove his car here for him.

240
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,240
No...

241
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,620
Where's my bike?

242
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,300
Excuse me. Where's my motorbike, and my alcohol?

243
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,200
I don't know.

244
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
We didn't see it either.

245
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,000
There she is. Let's go.

246
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,720
My motorcycle and alcohol are missing.

247
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Madam, you're suspected of murder.

248
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,700
What are you doing?

249
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,200
You're mistaken!

250
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,580
Boss, you've worked hard.

251
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,500
This is my treasured Dendrobium officinale from 1982.

252
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,300
I especially brought it over from home.

253
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,700
It helps the stomach, promotes fluid production, nourishes yin, and reduces heat.

254
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,520
Please accept it.

255
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Fang Mingfan.

256
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Boss.

257
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
Please give me some more time.

258
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
I understand.

259
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,920
- Next time, I definitely will— 
 - Escaping isn't the answer.

260
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,200
Do you plan to spend the rest of your life being my first assistant?

261
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,720
Emergency case coming in.

262
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,380
The alcohol smell is so strong.

263
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,600
He drank so much and still drove?

264
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,340
Send his blood sample to the lab.

265
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
Get him to the operating room immediately.

266
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,360
Okay.

267
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm innocent. I'm innocent!

268
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,100
I was saving him, not killing him.

269
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,660
I'm innocent! Officer!

270
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,260
- You're so loud. 
 - I'm innocent, officer!

271
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,700
Shut up! You're so loud.

272
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,300
This person positioned it by hand without a CT scan.

273
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,200
There's actually such an expert neurosurgeon in Langkaya?

274
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,320
This doesn't count as "expert."

275
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,040
Is the position of this hole still not precise enough?

276
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
The left rear of the brain was the direct impact point.

277
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,360
The severe impact caused a contusion to the right frontal region.

278
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,660
The rupture of intracranial blood vessels led to heavy bleeding.

279
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:47,240
The rescuer must have realized that the patient's intracranial pressure was too high to make it to the hospital.

280
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,360
That’s why they did emergency treatment.

281
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,700
It was done quite steadily and precisely.

282
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,240
You still don't think this counts as "expert?"

283
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,640
Thanks to this hole, the intracranial pressure decreased, buying us more time.

284
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
The bones were shattered to this extent.

285
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,620
They dared to perform a craniotomy with such rusty skills. It was most likely an impetuous quack with limited abilities.

286
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,600
Lion-hearted, eagle-eyed, and with the gentleness of a woman's hands.

287
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,700
This quack has at least the first two qualities to become a master surgeon.

288
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
I'd really like to meet this person.

289
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,540
It really is interesting.

290
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,840
Officers.

291
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,780
I really was saving him.

292
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,140
If you don't believe me, you can ask a neurosurgeon.

293
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,180
Don't worry.

294
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,040
I've already informed the FBI to glance over your case.

295
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,884
When can I leave?

296
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,520
Be patient, young lady.

297
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,883
The evidence and testimonies against you are rock-solid.

298
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,180
The only good news is no one died.

299
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:01,340
The district court will hear your case in three months for attempted murder

300
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,440
and you can apply for bail then.

301
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,860
Three months?

302
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,760
Young lady, I advise you to get used to this place.

303
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,040
 I'll miss so many chances to earn money.

304
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,500
 If I don't deliver the General's Moutai, he'll hunt me down.

305
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,280
Officer. Officer!

306
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,080
Which hospital did they take him to?

307
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,440
Friendship Hospital.

308
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,120
Officer! Can you lend me a phone so I can make a call?

309
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,280
$100 isn't even enough?

310
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,180
So greedy.

311
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,680
Wait for a moment.

312
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,500

313
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,600
What kind of life is Su Wei'an living?

314
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,353
Hello, Wei'an. I'm in front of your house.

315
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,840
Are you sure you gave me the right address?

316
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,104
Jiang Jiang, listen to me. I've been accused of murder and I'm at the police station.

317
00:24:00,104 --> 00:24:01,470
Murder?!

318
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,540
 Go to Friendship Hospital's Neurosurgery Department right now and find an emergency patient just admitted today.

319
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,840
He was in a car accident due to drunk driving and had a hole drilled in his head.

320
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,980
 No matter what, you must find his surgeon and bring him to the East District Police Station.

321
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,400
 Only he can prove that I wasn't killing the patient.

322
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,720
Time’s up.

323
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,220
- Don't forget. Friendship Hospital's Neurosurgery Department. 
 - Time's up!

324
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,440
Hello?

325
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,860
My goodness.

326
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,640
 Friendship Hospital's Neurosurgery Department.

327
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,400

328
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,240

329
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,127
Hello! Hello.

330
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:43,580
Are you here to apply for the translator job?

331
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,480
No. I wanted to ask if there was an emergency patient who got sent here today with a hole drilled in his head.

332
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,360
- You mean the one from the car accident? 
 - Yes!

333
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,020
What's your relationship with the patient?

334
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,421
I'm looking for his surgeon.

335
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:57,160
His surgeon is Dr. Gu.

336
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,240
You need him for something?

337
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,780
Yes, it's very urgent. Someone's life is at stake.

338
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,580
Can you please find him for me?

339
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,180
Don't panic. Go sit down, I'll call him right away.

340
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,420
Thank you! Please hurry.

341
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm sorry.

342
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,320
I'm so sorry.

343
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,840
It's okay.

344
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,520
Are... are you Chinese?

345
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,580
Are you seeing a doctor or visiting someone?

346
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,680
Do you know Dr. Gu from Neurosurgery?

347
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,940
I need him to save a life.

348
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,440
Save a life?

349
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,740
Are you not feeling well?

350
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,620
- I'm also from neurosurgery. 
 - It's not me.

351
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,980
I just need the surgeon who treated the patient with a hole drilled in his head.

352
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,340
I must see him, and no one else.

353
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,940
You can talk to me as well.

354
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,620
I also took part in that surgery.

355
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,200
No. My friend said that I have to find the lead surgeon.

356
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,320
Are you the lead surgeon?

357
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,760
Dr. Gu is very busy.

358
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,160
But he leaves all non-patient-related matters to me.

359
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,042
Who's looking for me?

360
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,360
I am, Doctor.

361
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,740
Please come with me to the East District Police Station.

362
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,963
My friend was arrested by the police while providing first aid. She was accused of murder.

363
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:33,800
You're that patient's lead surgeon, so you need to come with me and prove that she's innocent.

364
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,935
Fang Mingfan, figure out what's going on.

365
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:39,920
If it's necessary, give her a written explanation of the situation.

366
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,060
- Okay. 
 - No, Dr. Gu.

367
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,120
It is a doctor's sacred duty to save lives.

368
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,000
How can you turn away when a life is at stake?

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
So please don't waste my time when I'm saving lives.

370
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,200
Investigating and gathering evidence to find out the truth is the police's job.

371
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,940
If the police here were useful, my friend wouldn't have been wrongly accused.

372
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,160
You're the one who knows best whether my friend, by drilling a hole in that man's head, harmed him or saved him.

373
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Your friend drilled that hole?

374
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,400
Yes.

375
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,720
Wait a moment. I'll take care of some urgent matters and then I'll go with you.

376
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,960
Wait, Boss. You never meddle in other people's business. Why...

377
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,320
Fang Mingfan, where's the blood test report I asked you to pick up?

378
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,940
Give it to me.

379
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,020
Wei'an!

380
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,060
- Jiang Jiang! 
 - My gosh, are you okay?

381
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,540
- I'm fine. 
 - You scared me to death!

382
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,840
Where's the person I asked you to find?

383
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,400
He's over there.

384
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,440
I didn't even waste a minute.

385
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,020
And he's a very handsome Chinese doctor.

386
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,500
- Mr. Gu. 
 - Officer.

387
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,100
Your testimony and blood test results have been received.

388
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,180
You are good to go.

389
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,240
That gentleman, is he okay now?

390
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,740
You're mistaken.

391
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,180
It's not a gentleman. It's that crazy lady over there.

392
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,900
It's you.

393
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,800
What a coincidence, Dr. Gu.

394
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:36,837
Thank you for testifying for me.

395
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
You two know each other?

396
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,920
It's fate.

397
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,440
You're a doctor?

398
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,000
She's a medical student at Huaren Medical University, and did her bachelor and master's degrees in eight years. Cool, right?

399
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,380
You're a doctoral student at Huaren?

400
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,080
Yes.

401
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,860
Then why are you an unlicensed taxi driver here?

402
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,040
What year were you?

403
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,980
How long has it been since you graduated?

404
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,120
I-I didn't graduate. I dropped out.

405
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,080
You dropped out? Why?

406
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,400
Then you have no clinical experience.

407
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,700
And when you were administering first aid earlier, you didn't have any remote professional guidance.

408
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,279
I got my physician qualification certificate.

409
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,940
I've had specialized training in neurosurgery before.

410
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,300
But still no experience.

411
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,900
Weren't you afraid that you could have made a mistake and caused the patient to die on the spot?

412
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,580
If that happened, how would you take responsibility?

413
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,420
Isn't he still alive?

414
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,540
You were just lucky.

415
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,540
No wonder you dropped out.

416
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't think you have any respect for medicine and human life.

417
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
Don't worry.

418
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,220
If he died, I would've compensated him with my own life.

419
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,240
Is your life not valuable?

420
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,580
What exactly does life mean to you?

421
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:15,165
Is this the way Huaren Medical University teaches you to be responsible for human lives?

422
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,960
Just sign this document and you go.

423
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,160
Are you Gu Yunzheng from Huaren?

424
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,340
Thank you.

425
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,925
Wasn't Gu Yunzheng your professor—

426
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:47,845
Su Wei'an.

427
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,180
 What happened to that man? Did he pass out?

428
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,380
 He had a seizure.

429
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,060
 He was lucky that Dr. Su was here.

430
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,620
 He's going to the hospital now.

431
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,760
 Dr. Su?

432
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,420
 I got used to calling her that. She's a student at Huaren Medical University.

433
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,280
 She forgot her book!

434
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,580
 This is the last subject of her final exams.

435
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,300

436
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,200

437
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,720

438
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,620
For practicing medicine without a license, you can pay a fine of $1,000 and then leave.

439
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,240
I have a medical license.

440
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,620
Su Wei'an?

441
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,140
Su Wei'an from the Clinical Medicine Class of 2012?

442
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,780
Professor Gu, you still remember me.

443
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,360
It's because I haven't met many students who missed an exam because they were saving people.

444
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,420
At that time, your name impressed me deeply.

445
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,720
Su Wei'an, I thought you would become an excellent doctor. I didn't expect you to drop out.

446
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,340
Su Wei'an, I thought you would become an excellent doctor. I didn't expect you to drop out.

447
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,040
Why did you drop out?

448
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,220
Studying medicine was too hard and I had no money, so I gave up.

449
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,200
Hurry up and pay the fine.

450
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,960
Can you give me a discount?

451
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,700
50% off? What about 500 dollars?

452
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,220
- Is that okay? 
 - You're allowed to negotiate?

453
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,820
- Okay? 
 - I don't think it'll work.

454
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,680
Please.

455
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,820
What's the matter?

456
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,080
Where's the money?

457
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,300
Where's my money?

458
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,460
Oh no, I didn't bring enough cash either.

459
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,709
Dr. Gu, you must have some money.

460
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,129
Please help your compatriot.

461
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,140
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

462
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,440
Thank you, Professor Gu.

463
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,120
You don't have to thank me or call me your professor.

464
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,600
My students never give up halfway.

465
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,040
Su Wei'an, if I catch you providing treatment without permission again,

466
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,680
I will cooperate with the police to bring you to justice.

467
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
Keep that in mind.

468
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,680
Dr. Gu, we'll pay you back.

469
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,260
Hello, Sister Hong.

470
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,340
Hello, Boss Zhou.

471
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,070
Hey Brother, do you still have Moutai in your store?

472
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,460
Those bottles of Moutai I ordered for you last month, can I buy them back?

473
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,840
You drank all three boxes?

474
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,951
Only one bottle?

475
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,380
Two bottles? Okay.

476
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,040
Fake... No fake ones. I don't sell fake—

477
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,756
You know the General is an expert on China.

478
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:50,040
He'll find out immediately.

479
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,210
Name a price.

480
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,460
What a rip-off.

481
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,600
It's such a hassle to get some alcohol.

482
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,360
Su Wei'an, do you still see me as a friend?

483
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,960
Today, I flew halfway across the world to see you, and spent the whole day running around for you.

484
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,880
- I even used my acting skills to cry for you, and you won't even look at me in the eye? 
 - My bad.

485
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,560
My bad. Here, have some prawns.

486
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,020
You love prawns.

487
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,420
Stop it. Be honest.

488
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,340
What's going on?

489
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,860
It's just...

490
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,020
- I lost General Kouyate's alcohol and now I— 
 - Stop.

491
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,980
Did I ask you about that?

492
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,400
I'm talking about Gu Yunzheng.

493
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,180
Dr. Gu. Professor Gu.

494
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,220
Spit it out. Do you have feelings for him?

495
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,780
That's enough, Jiang Muying.

496
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm in big trouble now. How can I even think about that?

497
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,640
If the General gets angry, things will get out of hand.

498
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,380
Fine. I won't ask you about Gu Yunzheng anymore.

499
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,420
Let's talk about you now.

500
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,700
- What's wrong with me? 
 - Don't pretend.

501
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,780
You're in Lakaya, so why did you lie to us about being in Paris?

502
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,520
Also, when did you drop out? And why?

503
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,280
Didn’t I make everything clear at the police station earlier?

504
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,640
It's hard and it makes no money, right?

505
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
That's right.

506
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,520
Only Gu Yunzheng would believe that. I won't fall for it.

507
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,060
You've wanted to be a doctor ever since you were little.

508
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,640
And now you're saying you probably won't make much money in medicine, so you want to quit.

509
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,080
Do you really think I'd believe that, Su Wei'an?

510
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,260
And you, Su Wei'an, have never been like the people who love money.

511
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,020
I do love money. Very much.

512
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,980
You even had to come all the way to Lakaya and risk your life to earn money.

513
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,060
Is it because of what happened with your thesis that year?

514
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,240
Of course not.

515
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,700
Then is it because of your father's accident?

516
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,200
Jiang Jiang, people always change.

517
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,200
I just want to earn money now and enjoy life.

518
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,140
I don't want to suffer every day in that medical school, and work so hard without earning much money.

519
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,000
Don't stay here and torture yourself anymore, okay? Go back to China with me.

520
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,480
Jiang Jiang, I know. I know you care a lot about me.

521
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,680
But...

522
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,500
I just need a lot of money right now, the more the better.

523
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,160
Okay, then I'll earn the money with you.

524
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,240
I've loved following you around ever since I was a kid anyway.

525
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,520
This time is no different. I only bought a one-way ticket.

526
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,220
It's either you come back with me, or I'll stay here with you.

527
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,760
I won't leave without you.

528
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,260
You won't leave without me?

529
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,820
Are you kidding me? Can your employer grant you such a long leave?

530
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,185
Well, I quit my job.

531
00:38:01,185 --> 00:38:04,085
Again?

532
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:06,120
My goodness.

533
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,620
The rental income from our family's real estate allows me to earn money effortlessly.

534
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,780
Why endure humiliation for a salary of just a few thousand?

535
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,040
I don't want that, so I decided to quit.

536
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,920
In two days? No, that won't do.

537
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,260
If I can't get it tonight, I'll be dead meat.

538
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,460
So what's wrong, Su Wei'an? You need to get enough alcohol for the General by tonight?

539
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,720
You only managed to get this many after working all evening.

540
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,700
Did you ask the airport duty-free shops?

541
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,160
We can have someone go and buy it.

542
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,120
It's not that easy. The General is an expert on China.

543
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,420
The Moutai in the duty-free shops are all exported.

544
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,020
He wants the original Moutai.

545
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:56,020
Then what can we do?

546
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,720
We're here.

547
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,400
- Who's that? 
 - I don't know.

548
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm afraid to answer. They've been calling me all night.

549
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,280
Jiang Jiang, why don't you just buy a ticket and go back? I don't want to get you involved.

550
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,320
The General's people are scary.

551
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,000
But I just got here. I'm not leaving.

552
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,200
Get out of the way. Move!

553
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,930
What's going on?

554
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Hurry.

555
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,760
- No. 
 - What's wrong?

556
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Get out of the way. Move!

557
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
- Go there now! 
 - Who are they?

558
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,960
- The General's people. 
 - Go there now!

559
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,980
- There's a box here. 
 - There are so many people.

560
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,465
There's only one box.

561
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,860
You! Put this box into the car.

562
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,100
Catch that woman and bring her back.

563
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,140
Hide yourself.

564
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Break through the door.

565
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
No, you can't!

566
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,180
All my money is in there.

567
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,410
- Is money more important than your life? 
 - Enter.

568
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,780
Go, search!

569
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,610
Look at that, we have to take some.

570
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,940
What are you doing?

571
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,600
My snacks and my chili sauce!

572
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
Seriously? Chili sauce?

573
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,460
Your mom asked me to bring it to you.

574
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,200
You.

575
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,680
- Just stand there. 
 - Yes.

576
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,220
Notify all locations. If Su Wei'an is seen, report to the General immediately.

577
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,520
Go!

578
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,940
Let's go.

579
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,320
My money. My shop.

580
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,360
This is too scary.

581
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,920
Jiang Jiang, we won't be able to go back tonight.

582
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,060
The General's people just said that I screwed up his banquet tonight, so they will catch me.

583
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,760
The General's people just said that I screwed up his banquet tonight, so they will catch me.

584
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,320
Why are the General's people like gangsters?

585
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,184
We can just pay him back.

586
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:44,300
How could they just break into your home?

587
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,400
I'll call the police.

588
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,980
What can the police do?

589
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,120
He's like an emperor here. He isn't scared of anyone.

590
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,460
Then where are we going to spend the night?

591
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,420
We'll have to find a hotel.

592
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,440
The General has already ordered that no place can accept me.

593
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,140
They'll take me away the moment they see me.

594
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,180
Where can we go then?

595
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,260
 Hello! Hello.

596
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,540
 Are you here to apply for the translator job?

597
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,740
I know a safe place where we can go.

598
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,420
You do? It's only your first day here.

599
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,020
Let's go.

600
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:21,438
Come with me.

601
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,058

602
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,140
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

603
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,560
I think I'd better go back and apologize to the General.

604
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,520
He can't really kill me.

605
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,380
No, you can't.

606
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,640
You're not even afraid of the General, yet you're afraid of the hospital?

607
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,242
Your shop is ruined and your business is gone now.

608
00:42:39,242 --> 00:42:41,420
This is the best and safest place.

609
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,620
Also, aren't you all about making money now?

610
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,420
They pay you weekly, and it's a good salary.

611
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,140
What could be better for you than this French translator job?

612
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,820
No.

613
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:11,030

614
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,060

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:30,020
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫
