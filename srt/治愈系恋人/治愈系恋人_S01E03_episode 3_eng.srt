 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,260
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,380
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:49,300
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,380

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,080

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,830
Sakun.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,800
Is it cute?

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,300
Here.

19
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,200
It's for you.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,940
Daddy.

21
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,300
What did you call me?

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,500
Sakun, let go of Dr. Gu.

23
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you have a touch disorder and don't like being touched?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,140
Talk to the kid and tell him that I want to give him a check-up.

25
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,600
Daddy, make money.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Make money?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
You taught him that?

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,060
He's so young. How can he just call anyone mommy and daddy?

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you teach him to commit money fraud?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,560
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,420
Sakun grew up with no family.

32
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,100
He'll call anyone who treats him well mommy or daddy.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,140
He's so young, but you've already tainted him with the smell of money.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
What's wrong with making money?

35
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,200
He can only treat his illness if he has money.

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,460
Sakun, be good.

37
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,420
No, no, no.

38
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
It's okay.

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,020
He's scared of injections and medicine.

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,808
Little man! Listen to me.

41
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:11,700
Right now, you must take medicine every day.

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,540
Even though your illness can't be cured yet,

43
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,800
it's possible that tomorrow or next year,

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,260
we'll have a new specific medicine or a new way to treat it.

45
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,400
So right now, you must keep going with the treatment.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,720
 Can all diseases really be cured?

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,600
In fact, many people around you are hanging in there and working hard with you.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,400
So you really can't give up.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,940
You have to cheer up, and hang in there.

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,600
Cheer up!

51
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,840
Please translate what I just said for the kid.

52
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,145
What's the matter?

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
Su Wei'an.

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,980
Translate it.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,180
Sakun.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,410
Let Dr. Gu take a look at you.

57
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,680
- I'll take you out afterwards, okay? 
 - I want some Coke.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
No problem.

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,380
Lie down.

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,700
I said so much just now, and you only translated a sentence or two?

61
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,580
You're too wordy. Do your checkup.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,480
Very good.

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,640
Sakun, I'll buy you a Coke when your headache goes away.

64
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,700
Give me five.

65
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,160
Mommy An, hurry and get in.

66
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Let's go.

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,180
Why are you dressed like this?

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,280
I don't want any gossip about us to spread.

69
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,600
Neither do I.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Then why did you promise to take Sakun out?

71
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,080
He's a good boy. He's very cooperative with treatment.

72
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,180
I can't break my promise to such a young kid.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,760
Well, there are so many kids who cooperate. Will you satisfy all their demands?

74
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,420
Ever since he had surgery, his mom has never come to see him.

75
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,700
And he's still so young.

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,920
He must be very lonely and sad.

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,260
So you give him special treatment because you empathize with his mom's absence?

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,480
Does there have to be a reason?

79
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,600
You also give him special treatment. What's your reason?

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,700
Does there have to be a reason?

81
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,780
Sakun, Dr. Gu is very busy, but he'll spend the whole day with you. You're going to get rich.

82
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,360
Get rich and make money!

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,940
Let's go.

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,740
Is this the feast you guys have been talking about?

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,080
Yes.

86
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,520
This is Lakaya's most famous food street.

87
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,880
You can find everything here, and you can eat it all.

88
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,300
- Be careful. 
 - Mommy An, there's popcorn here.

89
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,720
Do you want some?

90
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,200
Yes.

91
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll pay for this.

92
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,108
Be careful!

93
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,920
 We're already halfway through the exam, so you can't take it anymore. You can make it up next month.

94
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,130
 I can't make it up.

95
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,060
 I have to be in the top three for eight consecutive years to have a chance at Huaren Hospital.

96
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,340
 I didn't mean to be late. I was taking a patient to the hospital.

97
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,820
 Taking a patient to the hospital?

98
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,540
 - Yes. 
 - Can anyone prove it?

99
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,140
 I can.

100
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,320
 She was helping a patient who had an epileptic seizure, so she missed the exam.

101
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,060
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

102
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,720
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

103
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,860
♫  And trapped in this city called fate,  ♫

104
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,220
♫  yet we're still chasing star  ♫

105
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,160
Sakun, are you okay?

106
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,700
Thank you, Professor Gu.

107
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,100
Su Wei'an, why do you risk your life in everything you do?

108
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,500
Before taking care of others, can you take care of yourself first?

109
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,900
Such individualistic heroism.

110
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,700
Has anyone ever told you that you're more handsome when you stay quiet?

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,820
S-Sakun, don't run around!

112
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,160
For you.

113
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,360
What's this?

114
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,060
It's a local specialty, high-protein fried meatballs.

115
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,960
They're crispy and fragrant.

116
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,560
High-protein fried meatballs?

117
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,980
I'll try it then.

118
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,480
Eat it.

119
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,920
Let's enjoy it together. Eat it.

120
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,540
- It's for you. 
 - You eat it!

121
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,600
- You eat it. 
 - You eat it first.

122
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,220
Deep-fried spiders are very delicious.

123
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,640
Your fish is ready.

124
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,280
I told you to eat it.

125
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,080
W-What's wrong?

126
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,220
Charcoal ash.

127
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,140
Are you guys a family?

128
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,900
No, we're not.

129
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,840
Daddy, I want to eat fish. I want fish.

130
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Sakun, you can't call me that.

131
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,920
I don't accept this.

132
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,260
Slow down, Sakun.

133
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,180
Sakun! Sakun.

134
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,880
Let me take a look.

135
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,480
This is bad.

136
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,200
His coagulation function is poor, so the bleeding won't stop on its own.

137
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,840
Put my clothes on it. Don't touch his blood.

138
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,300
Don't be scared, Sakun.

139
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,780
- Come on. 
 - Be careful.

140
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,920
He's HIV-positive.

141
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,400
He needs sutures. Get ready.

142
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,020
I'll go disinfect myself.

143
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,240
Here, I'll put it on for you.

144
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,640
Put on another pair.

145
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,780
Here we go.

146
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,820

147
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,620
The power's out?

148
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,680
Dr. Zhang?

149
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,080
You scared me to death!

150
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Jiang Jiang, it's me. It's okay.

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,720
The power's out. What are you doing out here?

152
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,340
I was just writing my paper and I got tired.

153
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,220
The power went out, so I came out to get some fresh air.

154
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,100
You... Why are you by yourself?

155
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,960
Where's Su Wei'an?

156
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,060
I haven't seen her all day.

157
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,600
And when I called her, she didn't want to say anything.

158
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
I have no idea what she's up to.

159
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,800
She must be busy making money.

160
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,340
What else could she be doing?

161
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,780
As long as you can reach her, it's fine.

162
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,020
Didn't you get your Ph.D. and start working already? Why are you still writing papers?

163
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,200
Academician Qiu Fazu once said, "Being good at performing surgeries isn't enough."

164
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,080
"Medicine must focus on both clinical practice and scientific research."

165
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Also, after working under Boss over the years, I've come to agree more with what he said.

166
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,480
"Scientific research ability affects clinical thinking."

167
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,540
"If you want to realize your medical dream, you must study throughout your life."

168
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,420
W-Why are you looking at me like that?

169
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,380
I envy you.

170
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,020
It's true.

171
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,300
Anyone who has a dream can shine.

172
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,280
So based on what you're saying, everyone can shine, since everyone has a dream.

173
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,720
I don't have any dreams.

174
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,720
I used to just be Wei'an's follower.

175
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,660
I would follow her wherever she went.

176
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,380
She was an excellent student, and she pushed me to study hard every day.

177
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,580
So I also got into a pretty good college.

178
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,720
She wanted to study medicine, and I just followed her.

179
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,920
But I studied veterinary medicine, so I was far behind her.

180
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,500
That's not true.

181
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm serious.

182
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,900
Later on, she started to learn French, so I learned some too.

183
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,160
But I wasn't as good at it as she was.

184
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,900
And then one day, she suddenly said she wanted to study abroad in France, in Paris.

185
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,400
This time, I really couldn't follow her anymore.

186
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,980
When I found out that Wei'an wasn't even in Paris,

187
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,440
and that she even dropped out of school and gave up on her lifelong dream,

188
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
I totally panicked.

189
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,560
Even Wei'an gave up, so what should I do?

190
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,380
Don't you think I'm quite terrible?

191
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,320
Not at all.

192
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,660
Life is such a long journey.

193
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,300
One day, you'll stop being a blind follower, and you'll find out what you really want.

194
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,980
But the problem is, I don't really know what I can do.

195
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,260
Everyone has their own hobbies and areas of expertise.

196
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,460
You just need time to discover them.

197
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:03,360
Although Su Wei'an is very smart, I'm sure you have some strengths that she doesn't have.

198
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,320
What strengths? Tell me more.

199
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,840
You're very good to your friends.

200
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,840
What kind of strength is that? I thought you were being serious.

201
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,300
This definitely counts as a strength.

202
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,460
Many people are good to their friends,

203
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,660
but very few put their friends before themselves.

204
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,420
I remember your eyes were already red that day,

205
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,720
and you still stood up to Boss and forced him to go to the police station to save Su Wei'an.

206
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,560
You were so cool.

207
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,540
And I think Su Wei'an is also very lucky because she has a friend like you.

208
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,700
You almost made me cry.

209
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,660
All right. Then starting today, my friend list

210
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,400
includes a new male friend with the last name Fang.

211
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,440
A little higher.

212
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,340
A little further to the right.

213
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,660
It's done.

214
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,860
You... Are you okay?

215
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,740
How can you fall on flat ground? Do you have ataxia?

216
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,160
Who has ataxia?

217
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,540
It's hypoglycemia.

218
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,460
Are you really okay?

219
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,500
What about you?

220
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Check yourself again for any cuts.

221
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,800
You worried about me?

222
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,740
I don't.

223
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,340
Don't worry.

224
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,980
I don't have any wounds.

225
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,340
And we all have to take blocking drugs anyway.

226
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm hungry.

227
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,340
Come on. Let's go eat together.

228
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,020
Here you go. Try it.

229
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,340
It's too late now.

230
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,680
This is all that's left in the cafeteria.

231
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,080
Su Wei'an, what's the matter?

232
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:17,160
Back in the day, my dad also liked to place two fried eggs on top of noodles.

233
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,380
Your dad?

234
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,240
He...

235
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,680
Three years ago,

236
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,920
he became a star in the sky.

237
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,180
Is that why you dropped out of school?

238
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,880
Of course not.

239
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,580
It has nothing to do with my dad.

240
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,980
I just wanted to make money. Lots of money.

241
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,440
There are many opportunities in Lakaya, and you can earn money quickly.

242
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,300
There's gold everywhere.

243
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,340
And you know what?

244
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,580
Europeans are very generous with their tips.

245
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,950
Su Wei'an, is your family short of money?

246
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,180
Who would be bothered by having too much money?

247
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:17,200
If you really value money so much, would you risk your final exam just to save someone's life?

248
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,820
Would you be willing to save someone even if it made you look like a murderer?

249
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,780
Do you believe it?

250
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,020
I don't believe it.

251
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,020
Anyways, between studying medicine and making money, I choose to make money.

252
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,900
Su Wei'an, did you make a lot of money in Lakaya?

253
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,980
Is it enough to pay for Sakun's medical bills?

254
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm curious, why are you so contradictory?

255
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,840
Professor Gu. You... Do you agree with Darwin's theory of evolution?

256
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,380
You mean...

257
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,680
Natural selection and survival of the fittest.

258
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,460
And that defective genes should be naturally eliminated.

259
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,160
I only believe in the Hippocratic Oath. 
  (T/N: traditional an oath taken by physicians.)

260
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll always maintain the greatest respect and care for every life.

261
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,780
So then...

262
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,560
you've never experienced the desperate moment when you see that your patient can never be cured, right?

263
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,100
As doctors, we have no right to despair.

264
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,800
We... We must fight until the last moment and never give up.

265
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,800
It's all your fault. Who said we could chat for so long?

266
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,300
The dining hall is closed now, so who's going to make our late-night snack?

267
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,340
Su Wei'an, what are you doing?

268
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,960
We can't be seen together.

269
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,200
Why can't we be seen together?

270
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,480
Yes, why?

271
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,200
What are you afraid of?

272
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm already hiding. It'll be weird to come out now.

273
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,000
There isn't a single person around.

274
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,760
Look, Boss is here.

275
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,680
Boss.

276
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,440
Dr. Gu, what are you doing here?

277
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,300
I... I'm hungry.

278
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,780
Who's eating noodles with you?

279
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,580
Where's the person?

280
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,140
There's no one else. It's just me.

281
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,620
Then why are there two bowls of noodles?

282
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,300
I want to eat two bowls.

283
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,420
Is that not allowed?

284
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,100
But it looks like both pairs of chopsticks have been used.

285
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,440
I like to use one pair for each bowl.

286
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,140
Something wrong with that?

287
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,740
Okay, sure.

288
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,840
Boss, where have you been all day?

289
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,800
It seems like it was even your first day off since you've been here.

290
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,780
I didn't see you all day, and I'm not used to it.

291
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,680
Same here.

292
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,240
I haven't seen Wei'an all day, and I'm not used to it either.

293
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,620
Boss, you two...

294
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,720
What's wrong with us two?

295
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,200
I wasn't with Su Wei'an.

296
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,400
I rarely have afternoons off, so I just hung around.

297
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,100
Boss, I wasn't asking about you and Interpreter Su.

298
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,640
I was asking about you and Interpreter Jiang.

299
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,540
Do you two want scallion pancakes or dumplings?

300
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,340
I'll eat noodles.

301
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,440
Have a seat, Jiang Jiang.

302
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,580
I'll go get you some scallion pancakes.

303
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
Dr. Gu,

304
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,340
are you okay?

305
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,420
Why do I feel like you're nervous?

306
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,440
I... I'm not nervous.

307
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,000
I... Am I nervous?

308
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,420
I'm not.

309
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
It smells so good.

310
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,820
Here. Try it, Jiang Muying.

311
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,620
Scallion pancakes made by the auntie in the cafeteria are amazing.

312
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,020
It's already so late.

313
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,820
Why isn't Wei'an back yet?

314
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,420
Why isn't she back yet?

315
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Why don't you call her?

316
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,820
If all else fails, I'll go with you to pick her up.

317
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
What's that noise?

318
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,140
I... I received an SMS.

319
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,680
SMS.

320
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,300
Gosh, it's so hot!

321
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,620
I was careless.

322
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,500
I'll pick it up!

323
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,040
Let me do it.

324
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,340
This isn't hot at all.

325
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,400
I have sensitive hands.

326
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,880
Jiang Muying. Su Wei'an is very daring, isn't she?

327
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,440
She dares to go out alone at night.

328
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,980
Has General Kouyate's anger subsided?

329
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,100
- She... 
 - Oh no!

330
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,440
The phone rang and was immediately hung up, right?

331
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,780
Could she have been captured by General Kouyate?

332
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,380
No, I have to go. I have to go find her.

333
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:13,400
Fang Mingfan. Jiang Muying is going out alone at night to look for Su Wei'an.

334
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,240
Lakaya is so unsafe, aren't you worried about her?

335
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,780
Wait for me, Jiang Jiang!

336
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Why did you scare Jiang Jiang?

337
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,800
She'll really go out to look for me.

338
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,380
If I didn't drive her away, would you have the chance to blame me right now?

339
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,800
You can call her immediately and tell her to come back.

340
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,280
Right.

341
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,540
Hello, Jiang Jiang.

342
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,720
I... I'm fine.

343
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,340
I just ran into an old customer on the way back, so we had some late-night snacks.

344
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,580
I'm coming back now. Wait for me in the room.

345
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,580
Bye.

346
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760
I'll head out first.

347
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,740
Take it easy.

348
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,640

349
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,700

350
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,040

351
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,760
How can you randomly look at other people's things?

352
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,200
I didn't even know whose it was.

353
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,240
Then you definitely shouldn't have looked at it.

354
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,380
Since I didn't know its owner, I had to find out who it belonged to so I could return it to them.

355
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,860
So what did you see in it?

356
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,900
What did I see?

357
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,640
I saw someone's determination to make money and their ability to calculate in everything.

358
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,500
I'm sure she'll become rich before she turns sixty.

359
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,880
Su Wei'an, I'm really starting to believe that you're willing to give up your doctor dream just to make money.

360
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,680
But to give up living your dream just because of money,

361
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,580
isn't that faint and weak?

362
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,800
When we were in the operating room earlier,

363
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,100
the way you held the flashlight made me feel like you were one of us.

364
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,260
Su Wei'an, what exactly are you thinking?

365
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,680
I still remember what you said when we were stargazing.

366
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:21,180
"The light of the stars is very sad, just like our memories of a person who has passed away."

367
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,820
But this is what I think. Even though they're destined to die,

368
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,540
the stars are still trying their best

369
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,140
and using their last bit of power to leave the brightest light in the night sky.

370
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:40,500
Just like the stars, we're all destined to die.

371
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,380
But the value of our lives in this world

372
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,200
is comparable to the enduring light of the stars, shining forever.

373
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,920
You're right, Professor Gu.

374
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,140
But I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

375
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,480
Making money is my only dream.

376
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:09,080
And I hope that with your blessing, I can live my subdued life until my sixties.

377
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,140
You're back.

378
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
You must be exhausted.

379
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,060
Here, I'll give you a massage.

380
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,220
Come here.

381
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,840
How's the pressure?

382
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,620
It's good.

383
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,690
So relaxing.

384
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,780
In the future, take me with you when you go out, okay?

385
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,370
I can also help share your burdens,

386
00:31:54,884 --> 00:31:57,894
including that late-night snack.

387
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,420
I knew you had other motives.

388
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,130
If I didn't run into Dr. Gu in the dining hall today, I would've thought you two went out together.

389
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,090
How's that possible?

390
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,430
He doesn't like me. Don't you know?

391
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,340
I don't know.

392
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,860
I actually think you stir up his emotions quite well.

393
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,240
Isn't this something special?

394
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,740
Yes.

395
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,480
It's very special.

396
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,760
It's specially annoying.

397
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,620
No, you didn't see what happened today.

398
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,140
When I saw him tonight, he looked so lonely and fragile.

399
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,680
Seemed like he's longing for love.

400
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,760
I'm serious.

401
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,540
Why do I…

402
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,580
I mean, how can you tell?

403
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,040
It's so obvious. Think about it. He's typically a cool and serious man.

404
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,720
But tonight in the dining hall, he made himself two bowls of noodles and even set out two pairs of chopsticks.

405
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,140
It shows that he's waiting for that person who will share the noodles with him.

406
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,860
Don't you think it's very touching?

407
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,760
Is it touching?

408
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,205
Why do I think it's creepy?

409
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,985
Su Wei'an!

410
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,320
How can you be so silly?

411
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,540
You really don't understand romance.

412
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,280
Jiang Jiang, Gu Yunzheng is so excellent, yet he remains single.

413
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,880
Do you think it's because he can't find someone to eat noodles with?

414
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,700
Then...

415
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,640
He's so proud that he can't think about anything else except medicine.

416
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,740
That's exactly what Fang Mingfan said.

417
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,780
He also said that Gu Yunzheng's partner is Cushing, you know?

418
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,940
What does this mean?

419
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,760
It means you know Gu Yunzheng very well, even though the two of you aren't close.

420
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,500
Maybe you're the special one he's been waiting for. I think—

421
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,410
Jiang Jiang, do you know what I envy the most about you?

422
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,300
Jiang Jiang, do you know what I envy the most about you?

423
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,020
What?

424
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,800
I envy your powerful imagination.

425
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,240
I just give you a beginning, and you can make up a whole story.

426
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,340
 Gu Yunzheng, please save him!

427
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:46,812
 You didn't have money to pay your own fine but had money to pay for a neighbor's medical bills.

428
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:48,240
 This neighbor isn't that simple.

429
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,460
 Did you make a lot of money in Lakaya?

430
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,740
 Is it enough to pay for Sakun's medical bills?

431
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,440
 Are you guys a family?

432
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,260
 No, we're not.

433
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,280
 Daddy, I want to eat fish. I want fish.

434
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,100
 Sakun, you can't call me that.

435
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,120

436
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,500
Brain pacemakers can be widely used for neurodegenerative diseases,

437
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,420
including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and so on.

438
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,020
Has Wei'an been very busy lately?

439
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,380
She hasn't been here for a whole month

440
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,020
President Du.

441
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,740
President Du?

442
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,340
Professor Wen called, stating this month’s project funds have not been requested from the finance department.

443
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,810
We've been investing in the HDQ39 project for more than two years now, but the progress is very slow.

444
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,260
Investing money in it is just a waste.

445
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,580
I looked into it, and the number of patients in the entire country with this rare disease is only about 30,000.

446
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:00,320
Even if our medicine gets to the market, how will we make a profit in the future?

447
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,800
The return on investment is too low.

448
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,860
Manager Chen, what is Jiehui's corporate philosophy?

449
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,100
Our profit target this year is twice as much as last year.

450
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,020
If HDQ39 is able to cure Huntington's disease,

451
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,940
it will surely shake the global medical community.

452
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,580
It can help Jiehui's listing plan go more smoothly.

453
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,620
The small amount of money lost on the patients can be earned back in the stock market.

454
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,740
Don't just focus on the immediate gains.

455
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,000
You're right.

456
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,780
I admire your big vision. I just didn't think it through enough.

457
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,260
I'll go to the finance department right away and take care of the issue.

458
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,260
Yes, Sir.

459
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,160
Grandpa. This is some medicinal wine from my mom.

460
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,800
Grandpa, this is Jiehui's financial report from last year.

461
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,620
Last year, Jiehui introduced a total of 12 types of medical devices.

462
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,140
- And in scientific research— 
 - This clivia isn't blooming either.

463
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,465
Grandpa, clivias don't like water.

464
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:46,450
Watering once a week is enough, which allows for flower bud differentiation.

465
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,515
Grandpa, you watered it too much.

466
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,765
No wonder.

467
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:58,340
Although Jiehui was founded after I retired,

468
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:03,940
I started the company mainly to sell a few useful patents I had.

469
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:11,040
If you didn't bring up taking over the company three years ago, it wouldn't be developing like it is now.

470
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,732
Since you took over the company, you don't have to report everything to me.

471
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,540
You can make your own decisions.

472
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,560
Thank you, Grandpa.

473
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,800
It's getting late. Go home and get some rest.

474
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,925
Take the wine with you. You coming here is good enough.

475
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,580
Xiao Zheng!

476
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,420
Yes.

477
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,400
You've been in Lakaya for over a year already.

478
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,865
Did you see enough of that place yet?

479
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,470
Come back if you're done.

480
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,055
I know, Grandpa.

481
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:48,105
The aid program this time will continue for another two months. I'll go back as soon as it ends.

482
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,855
 Sure. I'm looking forward to seeing you, okay?

483
00:38:50,855 --> 00:38:52,299
 Be sure to take care of yourself.

484
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:54,260
You too, take care of yourself.

485
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,665
 Okay, bye.

486
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,105
Bye.

487
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,240

488
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,467
Mom.

489
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,600
You're back. How did it go?

490
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,600
When you reported to Grandpa about the company today, did he praise you?

491
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,460
In the three years since you became CEO, Jiehui's profit growth rate has been the highest among all pharmaceutical companies.

492
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:26,490
Grandpa said that when making wine, you should use red or purple Lingzhi, not this black one.

493
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,810
The efficacy of black Lingzhi is even worse than that of common mushrooms.

494
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,230
Mom, don't bother making these next time.

495
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,990
You even hurt your hand while washing Lingzhi last time.

496
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,050
About Grandpa,

497
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,850
I'll take care of him myself.

498
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:43,240
You just need to take good care of yourself and Dad's health.

499
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,450
What are you talking about?

500
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,408
This means I care about him.

501
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:51,353
After your grandpa retired, he started to like collecting medicinal wine and things like that.

502
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:55,810
If he didn't bar me from entering the old house, would I have needed you to bring this to him?

503
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,660

504
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,250
Dad, I'm back.

505
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,610
You're back.

506
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:13,750
Your mom said your company’s annual report was pretty good.

507
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,610
Very good.

508
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,310
Thanks, Dad.

509
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,370
How could such a perfect pair of hands grow on you, and not on a surgeon?

510
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,450
What a shame.

511
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:38,000
Pharmaceutical companies can treat and save people, too.

512
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,980
By the way, your younger brother's aid term is ending soon.

513
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,520
Have you contacted him?

514
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,700
Did he mention when he plans to come back?

515
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,680
Both you and Yunzheng are my sons. We're family.

516
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,080
You should be taking the initiative.

517
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,480
You should also be the one caring about him.

518
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,920
You're the elder brother, aren't you?

519
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,160
Don't you know Yunzheng's temper?

520
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,280
There's no way he'd tell Yuncheng when he's returning.

521
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
He even ignores your WeChat messages.

522
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,500
Wouldn't it be a waste of time for Yuncheng to get in touch with him?

523
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,560
Dad, Mom, I still have project proposals to go through.

524
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,100
I'll go upstairs first.

525
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,740
Go to bed early. Don't stay up too late.

526
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
You too.

527
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,560
 Wei'an, I've liked you for a long time.

528
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,090
 Can we be together?

529
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,840
 Be together!

530
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,980
 Be together!

531
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,740
 Be together!

532
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,144
 - Why did she leave? 
 - So awkward.

533
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,760

534
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:09,980

535
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,020
