 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,160
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,480
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,080

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,880
Be careful.

17
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,440
Slow down, Fang Mingfan. It's a mountain trail.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,460
Are you scared?

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,360
No, I'm not.

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,300
You insisted on coming.

21
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,565
What if something happens to us? How are we going to save them two?

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,640
With this speed...

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,320
Careful.

24
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,798
We'd be lucky to get there by daybreak.

25
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,680
What now? Their phones must be dead.

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,760
I just called them, but I couldn't get through.

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,340
This won't do.

28
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,460
Boss never gives up on me. I can never leave him alone.

29
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,690
What do you mean to give up on you? Why would he do that?

30
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,160
Didn't you ask me about my operative mortality?

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,520
I said that I had no record.

32
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,300
Actually, in my first operation,

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,180
my patient died on the operating table.

34
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,640
That night...

35
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,980
 The patient's vitals are unstable. Blood pressure 82, 48. Blood oxygen 70.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,600
 This is a blood blister-like aneurysm. The hemorrhagic spots must be taken care of now.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,340
 How long before Dr. He arrives?

38
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,835
 Dr. He is still having the runs. Director Zhang is in an operation now.

39
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:04,340
 Blood oxygen is lower than 60 now. Bleeding is over 1,000ml.

40
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,780
 We can't wait. Do the operation now.

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,160
 Dr. He only told you maintain the patient's vitals.

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,380
 If you do it now, you'll be responsible for the result.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,760
 Blood blister-like aneurysms are the most difficult and riskiest.

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,420
 Can you do it?

45
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,520
 If I don't try, he'll be dead for sure.

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,480
 The operation begins now. Gelatin sponge.

47
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,800
 The patient is in shock. He needs a transfusion now.

48
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,840
 The patient's having a cardiac arrest. Give him CPR now.

49
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,820

50
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,580
 Dr. He didn't show up. The patient was dying. What else can I do?

51
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,880
 Watch him die?

52
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,320
 You've only been an assistant before. You have never dealt with aneurysms. How can you act without permission?

53
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,860
 Thankfully, his family are sensible and won't hold you accountable. Go reflect on yourself properly.

54
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,300
 He can't even handle aneurysms, but he dared to act without the attending doctor.

55
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,519
 Who does he think he is?

56
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,800
 Dr. He said that some people aren't meant to be a surgeon.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,605
 I think no medical teams in our department will accept him.

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,000
 He can't even handle aneurysms, but he dared to act without the attending doctor.

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,340
 Who does he think he is?

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,540
 Dr. He said that some people aren't meant to be a surgeon.

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,360
 I think no medical teams in our department will accept him.

62
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,080
 You've only been an assistant before. You have never dealt with aneurysms. How can you act without permission?

63
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,300
 Thankfully, his family are sensible and won't hold you accountable.

64
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,360
 Go reflect on yourself properly.

65
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,740
 He can't even handle aneurysms, but he dared to act without the attending doctor.

66
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,720
 Who does he think he is?

67
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,740
 How did the patient die?

68
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,880
Everyone thought I was doomed, including myself.

69
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,080
Then Dr. Gu helped you?

70
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,703
You know why I keep calling him Boss?

71
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,980
He's only two levels higher than me.

72
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,920
But he's the opposite of me. He was famous after his first operation.

73
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,720
He performed a thalamic tumor operation at a very young age and became a legend of Huaren's Neurosurgery Department.

74
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,320
But I didn't expect that he would say to a loser who was forsaken by all

75
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,840
and about to change profession,

76
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,205
"If you don't mind,

77
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,840
I need a first assistant."

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,680
 Fang Mingfan?

79
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,100
 Why are you back?

80
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,320
 What?

81
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,100
 I said since you've decided to give up, why do you still come to the hospital?

82
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,000
 A habit, I guess.

83
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,840
 Could be an instinct, too.

84
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,320
 Fang Mingfan.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,940
 How much do you know about the transsphenoidal approach for pituitary tumors?

86
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,100
 I studied some videos and watched some doctors do it.

87
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,560
 If you don't mind, I need a first assistant.

88
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,600
 I can do itq.

89
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,440
Later, Boss came here for aid.

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,500
I didn't want to stay in China, where people commented about me. So I followed him.

91
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,320
So, Dr. Gu became your boss instead of your senior brother.

92
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,911
Then why did he favor you that much?

93
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:21,480
I asked him why he picked me. He didn't favor me.

94
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,580
He said he just didn't want to see a deserter.

95
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,560
He hated deserters.

96
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,250
And then? When did you have your second surgery?

97
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm not ready yet.

98
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,440
I know I'm useless.

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't say that.

100
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,120
You can't be as useless as me, anyway.

101
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,680
If you're not ready, take your time to get ready.

102
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,320
Life is long. There's always a second chance.

103
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,460
Yes, there is.

104
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,640
The free clinic is right ahead, I think.

105
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,700
Let's stay here and wait for them. Keep looking when there’s sunlight.

106
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,380
 Come on. Be careful.

107
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,440
Are you all right?

108
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
I'm fine.

109
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,780
Gu Yunzheng. Gu Yunzheng.

110
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,680
Gu Yunzheng, wake up.

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,020
You can't fall asleep.

112
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,400
Don't worry.

113
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,180
I didn't go into shock. I'm just too sleepy.

114
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,310
I served the medical mission all day and walked such a long way.

115
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,290
I'm really exhausted.

116
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,400
If you feel uncomfortable, you have to tell me.

117
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,620
Su Wei'an, to be honest, I quite enjoy being taken care of by you.

118
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,280
So, if I feel uncomfortable, I won't keep it from you.

119
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,940
Take some rest.

120
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,940
We can't walk like this. I'll go get helpers. You wait here for me.

121
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,260
Be careful, Su Wei'an!

122
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,320
Hurry up.

123
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,440
Let's go.

124
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,100
Where?

125
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,440
There.

126
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,300
Gu Yunzheng. Gu Yunzheng.

127
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,040
Gu Yunzheng. Wake up.

128
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,900
Gu Yunzheng.

129
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,260
You scared me.

130
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,360
You're so strong.

131
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,240
Are you okay?

132
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,780
I really didn't want to wake up.

133
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:02,820
If you woke me up two seconds later, I would had kiss you.

134
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,320
Look at this occasion. Don't involve me in this kind of dream.

135
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,580
What?

136
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,160
You are so controlling that you even want to control other people's dreams?

137
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,740
Wei'an!

138
00:12:24,335 --> 00:12:25,820
Hurry. Get him in.

139
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Boss, what happened?

140
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,560
- What happened? 
 - What's wrong?

141
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,680

142
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,820
You're awake.

143
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,160
How do you feel now?

144
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm thirsty.

145
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,160
Have some water. It stimulates the body's metabolism.

146
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,780
Hungry.

147
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,060
Here's some porridge. Want some?

148
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,260
I can't get up. Forget it, then.

149
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,200
Let me feed you.

150
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,740
- Here. 
 - Help me up.

151
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,620
Am I seeing this right?

152
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,660
Wei'an is feeding Dr. Gu.

153
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,400
That night, what did they do in Labe Village?

154
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,160
Wei'an is like a different person now. So is Dr. Gu.

155
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Did they eat some fruits in the village and get poisoned?

156
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,490

157
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,060
Morning, Sister Lan.

158
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,260
 What are you calling me for? I'll be late for the square dance.

159
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,440
Square dance?

160
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,920
But it's eight in the morning Beijing time, isn't it?

161
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Even wage slaves don't work until nine.

162
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,300
 Fine. I'll talk for a few minutes.

163
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,500
Wait. It's the weekend.

164
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,340
Why do you still stay in the hospital, taking classes, doing experiments,

165
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,840
 or reading in the library?

166
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,920
 You waste your time in France. You don't enjoy your life at all.

167
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,260
Who told you I only stayed in the hospital?

168
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,440
Last week, I volunteered for a medical mission in a village.

169
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,660
 I enjoyed the French countryside and experienced local customs.

170
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,900
What's the difference between seeing patients in a village and a hospital?

171
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,460
 Look. You're tanned again. Listen, a young girl must do skin care.

172
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:40,080
See? Sunscreen. It should be sprayed every two hours.

173
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,860
 You know what? Don't be stingy on this. Or you'll spend more on whitening injections.

174
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,560
All right, I get it.

175
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,060
I don't go there every day. Nor am I exposed to the sun.

176
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,800
 Then why are you tanned? Oh, no. You must have a metabolism problem because you're getting aged.

177
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,680
Metabolism?

178
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,500
I'm not even 30. What kind of mother talks like this?

179
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,360
 You're no match for me.

180
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,900
I have great genes. When we go out together,

181
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,760
 people say we're sisters, huh?

182
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,660
Who has such poor eyesight?

183
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,500
 Come on. What's your point?

184
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,200
Nothing. I just miss you.

185
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Last week, when I gave treatments,

186
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,980
I saw a little girl and her mother depending on each other to survive.

187
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,860
I suddenly missed you.

188
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,540
You had time to think of me? It means you're quite idle.

189
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,980
You don't even have a boyfriend, right?

190
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,540
Why can you lead every conversation to this?

191
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,260
Why didn't you ask if I was suffering out here?

192
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,500
If you're suffering, it's because you asked for it.

193
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,140
I didn't give you such a pretty face to face those lab instruments all day.

194
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,780
 Do you know what that's called? It's called wasting your valuable youth.

195
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,060
Stop, stop.

196
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,820
You win.

197
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm an open-minded mother.

198
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,440
I just want you to have a relationship.

199
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,320
A happy ending isn't that important. What matters is the process.

200
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,780
You won't keep waiting until you have a late-life love, huh?

201
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,460
I think it's you who wants a boyfriend.

202
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,720
Nonsense.

203
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,960
 Sister Lan, don't ever worry about that.

204
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,220
 I'm totally okay with it.

205
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,060
Don't be kidding. I'll hang up. I'll really be late.

206
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,580
Boss, our medical aid project will be over in two weeks.

207
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,000
Fill out the report sheets as soon as you can.

208
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,720
The hospital official asked whether we would apply for medical aid for the following year or go back to China.

209
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,640
Anything else?

210
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,640
The Medical Department asked me to remind you.

211
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,240
Before you came to Lakaya, your glioma project was suspended.

212
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,460
Since He Xiaoguang took it over, no progress has been made.

213
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,240
If things go on like this, it can't get the research fund for next year.

214
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,720
And the Youth Talent Program. It's held every four years.

215
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,320
If you don't return,

216
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,580
He Xiaoguang is very likely to have it.

217
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:34,154
So, are we or are we not going back?

218
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,630
Boss,

219
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,880
if we go back to China, what about you and Su Wei'an?

220
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,600
Have you confirmed your relationship?

221
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,942
If you return to China, will she go with you?

222
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,800
Did Jiang Muying send you?

223
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,580
I... I just think it's hard for you to keep pretending

224
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,940
your foot hasn't recovered. Right?

225
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,840
Hasn't recovered?

226
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,980
Watch this, then.

227
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,940
Just kidding.

228
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,360
Your foot hasn't recovered. Do not move.

229
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I'm fine

230
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,780
Does it still hurt?

231
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,600
Yes. It hurts a lot.

232
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
Wait.

233
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,300
These days, you could even perform surgery.

234
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,510
Why is it still so serious?

235
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,360
I can sit during the surgery. So, a foot injury doesn't interfere.

236
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,020
What are you laughing at?

237
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,760
Fang Mingfan, don't you have an emergency call?

238
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
What emergency...

239
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,120
Oh, yes. I have one.

240
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,360
I'll leave Boss to you.

241
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,320

242
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,360
You can perform surgery. So, you don't have a big problem. Rest for recuperation.

243
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
Wait.

244
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,500
Want to leave after taking my gown?

245
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,300
The lounge is too cold. So, I... I randomly took it.

246
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,460
Randomly?

247
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,340
I had an injured foot because of you. Are you going to leave me alone?

248
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,560
What do you want?

249
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,380
You must have learned this in college.

250
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,860
In human saliva, there's something called opiorphin.

251
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,180
Its analgesic effect is as good as morphine.

252
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,160
So, a kiss helps to ease the pain.

253
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,075
I never expected to see this. My cool boss was even rejected.

254
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,051
Do you have too much free time?

255
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:39,860
Do you want emergency calls for a week?

256
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,220
I'm sorry.

257
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,619
♫  Be honest in love  ♫

258
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,524
Don't sing so loudly in the hospital.

259
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:48,404
Shut up!

260
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,280

261
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,840

262
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,180
 Yuncheng, my father invited you over for dinner this weekend.

263
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,700
 What would you like to eat? I'll get the ingredients ready.

264
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,020
 Or shall we go grocery shopping together?

265
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,900
 I love to go grocery shopping with you.

266
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,540

267
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,100
- Come on in. 
 - President Du.

268
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,060
Have you booked my flight ticket to Lakaya?

269
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,400
Yes. But I have something to tell you.

270
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,320
Go ahead.

271
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,500
The clinical trial of Phase III of HDQ39 has started.

272
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,260
To increase the stock price, the board wants to hold a news conference,

273
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,560
and they hope you can attend it in person.

274
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,060
Then hold it after I'm back.

275
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,080
The recruitment will officially start next Monday. Will it be too late if we wait until...

276
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,480
Give it to me.

277
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,640
How much you commit to this project determines the attitude of the board.

278
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,860
If you attend the conference in person, the future fund application will go more smoothly.

279
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,060
Then cancel my flight ticket.

280
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,680
All right.

281
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,100

282
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,220
 But for Su Wei'an, he'll change his mind, I think.

283
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,180
 He's hesitating. I'll get more information for you.

284
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200

285
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
Don't stare at me.

286
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,320
Jiang Jiang.

287
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,780
Do you have skin-lightening products?

288
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,980
Why do you suddenly want that? Didn't you scorn me for doing skincare all day?

289
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,180
"A girl dolls herself up for him who loves her."

290
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,940
Su Wei'an.

291
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,540
What did you and Gu Yunzheng do in the wild over two days and one night?

292
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,980
Nothing.

293
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,480
That was a perfect chance. But you didn't get Gu Yunzheng.

294
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,280
You turned a love night into a wild adventure.

295
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,000
You just wasted the rainstorm God arranged for you.

296
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,900
Hey, what are you thinking every day?

297
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Why must we do something?

298
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I feel anxious for you, Wei'an.

299
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,420
If you don't hurry up, he'll go back to China.

300
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,660
Go back to China? Why?

301
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,040
Fang Mingfan said their medical aid project would be over soon, and they would return.

302
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,180
Gu Yunzheng didn't tell you?

303
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,620
I understand.

304
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,480
After all, you wasted that perfect chance in Labe Village.

305
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,180
I guess he thinks you have no feelings for him, so he doesn't dare to invite you back to China.

306
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,360
I really don't understand you.

307
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,180
He's such a great handsome man and you had such a big crush on him back then.

308
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,180
He's right in front of you, and you'll let him leave like that.

309
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,380
This is my ideal of life. Even if Mars crashed into Earth tomorrow and destroyed the world,

310
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,940
I would enjoy a remarkable love. Or my life would be wasted.

311
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,280
He's going back to China, but he said that to me.

312
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
What did he mean?

313
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,100
What? Have you decided? Where are we going?

314
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,240
Keep driving.

315
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,900
You aren't kidnapping me, are you?

316
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,720
Have you seen a kidnapper sit in the front passenger seat while the hostage drives?

317
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,040
You have a foot injury. Instead of staying in the hospital, you had to go out.

318
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,340
And made me drive you.

319
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,740
But you asked me to charter your car.

320
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,940
Don't you want to make money?

321
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,640
I do.

322
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,040
So, where are we going?

323
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
I learned about a local tribe

324
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,080
where there's a very famous witch doctor who takes care of incurable diseases.

325
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,520
I want to have him take a look at my foot.

326
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,900
Come on. You're an associate professor at Huaren.

327
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,280
Show a little respect for science, all right?

328
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,380
In terms of modern medicine, my foot injury should have recovered.

329
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,740
But now, it still hasn't.

330
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,080
I think some evil energy must have invaded my body.

331
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,780
It's already something that modern medicine can't explain.

332
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,400
I have to try something else.

333
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,780
Turn right at the end of the road.

334
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,120
Just so you know, you should pay double.

335
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
Fine. No problem.

336
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,540
♫  I'm loving you  ♫

337
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,340
Is this where the witch doctor lives?

338
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,940
Quite special.

339
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,400
Is he out for home consultations?

340
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,140
Look. The navigation led us here.

341
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,500
All right. I'll also get a witch doctor and open a branch here.

342
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,460
If someone is unable to be cured in Friendship Hospital, Dr. Gu can take them here and I'll make a big fortune.

343
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,820
Maybe this tree has spirituality.

344
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,420
You know what? My foot

345
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,260
doesn't feel as painful as before. Look.

346
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,740
Come. Let me take you somewhere.

347
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,440
Look.

348
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,300
This is beautiful.

349
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,720
This bridge was built by Chinese people.

350
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,020
I've been in Lakaya for over a year and crossed many bridges built by Chinese people.

351
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,260
I keep wondering if one of these bridges was built by my mother.

352
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,020
Some must be. Your mother is an honorable lady.

353
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,360
Yeah.

354
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,900
If she weren't my mother, maybe I would like her.

355
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,100
Let's say hi to it.

356
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,100
Hi!

357
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,660
Hi! How are you doing?

358
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,620
Can it be Nero Bridge?

359
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,040
I hear there's a day for Light Festival every year.

360
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,680
I've stayed in Lakaya for a long time, but I just haven't witnessed it.

361
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,660
Yeah.

362
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,520
You must have been busy making money.

363
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,940
You ran quite fast.

364
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,680
Your foot doesn't hurt, huh?

365
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,100
It does. It still hurts.

366
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,980
Want a try?

367
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,780
Are you all right?

368
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,460
Are you okay?

369
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,120
You know what?

370
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,880
Racing makes your brain release dopamine and get excited.

371
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,220
So does dating.

372
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,520
Looks like I can cure you better than that witch doctor.

373
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,040
Your foot has almost recovered, right?

374
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,980
Pay me.

375
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,740
What? The hostage asked the kidnapper for money?

376
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,340
You look more like a hostage.

377
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,620
I have no money. If you want me, you can get it.

378
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,980
What did you say? I can't hear you.

379
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,060
We're stopping here. Don't pretend.

380
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,460
You can't hear me?

381
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,010
Guess.

382
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,720
One more round.

383
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,620
Here we go!

384
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,780
We're in the middle of nowhere.

385
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,320
How did you get this?

386
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,880
When I was in the wild last time, I was so hungry and thirsty,
and it scared me.

387
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,760
So, I've prepared more for this time. Just in case.

388
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,620
All these things are necessities for outdoor living.

389
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,760
Is this also a necessity?

390
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,080
Don't underestimate this picnic blanket.

391
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,860
It resists moisture, water, and abrasion.

392
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,420
It is a perfect thing for home or travel.

393
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,340
Bro, we're in the desert. Resist moisture and water?

394
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,500
Just in case.

395
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,780
What about this?

396
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,220
Don't you remember when we were in the wild last time? Our phones ran out of battery.

397
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,090
Lamps with battery work better. Look.

398
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,160
See?

399
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:40,760
Are you saying we'll hang them on our body for lighting?

400
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,120
We can hang them somewhere high up. Look. Like this, for example.

401
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,770
They'll look great on the tent.

402
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,720
Tent?

403
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,800
You even brought a tent?

404
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,940
Wei'an, are you thirsty?

405
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,270
I saw you finished the water. Luckily...

406
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,340
What? Where's my water?

407
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,040
Who replaced it with alcohol?

408
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,180
Where's my water?

409
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,760
What?

410
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,580
 Wine makes cowards brave. Two cowards, this is all I can do for you.

411
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,560

412
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,320
Looks like

413
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,140
we only have some wine.

414
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
To quench our thirst.

415
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,240
Let's drink wine to quench our thirst.

416
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,700
Feels so good.

417
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:32,000
It's been a long time since I last enjoyed such a quiet night comfortably.

418
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,380
I don't need to think about anything.

419
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,360
I only need to quietly enjoy such a beautiful starry sky.

420
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,320
I feel the same.

421
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Every day before, I was as busy as a machine.

422
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,620
But I never stopped to think about why I keep myself so busy.

423
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh. After we drink, we can't drive back, huh?

424
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,520
Don't worry. When I'm around, you won't get hurt.

425
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,960
Why do I think you're the biggest danger?

426
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,940
What do you think I am?

427
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,200
However much I like you, I will not take advantage of you.

428
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,590
But I will.

429
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,340
What did you say?

430
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,960
Nothing.

431
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
Done.

432
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,400
Your culinary skills aren't bad.

433
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,010
Of course.

434
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,120
- Taste some. 
 - Smells so good.

435
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,120
Put it on.

436
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,360
No, thanks. I'm not cold. Wine keeps me warm.

437
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,820
Fine.

438
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,620
Taste some.

439
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:11,120
- How about we toast to the beautiful sky? 
 - Yes!

440
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,340
Cheers.

441
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,160
How about we compete?

442
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,760
The winner can ask the loser to do something.

443
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,580
Compete on what?

444
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,320
On finding the constellations. Who finds more will win.

445
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,020
What do you say?

446
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,180
In college, I was a member of the Astronomical Club. Are you sure you want to compete with me?

447
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,620
Are you really that awesome?

448
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,660
I once led a luxury tour in the desert. The tourists taught me.
I can say them in Chinese and French.

449
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,320
Is such baseless knowledge reliable?

450
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,790
Let's compete, and we'll know.

451
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,920
What? Or do you think losing to your student would disgrace you?

452
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,270
Student Su, you're so weirdly competitive.

453
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,640
Go. Let's get onto the roof of the car.

454
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,620
Orion!

455
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,120
See?

456
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:45,840
You know what?

457
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,420
Alpha Orionis is a bright orange star a thousand times bigger than the sun.

458
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,020
And Beta Orionis...

459
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,020
Ursa Major! Ursa Minor! 
  (TN: Big Dipper and Little Dipper)

460
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,220
Su Wei'an, you really want to compete?

461
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,540
What if you lose and cry?

462
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,140
If you still don't start, you're going to lose.

463
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,020
Okay.

464
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,320
Since you found Ursa Major and Minor, it would be easy to find...

465
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,040
- Draco. 
 - Cassiopeia!

466
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,220
Gemini. Auriga.

467
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,480
- Auriga? 
 -  Yup.

468
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,360
- You made it up, right? 
 - Why would I make it up?

469
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,860
A-U-R-I-G-A, Auriga.

470
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,200
Where is it? Show me.

471
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,260
There. Can you see the brightest star?

472
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,540
It's Capella. One of the major stars of Auriga.

473
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,080
It's all alone there.

474
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:57,420
Well, you're looking at a couple of stars.

475
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,520
They're a pair of binary stars.

476
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,720
They orbit each other around the same barycenter on very close trajectories.

477
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,680
So, they're not alone.

478
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,840
I said four constellations, while you said three. I won.

479
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,620
You didn't win. I'm not finished yet. We made a deal. The winner can...

480
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,660
♫  Forgotten conversations, every word filled with innocence  ♫

481
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,020
♫  My eyes fall on the lingering warmth of your palm  ♫

482
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,400
If you lose, you have to admit it.

483
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:51,580
♫  Occassionally my heart is racing fast, feeling unsettled from a nightmare  ♫

484
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,900
I'm willing to lose to you.

485
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,740
♫  ... on your hugs for comfort  ♫

486
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,120
♫  Your secret  ♫

487
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,060
♫  I was able to hear you sleep talk while you dream  ♫

488
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,140
♫  With a smile, I'm secretly writing down all your wishes  ♫

489
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,300
♫  With a smile, I'm secretly writing down all your wishes  ♫

490
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,980
♫  My secret  ♫

491
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,900
♫  I've forgotten that I was so alone  ♫

492
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:31,080
♫  I'm hoping in the future, you'd still be tugging on the corner of my sleeves  ♫

493
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,630
♫  I'm loving you  ♫

494
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,400
Are you awake?

495
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,240
Stop pretending. I saw that you are awake.

496
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,020
It's dawn.

497
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,820
Did you sleep well last night?

498
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:29,120
Not really. I'd like to sleep some more.

499
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:35,780
Which part wasn't good? I can do it again.

500
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,520
It's all good. You can get up now.

501
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,140
Wei'an, I really want to hold you like this every day.

502
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,640
The medical aid program is over, the hospital wants me to come back.

503
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:10,020

504
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,920
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

505
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,180
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

506
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,830
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

507
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:27,760
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

508
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,940
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

509
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,600
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

510
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,700
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

511
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:50,000
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

512
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,200
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

513
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,180
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

514
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,380
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

515
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,320
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

516
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:15,900
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

517
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,700
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

518
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,380
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

519
