 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,980

00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,320

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,980
Will you leave this escapist alone?

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,509
Dr. Li is too good to be true.

21
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,849
It would be a happy ending if you two got together.

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,260
Let go of me.

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,880
She may be a perfect girl, but I don't have or want any relationship with her.

24
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,660
She may be a perfect girl, but I don't have or want any relationship with her.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,300
I don't have any relationship with you either.

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,700
Why are you laughing?

27
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I've realized that I can now tell whether you're lying or not.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,600
Su Wei'an, the harsher your words now,

29
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,060
the more it shows how much you love me.

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,620
Your words convey the opposite of their meanings.

31
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,920
When you say you don't want to have any relationship with me,

32
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,580
you're actually saying that you love me.

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,005
But you're afraid to have a relationship with me.

34
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:31,050
Am I right?

35
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,730
Are you mentally ill?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In psychology, your condition is referred to as erotomania. 
  (T/N: Delusional belief that one is loved by someone else.)

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,980
Randomly fantasizing is a type of illness that needs to be treated.

38
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,560
Ask Dr. Li for help.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,100
Can I take your words to mean you don't want me to go to Dr. Li?

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,980
Can I take your words to mean you don't want me to go to Dr. Li?

41
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,485
Don't worry. I won't go to her.

42
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:58,520
But recently, Dr. Li has taught me how to be persistent and relentless.

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm a smart person, and I learned everything she said.

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
So, Su Wei'an, from now on, you can say harsh words as much as you want.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,500
So, Su Wei'an, from now on, you can say harsh words as much as you want.

46
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,700
But I won't believe a single word from you again.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,600
As for you... I'll never give up.

48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,220
So silly.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
I love you, too.

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
It hurts.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,640
Did you call me here today just to show me this?

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,060
Yuncheng, Su Wei'an undoubtedly carries the gene for chorea.

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,520
Yuncheng, Su Wei'an undoubtedly carries the gene for chorea.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,680
The report they have is a fake one.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,360
You have to believe me.

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Gu Yunzheng is defending her so much, can't you see?

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,880
His relationship with Su Wei'an isn't ordinary.

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,900
Don't let her deceive you.

59
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,280
You don't need to tell me what kind of person Su Wei'an is.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,460
You don't believe me?

61
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,640
At school, Su Wei'an was a scheming girl.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Now that she knows you're the CEO of Jiehui,

63
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,880
and that you've invested in HDQ39,

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,140
even if it's not for her aunt but for herself, she'll approach you and try to please you.

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,160
Do you think she really likes you?

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,880
If she truly liked you, she wouldn't have run away back then when you confessed.

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
If she truly liked you, she wouldn't have run away back then when you confessed.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,820
That's enough!

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't need you to interfere in my matters.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,380
Out of respect for Professor Wen, I won't argue with you this time.

71
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,280
But I don't want to see you causing trouble for Su Wei'an again.

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,460
But I don't want to see you causing trouble for Su Wei'an again.

73
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,800
Su Wei'an is using you. Aren't you angry at all?

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't you want to know why there are two versions of the report?

75
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,080
Don't you care at all whether she's really ill or not?

76
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,620
No.

77
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,460
Yuncheng,

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,480
your attitude today is very unusual.

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,640
You already knew she was sick, right?

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,400
As Gu Yunzheng said, your report is wrong.

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,300
As Gu Yunzheng said, your report is wrong.

82
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,760
Su Wei'an's genetic testing showed no problems.

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,280
She doesn't carry the chorea gene.

84
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,780
Then why did you resign back then?

85
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,400
Why did you insist on collaborating with my father to research chorea?

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,160
I'm just so curious, why do you insist on investing in such an obscure project?

87
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
It's obviously not profitable. Why?

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,740
Isn't it all for Su Wei'an?

89
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,260
Calm down.

90
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,040
You got together with me back then

91
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,097
just because you needed help from my dad.

92
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,780
 This is my senior, Du Yuncheng.

93
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,490
 Du Yuncheng.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,900
 Professor Wen, I've heard so much about you.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,660
 Yuncheng, let's skate hand in hand.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,960
 I'll support you. It'll be more stable that way.

97
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,760
 Yuncheng! Catch me, I can't stop!

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,060
 Thank you, Senior.

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,320
 Thank goodness you caught me.

100
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,560
 Otherwise, I would've fallen.

101
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,500
 Take the flowers.

102
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,400
 Senior, I like you.

103
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,440
 Will you be my boyfriend?

104
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,780
 Say yes!

105
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,480
 Hurry and pass me the flowers.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,900
 Say yes!

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
 I think you misunderstood.

108
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,020
 Say yes!

109
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,550
 What's wrong with him?

110
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,060
 This is embarrassing.

111
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,900
 Excuse me, is Professor Wen—

112
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,680
 Why are you looking for him?

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,020
 I want to give this to him.

114
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,680
 He's not here.

115
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,360

116
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,860
 Xiao Ran, please help me talk to him.

117
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,780
 We really want to invest in this project.

118
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,680
 But Senior, on what grounds should I speak up for you?

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,120
 But Senior, on what grounds should I speak up for you?

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,400
Even if it wasn't because of Su Wei'an, I would still break up with you.

121
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,050
Even if it wasn't because of Su Wei'an, I would still break up with you.

122
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,610
Wen Ran, did you ever really care about the real me?

123
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,940
If I'm not mistaken,

124
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,180
before you knew I was Du Yongsong's son, you never spoke a word to me!

125
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,700
Later on, you claimed to like me, and it became the talk of the entire hospital.

126
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,680
But after I resigned, you started neglecting me again.

127
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,400
If I didn't take over Jiehui, would you have actively pursued me?

128
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,800
Your love for me

129
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,100
is just like your love for a pretty piece of clothing or an expensive piece of jewelry.

130
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,080
It's just for filling the emptiness in your life.

131
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,960
We're not from the same world.

132
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,040
Du Yuncheng, if it weren't for me back then, my dad wouldn't have cooperated with you.

133
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,380
Just as I could help you back then, I can also destroy you right now.

134
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,870
If you have to break up with me, don't regret it.

135
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,320
Don't underestimate your father.

136
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,530
Professor Wen won't be swayed by your trivial matters

137
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,800
and act irresponsibly with his patients' lives.

138
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,400
You better behave yourself.

139
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,140

140
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,500
Hello, Senior.

141
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
 Wei'an, where are you?

142
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
 I have something to tell you.

143
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,120
I'll send you my location.

144
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,540

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,060
It's so late already, why don't you get in the car?

146
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,140
You won't find a taxi here.

147
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,640
I drove in this direction on purpose.

148
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,380
Why are you so shameless?

149
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,180
You've already said that.

150
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,340
It's really late. You don't want your mom to worry either, right?

151
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,200
Hurry up and get in.

152
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,960
That's enough, Su Wei'an.

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,020
Stop making a fuss. Get in the car.

154
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Wei'an, get in the car.

155
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,840
Wei'an, why are you in such a remote area?

156
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,020
Was that Gu Yunzheng just now?

157
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,140
Senior,

158
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm a bit tired today.

159
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,640
Then... should we go home?

160
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,100
Sure.

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,340
Thank you for sending me home.

162
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,220
I'll be off now.

163
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,940
Wei'an...

164
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,540
I broke up with Wen Ran.

165
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,500
So you wanted to see me to tell me this?

166
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,860
What I wanted to say was...

167
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm going to focus on my career now.

168
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,320
Would you like to join Jiehui and help me?

169
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,480
- Me? 
 - Yes.

170
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,380
Senior, Jiehui is such a big company.

171
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,680
If you hold an open recruitment, you'll definitely find someone better.

172
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,400
No one understands your character and abilities better than I do.

173
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
If you join Jiehui, it'll save me a lot of trial and error costs.

174
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,140
But I don't want to work in the pharmaceutical industry right now.

175
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,220
Thank you for your kindness.

176
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,640
Why?

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,300
Medical representatives are well-paid.

178
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,860
I still have to take care of my aunt.

179
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,640
Working at a bar is more flexible than working regular office hours.

180
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,500
I'll be off now.

181
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,780
 Is there anyone of the opposite gender here that you like?

182
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,540
 Yes.

183
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,220
 I'll sleep in the hospital for the next few days.

184
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,300
 You can go stay at my place.

185
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,780
 You should stay in the hotel. It'll be more comfortable at night.

186
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,300
 What are you doing here?

187
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,760
 I arranged a VIP room with the best lighting and facilities for Auntie.

188
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,540
 Assistant Lin is here to help with the transfer process.

189
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,220
 Go and get the transfer paperwork done now.

190
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,980

191
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,280

192
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280

193
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,660
Here you go.

194
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,320
Do you want to eat here or should I send it to the ward so you can eat with your aunt?

195
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,460
What are you trying to do?

196
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,280
It's just breakfast. I have no other intentions.

197
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,805
It's your favorite noodles with tomato and fried egg.

198
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:08,620
I was afraid it would get lumpy, so I made it dry-tossed.

199
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,480
Did I not make myself clear enough last time?

200
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,040
Dr. Gu, please stop showing me this kind of meaningless concern.

201
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,160
Is my concern for you meaningless?

202
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,920
Wei'an?

203
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,880
What are you guys doing?

204
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,540
Last time, you said you wanted to show me around your company.

205
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,520
Do you have time now?

206
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,920
You agree to work at Jiehui now?

207
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,980
Okay. Then let's go to the company right now.

208
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,020
We can discuss the work in detail there.

209
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,560
Okay.

210
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,820
Dr. Gu.

211
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm going to take Wei'an to the company now.

212
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,440
Boss?

213
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,600
Boss. What are you doing?

214
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,960
You brought me breakfast?

215
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Thank you, Boss. You've always treated me the best.

216
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,180
You knew I was on the night shift and brought me breakfast.

217
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,320
It smells so good! You're an impressive cook.

218
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Are you still our reserved and serious Boss?

219
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,000
Senior,

220
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,940
did I interrupt your plans?

221
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,220
Is there something else you came to the hospital for?

222
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,220
I wanted to visit your aunt. It's okay, I'll come back next time.

223
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,140
Don't take what I just said seriously, okay?

224
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm sorry, Senior. I just used you as a shield.

225
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,460
I actually just wanted to stop Gu Yunzheng from wasting his efforts again.

226
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,480
It's fine.

227
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,400
As long as you're willing, I'm ready to be your shield anytime.

228
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,080
Then... I'll go back and see Auntie now.

229
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,540
You're going back right now?

230
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,280
What if you run into Gu Yunzheng when you go back?

231
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,760
Wei'an, why have you been refusing to join my pharmaceutical company?

232
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,120
You have such a solid medical foundation.

233
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Even if you don't return to clinical practice, you shouldn't let it go to waste.

234
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,860
Even if you don't return to clinical practice, you shouldn't let it go to waste.

235
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,380
I just feel that I should let go of this profession completely.

236
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,700
But in Lakaya, didn't you work as a medical interpreter for Gu Yunzheng?

237
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,320
That was just a special case.

238
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,980
Fine.

239
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,840
But no matter what, go visit my company first.

240
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
Let's go.

241
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,620

242
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,560
Wei'an, this is the office area for our employees.

243
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,480
Hello, President Du.

244
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,160
We have at least 500 employees.

245
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,120
Anyway, here...

246
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,560
Who is that person?

247
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,400
President Du is even personally giving her a tour of the company.

248
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,360
Could she be a high-level executive recruited by a headhunter?

249
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,080
It doesn't seem like it, since she's so young.

250
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,020

251
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,180

252
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,260

253
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,860

254
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,620
President Du, we just heard that the Sino-French Neurosurgery Academic Exchange Conference will be held in Shengang soon.

255
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,100
Dr. Lu from the French National Center for Scientific Research will arrive in Jinhai this weekend.

256
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,780
He's planning to spend two days here.

257
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,400
I understand.

258
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,440
Senior,

259
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,460
is it Dr. Lu who researched the development of personalized brain mapping for precision navigation technology?

260
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,280
You know him?

261
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,940
I paid attention to his papers during my school days.

262
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,100
I heard that his latest research is more accurate and clearer than traditional brain mapping navigation technology.

263
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:49,160
It provides tumors with higher malignancy and more solid neural glia with more precise boundary identification.

264
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,230
It can greatly improve surgical accuracy.

265
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,180
You seem to have quite a thorough understanding.

266
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,980
Can you help persuade him to collaborate with us?

267
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,140
Me?

268
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,620
We've been discussing with Dr. Lu about introducing his latest technology of brain map navigation.

269
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,460
But Dr. Lu showed no interest in us. I didn't know what went wrong.

270
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,100
Since you're capable of French. Would you accompany me to receive him?

271
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,940
Of course, it's not an unpaid job.

272
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,460
I can pay you a high salary.

273
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,600
And if we make a deal with him, I'll also give you a commission.

274
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,100
I promise you'll be satisfied. What do you think?

275
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,080
Don't bring up money with me.

276
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,200
Since you've helped me so much, I'm finding a way to repay you.

277
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,760
This time, I'll provide you with pure help, and I will do my best.

278
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,000
Great.

279
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,980

280
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,020

281
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,040
Hello?

282
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,220
What?

283
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,260
Okay. Understood.

284
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,460
What's wrong, Yuncheng?

285
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,380
Dr. Lu's flight was rescheduled.

286
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,860
He arrived two hours early.

287
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,540
And he was picked up by Huaren's Dept. Neurosurgery.

288
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,720
Huaren's Dept. Neurosurgery?

289
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,660
Do they also want to introduce this patent?

290
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,700
Dr. Lu has a busy schedule here.

291
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,560
Huaren Hospital must aim at that by jumping the queue.

292
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,900
Go, let's intercept him at the hotel.

293
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,420
Understood.

294
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,940

295
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,480
Dr. Lu.

296
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,180
It's an honor to have you accept Professor Wang Huanzhong's invitation to pay a visit to Huaren Hospital.

297
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm here because Professor Wang is involved in a critical surgery.

298
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,220
He's occupied.

299
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,940
So he sent me to pick you up.

300
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,940
Now I'll take you to the hotel.

301
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,220
Professor Wang will invite you to a dinner tonight.

302
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,860
Dr. Gu. This old gentleman doesn't understand Chinese, does he?

303
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,140
He just ignored you all the way.

304
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,560
Should we find a French interpreter?

305
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,040
Our interpreter is ready.

306
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,520
- Dr. Gu, I'll be waiting for you in the parking lot. 
 - Okay.

307
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,600
I heard Huaren's staff picked up Dr. Lu. I didn't expect it to be you.

308
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,460
We arranged our pickup with Dr. Lu a month in advance.

309
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,520
I didn't expect that there would be a line-cutter.

310
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,500
It's about having good relations, not about who was first in line.

311
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,040
Our Director Wang is Dr. Lu's old friend.

312
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,200
He's more aware of the schedule changes.

313
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,700
I'll talk to Dr. Lu now.

314
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,600
Su Wei'an.

315
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:33,652
Hello.

316
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,940
Mr. Du, you seem so determined.

317
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,000
You even brought a French interpreter.

318
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,960
Wei'an is not only my interpreter but also my close partner.

319
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,800
Close partner?

320
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,280
Does your girlfriend know that?

321
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,040
I've ended things with Wen Ran.

322
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,000
The one I like is Wei'an. I'm pursuing her.

323
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,980
Are you aware of her past with me in Lacaya?

324
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,800
Has Su Wei'an ever replied to your wishful pursuit?

325
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,320
I don't care about the story between you in Lacaya.

326
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,520
It's in the past. It won't affect my affection for her.

327
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,460
You should understand

328
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,980
it's all over.

329
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,000
Stop sticking to her.

330
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,620
Dr. Lu, we are from Jiehui Medicines Company.

331
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,740
We've been in touch before.

332
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,200
Jiehui? Is this the company that wants to buy my patent?

333
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,780
Jiehui? Is this the company that wants to buy my patent?

334
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,880
Oh, you're capable of Chinese. That's great.

335
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,420
- Our company hopes... 
 - I won't sell it.

336
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,360
Dr. Lu, Mr. Du has prepared a dinner party for you.

337
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,800
- We can discuss it at the table. 
 - I'm not hungry.

338
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,860
This is my private time. Don't discuss work with me now.

339
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,470
Let me help you with the luggage.

340
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,140
This way.

341
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,330
Have some water.

342
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,140
Thank you, Senior.

343
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,100
Dr. Lu, have some water.

344
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,240
That way.

345
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,380
Dr. Lu, please don't leave yet.

346
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,640
I know you are fluent in Chinese.

347
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,540
But during your home trip this time, a considerate and reliable guide will enhance your experience.

348
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,760
What do you think if I serve as your tour guide?

349
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,460
Why should I let you be my tour guide?

350
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,200
Because I'm very familiar with Jinhai City.

351
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,460
I know the places to eat, drink, and have fun.

352
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,260
Take this store for example.

353
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,880
Guests here usually choose dishes like Spicy Sichuan Skewers, Spicy Tofu Pudding, or Wonton in Chili Oil...

354
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,840
But in this store, the best dish is Deep-fried Sticky Rice Balls.

355
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,460
They have a perfect ratio of brown sugar to oil.

356
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,940
The dish is really soft and sweet.

357
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
That's it.

358
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,900
I don't want a lengthy introduction about the company.

359
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,940
I know.

360
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,420
I'll be your tour guide from now on.

361
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,760
I won't mention the company unless you ask about it.

362
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,460
I won't pay you a guide fee.

363
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,360
It doesn't matter.

364
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,120
You see, my boss is here. He will pay the bills.

365
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,340
I can enjoy the tour for your sake at the company's expense, right?

366
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,680
I can afford my expenses.

367
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,020
It's not about the money.

368
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,360
If he's here, we'll be able to savor a few more dishes and not waste them.

369
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
Otherwise, the two of us will waste food if we buy more and experience less fun if we buy less.

370
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,900
Right?

371
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,860
You make a point.

372
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,040
You can also help us with the dishes.

373
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,320
But I must be clear.

374
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,940
This is my private time.

375
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,140
Don't discuss work with me.

376
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,940
Otherwise,

377
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,100
I might get angry.

378
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,560
Since you are familiar with the food here,

379
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,760
please order for us.

380
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
No problem.

381
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Excuse me.

382
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,698
Let's move on, Miss Su.

383
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:52,258
I've already figured out where we're going next.

384
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,860
Dr. Lu, don't you need a rest?

385
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,640
You've just returned from France.

386
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,400
Do you need jet lag?

387
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Although I'm quite energetic, I'll be exhausted after another 3-hour walk.

388
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,460
But we'll be late there.

389
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,220
We won't. The place offers free entry.

390
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,780
Even if it's as late as midnight, I'll accompany you there.

391
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,800
Let's take a break first.

392
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,320
Have a seat, Dr. Lu.

393
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,540
Hello, Professor.

394
00:33:50,556 --> 00:33:54,161
Dr. Lu is really a tough nut to crack.

395
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:59,400
Since we picked him up, he has been making things difficult for us. And...

396
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,745
he refuses to talk about work affairs.

397
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:04,660
 Dr. Lu is indeed a stubborn guy.

398
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,706
 Just continue to spend time with him.

399
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:09,806
 Faith will move a mountain.

400
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,820
Understood.

401
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,820
Xiao Ran. It's been a long time. I've missed you.

402
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,460
Why haven't you come to see me?

403
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,000
Auntie,

404
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,800
help me give this toy bear back to Yuncheng.

405
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,500
It's a token of our love.

406
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,840
But it's not appropriate for me to keep it anymore.

407
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,645
What's happened between you two?

408
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,610
Has Yun Cheng bullied you again?

409
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,975
Yuncheng...

410
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:12,800
he won't answer my calls or reply to my messages.

411
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,765
Why?

412
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,700
Yuncheng...

413
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:24,756
has shifted his love to another girl.

414
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,040
Who?

415
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,940
Her name is Su Wei'an.

416
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,940
She's our classmate in college.

417
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,940
Back then,

418
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,040
Yuncheng had a secret crush on her.

419
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,840
And now, he has even brought her into his company.

420
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,040
And now, he has even brought her into his company.

421
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,200
How could Du Yuncheng be so foolish?

422
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,150
Auntie.

423
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,220
Please don't blame Yun Cheng.

424
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,300
During our schooldays, Wei'an and I used to be friends.

425
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,320
But she ended up stealing my academic work

426
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,360
and was expelled from the university.

427
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:20,100
I think this time, she means to get back at me.

428
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,040
And it's causing trouble for Yuncheng.

429
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,360
Don't worry.

430
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,160
I promised you that you'll be Yuncheng's only wife.

431
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
No one else can take your place.

432
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,400
That girl won't get near the company or Yuncheng that easily.

433
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,880
Yuncheng is my first love.

434
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,340
I... I can't let him go.

435
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,080
Don't worry, I'll handle this situation.

436
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,920
You'll be satisfied with the outcome.

437
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,920
What on earth does Dr. Lu want?

438
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,220
He just refuses to talk about his patent.

439
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,920
What conditions is he dissatisfied with?

440
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,900
The price?

441
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,080
Or the exclusivity clause?

442
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,040
We can't go on like this with him.

443
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,720
I'm getting a call.

444
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,060
Mom.

445
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,820
 Yuncheng, I suddenly felt sick in my heart while I was shopping.

446
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,500
Can you come and pick me up?

447
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,700
Yuncheng, over here!

448
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,840
Mom, what's the matter with you?

449
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
I'm fine.

450
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,860
I called you here to enjoy a meal with me and Xiao Ran.

451
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,800
You might have made an excuse and refused it.

452
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,900
I'm busy with accompanying Dr. Lu from France. I'm not free.

453
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,700
I'll leave now if you're all right.

454
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,300
Wait.

455
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,400
I think someone enchants you.

456
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,920
Your dad may blame you.

457
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,700
It's enough.

458
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,060
I know you two are bickering.

459
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,680
Just have a meal with us.

460
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,400
You two can watch a movie and talk things over.

461
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,100
Don't bring misunderstandings between you two for an insignificant person.

462
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:05,080
You know, your dad and grandpa are satisfied with Xiao Ran.

463
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,800
Auntie, I will forgive Yuncheng.

464
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,600
Yuncheng was just joking with me, didn't you?

465
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,600
I know you've been upset.

466
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,120
What's stopping him from selling his patent?

467
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,570

468
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,820
I see!

469
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
What are you reading?

470
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,860
It's a trade secret. Stop peeping.

471
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,400
What trade secret?

472
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,060
It's just your chat with Du Yuncheng.

473
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm not interested in it at all.

474
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
Then don't ask about it.

475
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,140
Does it matter to you whom I chat with?

476
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,920
Girl, are you still not giving up?

477
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,280
I've made my attitude clear.

478
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,600
My patent won't be sold at any price.

479
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Dr. Lu, we agreed not to discuss work.

480
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,940
I'm just your tour guide now.

481
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,500
There's another landmark in Jinhai City that you haven't visited yet.

482
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,060
If you miss it, your trip won't feel perfect.

483
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,940
Where is it?

484
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,640
Come with me.

485
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,480
It's a trade secret. You're not allowed to follow.

486
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,960
I've invited him to follow.

487
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,960
If the next place you take me can't impress me,

488
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,400
I might sell my patent to him.

489
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Hear that?

490
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,840

491
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,340
Here, Dr. Lu.

492
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,720
Take a seat here.

493
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Is this what you said to be a landmark of Jinhai City?

494
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
What do you know?

495
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,380
Dr. Lu, The Heaven Band in One Way Bar is very famous in Jinhai City.

496
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,480
I'll be playing for you tonight.

497
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,920
I promise to keep playing until you're satisfied.

498
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,580
Great. I'm expecting your performance tonight.

499
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,240
Okay.

500
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,600
You really go all out to help Du Yuncheng.

501
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,040
Just leave if you don't like it.

502
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,460
All right.

503
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,600
Let's roll.

504
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
Do you love her?

505
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,940
I...

506
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,740
These past few days, you claim to be receiving me on behalf of your mentor.

507
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,980
But actually, your mind was all on her.

508
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,100
And that President Du of Jiehui,

509
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,660
he's the same.

510
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,080
Both of you have hidden intentions.

511
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:10,050

512
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,040
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

513
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,200
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

514
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,880
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

515
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,200
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

516
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,960
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

517
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,620
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

518
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,800
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

519
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,080
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

520
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:57,220
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

521
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,300
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

522
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,400
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

523
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,440
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

524
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:15,620
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

525
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,820
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫
