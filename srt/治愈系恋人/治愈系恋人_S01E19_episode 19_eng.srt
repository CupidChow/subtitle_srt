 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,360
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,540
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,360
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,960
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,220

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  May you find her admist the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,180

00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,980

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,980

16
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,920

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,880
Dr. Li, are you done eating?

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,940
If you are, I'll pay the bill now.

19
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,500
I already understand the framework and standard procedures.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
If there's anything else, we can discuss it over email.

21
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,620
I’m heading out now.

22
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,660
Her body language shows that she likes you.

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,700
But at the same time, she's rejecting you.

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,260
Since she already rejected you, why don't you consider someone else?

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,520
Li Wantong, this is my final warning.

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,580
I've already had a meal with you.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,800
If there are any other work matters, please communicate via email.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,780
Personally, I will not accept your pursuit.

29
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,300
Dr. Gu, it's my right to pursue you.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,300
You can reject me, but I'll still pursue you.

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,020
Boss, the bill, please.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,480
I'll come find you again!

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,900
 How exactly do you see everything that happened between us?

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,460
 We went through so much in Lakaya.

35
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,965
 Does simply saying it's over make it over?

36
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:04,440
 Can you just end it without giving me an explanation?

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,320
 The dream is over.

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,300
 So the story should end too.

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,740
 Su Wei'an, is leaving you really a better choice for you?

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,660
 Su Wei'an, is leaving you really a better choice for you?

41
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,980
Su Wei'an.

42
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,200
You finally got your wish.

43
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,640
It's all over now.

44
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,860
 Come to the hospital tomorrow, and remember to bring something delicious.

45
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
 Come to the hospital tomorrow, and remember to bring something delicious.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,160
Dr. Lu!

47
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
Are you eating random food again?

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,420
What are you eating?

49
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,540
Didn't they tell you not to eat spicy food?

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,460
What delicious food did you bring me?

51
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,560
Rice porridge. That's all you can eat right now.

52
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,060
Just hearing about it makes me lose my appetite.

53
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,460
You're not sincere.

54
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,860
This document...

55
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,040
I'll just keep it to myself.

56
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,700
You agreed?

57
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,530

58
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,380
The transfer fee is just one RMB?

59
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,020
Don't get too happy too soon.

60
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,660
My contract terms are very clear.

61
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,220
Unless you can resolve the incomplete brainstem fibers issue,

62
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,260
you are not allowed to apply this patent to clinical use.

63
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,220
To fix this issue,

64
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,100
you'll have to invest a significant amount of money and time in the future.

65
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,180
you'll have to invest a significant amount of money and time in the future.

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,500
Anyway, I won't be around to see it.

67
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,380
So you guys have to figure it out yourselves.

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,900
Please don't worry.

69
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,780
Jiehui will definitely do its best.

70
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,960
We'll definitely work hard to not let your lifelong research go to waste.

71
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,560
You have to keep your word.

72
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,260
Of course.

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
Come here, young lady.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Let's take a photo together.

75
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,120
You, young lady, are quite likable.

76
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,180
Come on.

77
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,400
Three, two, one.

78
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,580
Let's take a look.

79
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,220
Come on, why are you crying?

80
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,700
I've lived a pretty good life.

81
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,560
My biggest regret is that the research project wasn't completed.

82
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,180
My biggest regret is that the research project wasn't completed.

83
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,660
But when I returned to China this time,

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,600
I found a good home for it.

85
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,980
And you took me to so many places and helped me take so many photos.

86
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,300
And you took me to so many places and helped me take so many photos.

87
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,500
My final memories are all beautiful ones.

88
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,220
In my final days,

89
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,940
I have no concerns.

90
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Young lady,

91
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
thank you.

92
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,340
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

93
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,840
Stop crying. Come here. Let's take another one.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,980

95
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,680
Thanks.

96
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,220
Hi!

97
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,380
How come it's you again?

98
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,220
You even followed me to Shengang for a conference?

99
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm also here to study, as well as look for opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.

100
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm also here to study, as well as look for opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration.

101
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,300
How did you know I'm staying at this hotel?

102
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
I didn't know. The hospital booked this hotel for everyone.

103
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,040
I just reminded them that they might get a discount if they booked several rooms together.

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,520
I just reminded them that they might get a discount if they booked several rooms together.

105
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,460
All of this just means that we're destined for each other,

106
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,480
and that we share common interests and career paths.

107
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,060
So, Dr. Gu, don't you think we should try to develop this further?

108
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,300
Get rid of the "we."

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,440
There has never been a "we" between you and me.

110
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,900
This is my menstrual cycle chart.

111
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,580
If you're unable to fall in love with me and marry me in a short period of time,

112
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,900
and then naturally have a child, that's okay.

113
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,900
We can skip over these formalities,

114
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,500
and directly create a child with excellent genes.

115
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
"Create a child?"

116
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,340
True, people typically may not be able to accept this idea.

117
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,120
But Dr. Gu, you and I are both doctors.

118
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,340
In our hearts, we all understand that all species are the same.

119
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,240
Only excellent genes can be passed down.

120
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,300
As for love, it's just a fig leaf humans invented for the sake of reproducing offspring.  (T/N: A cover-up)

121
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,320
As for love, it's just a fig leaf humans invented for the sake of reproducing offspring.  (T/N: A cover-up)

122
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,760
So you think humans and animals are no different?

123
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,240
And that mating and reproduction are all instinctive, right?

124
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Of course not.

125
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,740
Animal instincts are random, but you are the target I carefully selected.

126
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,690
Animal instincts are random, but you are the target I carefully selected.

127
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,360
What's the point of reproducing without emotion and love?

128
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,220
How can you say there's no love?

129
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,580
I have love.

130
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,920
You see, some people love money, and some people love lust.

131
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,340
And I really love your genes.

132
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,460
So, our two excellent genes should be combined.

133
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,780
Otherwise, it would be a crime against human evolution.

134
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,940
Li Wantong, I can't stand hearing another word from you.

135
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,020
Li Wantong, I can't stand hearing another word from you.

136
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,540
Let me tell you one more time.

137
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,940
There's no chance between you and me.

138
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm done eating. Goodbye.

139
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,260
The bill for Table No. 3, please.

140
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,460
Eliot, what are you doing here?

141
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,580
I'm here for the conference.

142
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,500
Where's Su Wei'an?

143
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,781
She...

144
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,840
Our study shows that the activation of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,420
Our study shows that the activation of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway

146
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,520
drives a subset of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma to exit the stem cell state,

147
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,129
promotes cell differentiation, as well as induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

148
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:55,269
promotes cell differentiation, as well as induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

149
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,020
Now, let's take a look at several sets of comparative images.

150
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,440
Such perfect genes.

151
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,620
What a waste.

152
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,580
Do you know him?

153
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,660
Who are you?

154
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm Eliot from the Neurosurgery Department at Sacre Coeur Hospital of Paris VI University.

155
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,620
In the heat map of gene expression...

156
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm Li Wantong from the Psychiatry Department at Huaren Hospital.

157
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,580
at a specified time point,

158
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,440
show contrasting gene expression patterns compared to the other heat map.

159
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,300
If you look here, you can tell the difference between them.

160
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,600
Eliot.

161
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,090
Long time no see, Dr. Gu.

162
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,060
Your speech was excellent.

163
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,160
It seems like I'll be having frequent academic discussions with you in the future.

164
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,720
Dr. Eliot, you are welcome to visit Jinhai and Huaren Hospital anytime to discuss ideas.

165
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,020
Dr. Gu, Lakaya really leaves a deep impression.

166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,880
Do you miss our days there?

167
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,680
It really is unforgettable.

168
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,460
I almost accompanied the General to his grave.

169
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,700
And you almost kidnapped Su Wei'an to France.

170
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,990
That was a beautiful misunderstanding.

171
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,140
She just wanted to go to Paris to learn about a new medical research project.

172
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,260
What research project?

173
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,860
Huntington's disease?

174
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,920
So she told you about it.

175
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,640
Are you two together now?

176
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,160
As soon as Su Wei'an heard me mention Dr. Marta restarting the chorea project,

177
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,400
she didn't hesitate and wanted to go to Paris.

178
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,920
But the experiments failed.

179
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,960
I lied to her.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,560
She was devastated.

181
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,180
She said it didn't matter where she was if there was no cure.

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,960
Gu, luckily, she has you.

183
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,100
 Where's Eliot?

184
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,940
 Why did he leave you here alone?

185
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,840
 What happened?

186
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,280
 I suddenly don't want to go anymore.

187
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,540
 I want to live too.

188
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,660
 At that time, she still didn't know about her aunt's illness.

189
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,200
 Who was she researching new treatment methods for then?

190
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,360
 Su Wei'an, was it for yourself?

191
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,980
Sorry, I need to make a phone call.

192
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,560
Please help me book the soonest flight to Jinhai.

193
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,300
Thanks.

194
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,400

195
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,120

196
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,783
Auntie. Auntie!

197
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,623
Ah Yuan.

198
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,380

199
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,740
Doctor.

200
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,660
The patient had surgery for a ruptured aneurysm at Huaren two weeks ago. She was discharged five days ago.

201
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,200
She's now in a deep coma with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of four. There may be new bleeding.

202
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,680
Neck stiffness, four fingers across. Do a head CT scan immediately.

203
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,880
Prepare an operating room. Contact Dr. He Xiaoguang right away.

204
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,500
Understood.

205
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,380
Contact who?

206
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,500
The attending doctor on duty today is Dr. He Xiaoguang.

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,240
He'll be the lead surgeon for this operation.

208
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,860

209
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,460

210
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,720
Gu Yunzheng.

211
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,210

212
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,880

213
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,420
 It's done.

214
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,380
 Handsome?

215
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,200
 Su Wei'an, why didn't you get his contact information for when he's in China?

216
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,740

217
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:45,957
 Hello?

218
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,140
Hello, Gu Yunzheng.

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
This is Su Wei'an.

220
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Right now, my aunt... is in the operating room at Huaren Hospital.

221
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,160
Her aneurysm ruptured again.

222
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,840
But the surgeon tonight is He Xiaoguang. I'm afraid my aunt won't make it out.

223
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,520
 Don't worry, I'm here.

224
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,980
 It's okay, I'll be right there.

225
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,760

226
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,260
♫  That sweetness from the past  ♫

227
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,420
Wei'an, I'm here.

228
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:58,960
♫  It's as if fate is playing a game with me  ♫

229
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,560
♫  I still think of it from time to time  ♫

230
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,260
♫  It's hard to explain what I'm feeling  ♫

231
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,520
♫  Perhaps I understand it too well  ♫

232
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:18,800
♫  I don't want to be forgotten after being loved  ♫

233
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,340
♫  It's okay if you forget  ♫

234
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,120
♫  You were the one to give me courage  ♫

235
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,720
♫  I will always bless you for the scenery that I will never be able to wait for  ♫

236
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,540
♫  I will always bless you for the scenery that I will never be able to wait for  ♫

237
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,220
♫  Even if you forget, it doesn't matter  ♫

238
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,160
♫  It's my way of saving myself  ♫

239
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,700
♫  I will always love you  ♫

240
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,020
♫  and never given up  ♫

241
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,680
Mom, we can't give HDQ39 to Auntie anymore.

242
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Why?

243
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,240
Auntie's second aneurysm rupture...

244
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:11,055
was very likely caused by this drug.

245
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,780
How do you know that?

246
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,740
Dr. Gu reminded me before.

247
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,780
But at that time,

248
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,680
I thought that if it was just speculation, we shouldn't stop the medication arbitrarily.

249
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,740
If I hadn't told Auntie about the drug trial, and if I hadn't strongly recommended that she try the drug,

250
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,420
she wouldn't have had two ruptured aneurysms in such a short time and she wouldn't be fighting for her life in there right now.

251
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,480
It's all my fault that Auntie is like this now.

252
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,500
Silly girl,

253
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,000
when she tried the drug, it was a decision we all discussed together, right?

254
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,080
It was my wishful thinking. I thought I could help Auntie.

255
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,740
But instead, I got her into trouble.

256
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,420
No, you did all this for her sake.

257
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,760
How could you have known that these things would happen, right?

258
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,180
Stop thinking about it. You can't blame yourself for this.

259
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,200
All right, let's not think about it anymore.

260
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,940
Okay?

261
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,590

262
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,380
Just pay attention to her diet and daily routines.

263
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,100
And this patient likes to eat spicy food, so advise her to avoid it.

264
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,180
Okay.

265
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,660
There's nothing else, so you can go now.

266
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,480
You must be exhausted these days.

267
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,140
I'm fine.

268
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,180
Seeing you like this,

269
00:20:07,043 --> 00:20:10,480
you must've been through a lot of worries and fears, running around here and there.

270
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,380
I'm okay. It's just that my aunt suffered a lot.

271
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
How is she doing now?

272
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,260
She's much better.

273
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,780
She's been transferred to another ward for further observation.

274
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,480
That's good.

275
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,780
You...

276
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,960
Why did you keep the phone number you used in Lakaya?

277
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm afraid the doctors in Lakaya will need remote assistance.

278
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm just kidding, silly.

279
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,840
I'm afraid you won't be able to find me.

280
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,420
Actually, for these past few days...

281
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,180
I've been looking for a chance to apologize to you.

282
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,740
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,780
I think your suspicions about HDQ39 might be correct.

284
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,280
If I had listened to you back then, even if it was just suspicions,

285
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,540
and asked my aunt to temporarily stop the medication, maybe we wouldn't be in this situation now.

286
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,560
Right, I... can I ask you for a favor?

287
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,520
Can you help me find out

288
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,020
if HDQ39 really cause aneurysms?

289
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,700
Su Wei'an,

290
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,960
why don't you look into it yourself?

291
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,620
I...

292
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,220
You also studied medicine.

293
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,480
What I can do, you can do as well.

294
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm just an undergraduate. I can't.

295
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,540
You haven't even tried. How do you know you can't?

296
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,240
Professor Lu also said that you have outstanding medical talents and gifts.

297
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400
Why do you want to waste them?

298
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,780
I really can't do it.

299
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,420
You're more likely to uncover the truth than I am. You're Gu Yunzheng.

300
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,460
But I'm not you.

301
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,420
Su Wei'an, only you can resolve your inner obstacles.

302
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,120
I don't have time. I still need to take care of my mom and my aunt.

303
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,860
I still need to make money. I still have a lot to do.

304
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,800
No. Su Wei'an,

305
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,560
you're afraid.

306
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Back in Lakaya, didn't you already try recklessly

307
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,040
to follow Eliot to France to participate in medical research experiments?

308
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,740
- How did you know? 
 - Why did you dare to do it back then, but not now?

309
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,240
Because...

310
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
Because I was stubborn and already got my aunt into trouble.

311
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,460
Even if there's only the slightest chance, we should still try our best.

312
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,620
This is the instinct of every medical student.

313
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,860
Su Wei'an, you're not doing this for yourself.

314
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,680
Participating in the drug trial wasn't just for my aunt's illness.

315
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,560
Because I also carry the chorea gene.

316
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,900
So, I particularly hope that HDQ39 can be put on the market.

317
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm not trustworthy at all, and I don't deserve to participate in medical research.

318
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,140
Su Wei'an, you're right.

319
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,060
You're extremely selfish and despicable.

320
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,100
You knew that participating in the drug trial could potentially lead to a serious aneurysm rupture,

321
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,620
but you still treated your aunt like a guinea pig and forced her to participate.

322
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,425
Is that right?

323
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,850
Since you didn't do that,

324
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,550
what exactly did you do wrong that you are tormenting yourself like this?

325
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,040
If it's not my fault, then whose fault is it?

326
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,520
Every time I have the tiniest bit of hope,

327
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,570
all I end up with is despair.

328
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,620
Why does misfortune have to befall me?

329
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:08,800
Why did such a rare and unlikely disease strike my family with such precision, like a bolt of lightning?

330
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,280
Why must there be cursed people like us in this world?

331
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,465
Hello, Wei'an.

332
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:46,090
 Senior, I've decided not to go to Jiehui.

333
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,595
Why? Is it because of the salary?

334
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:51,240
 Regarding my aunt's aneurysm rupture this time,

335
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,880
I think Gu Yunzheng's speculations might be right.

336
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,470
 It's very likely related to HDQ39.

337
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,638
 As a patient's family member,

338
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:02,623
I shouldn't have any more conflicts of interest with Jiehui.

339
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:04,320
It doesn't comply with regulations.

340
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,940
 Also, I'd like to ask for your help in confirming whether the drug trial team

341
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:13,800
 has reported the relevant situation to the Drug Trial Supervisory Department and the Ethics Committee.

342
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,940
 They can decide if the drug trial needs to be suspended.

343
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:22,780
And can the trial team also conduct some studies to clarify whether HDQ39 is related to the formation of aneurysms?

344
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,885
I understand.

345
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,145
I respect your decision.

346
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,925
If there's anything else you need help with later on, just let me know.

347
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,090
 Thank you, Senior.

348
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,500

349
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,580
 Dr. Gu, I have a new target now, so I won't pester you anymore.

350
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,670
 However, the collaboration between our two departments will continue.

351
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,520
 I can see that your love has put a lot of pressure on Su Wei'an,

352
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,860
 so here's a friendly tip.

353
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,640
 Doting on your partner in every way and giving your all may not necessarily be appreciated.

354
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,900
 When you stop being so pushy and act indifferent towards her instead,

355
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,160
 she'll be the one chasing you. In psychology, this is called the Veblen effect.

356
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,180
 Good luck!

357
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,120
 Wei'an,

358
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,860
 if you refuse to get close to me, then I'll just fly around you.

359
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,880
Jiang Muying. Regarding Su Wei'an's situation, I know everything you know.

360
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,940
I love her, no matter the circumstances.

361
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:18,660
From the moment I fell for her, I never thought about giving up.

362
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,940
So, as long as Su Wei'an does love me,

363
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,840
and as long as you really want what's best for her, just do as I say.

Professor Wang. Hello, this is Su Wei'an.

372
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,660
Well... please send me the schedule for the French conversation classes.

373
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,920
It's fine to schedule more classes.

374
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,180
The price is as we agreed before, 400 RMB per class, right? 
  (56.35 USD)

375
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,540
Okay, thank you.

376
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,840
Stop.

377
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,160
Why aren't you going to the interview for that French translator job I recommended?

378
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,320
100,000 RMB a month? How can there be such a good thing? 
  (14,088 USD)

379
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,580
There must be a scam.

380
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,560
Is the recruiter male or female?

381
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,360
Male.

382
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,260
What's wrong with a male?

383
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,420
You... You're being sexist. You only translate for women?

384
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,440
There's no free lunch.

385
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,920
- Where are you going? 
 - Restroom.

386
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,660
Hello, Dr. Gu.

387
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,100
Wei'an... she absolutely refuses to believe that it's true.

388
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,360
It seems like your idea isn't working.

389
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,620
Is that really a good idea?

390
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,860
Okay. Okay, sure.

391
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,880
I'll tell you the truth.

392
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,890
This job comes with conditions.

393
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,040
See? What did I tell you?

394
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,280
Come on, did you really think I'd sell you out?

395
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,880
This is a serious translation job. It's going to be published in The Lancet.

396
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,620
The Lancet?

397
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,800
But that doesn't make sense.

398
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,300
If it can already be published in such an authoritative journal, why would they need to find another translator?

399
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,960
Because there are tight deadlines, a heavy workload, and high demands.

400
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,160
The content of this job is strictly confidential.

401
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,480
Plus, they have to interview candidates first before hiring. That's why the pay is so high.

402
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,800
I think making money is one aspect,

403
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,740
but the most important thing is the opportunity to translate articles at this level.

404
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,900
- When's the interview? 
 - They said

405
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,100
that you must sign this non-disclosure agreement before they can schedule the interview.

406
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,400
Sure.

407
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,420
I'll take this job.

408
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,180
Okay.

409
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,120
Where do I go to start?

410
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,000

411
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,100
Hello? What's the matter?

412
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,300
 Don't just stand stupidly at the entrance. Hurry and go in.

413
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,540
 The interview is about to start.

414
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,560
Jiang Muying, are you spying on me?

415
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,720
No one knows you better than I do.

416
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,240
Su Wei'an, you only dropped out of school. It's not like you dropped out of life.

417
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,400
Just walk back in there with your head held high.

418
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,320
 I'll be waiting for your good news!

419
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,420
All right.

420
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,720

421
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,600
 The treatment for gliomas is mainly surgical intervention.

422
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,420
 However, due to the invasive growth of the tumor,

423
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,420
and the lack of clear boundaries between the tumor and brain tissue, it is difficult to resect it completely.

424
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,620
 Jiang Muying, just you wait.

425
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,480
That classmate who arrived just before the end of class.

426
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,400
You'll answer my last question.

427
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,380
Sorry, Professor. I'm not from your class.

428
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,280
Student Su Wei'an, I know you.

429
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,360
Your name is on the roster.

430
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,880
If you don't have the handout, you can borrow your classmate's.

431
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,520
If you can't answer the question, you can just say you don't know.

432
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,480
At most, this shows your insufficient learning ability,

433
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,920
but deceiving the teacher is a matter of improper attitude.

434
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,020
Okay, Professor. Could you please repeat your question?

435
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,900
How do mutations in IDH  (isocitrate dehydrogenase)  occur?

436
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,300
In most cases, they occur in a mutually exclusive manner.

437
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,980
In gliomas, how do mutations in IDH impact the prognosis of patients?

438
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,320
Mutations in IDH can significantly increase the median survival time of high-grade gliomas,

439
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,480
and may predict the chemotherapy sensitivity of both low-grade and secondary high-grade gliomas.

440
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,280
It is associated with improved patient survival rates.

441
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,820
Very good.

442
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,420
Student Su's answer is perfect.

443
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,120
But since you arrived late, I'll still deduct points from your usual grades.

444
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,520
Student Su, don't let this happen again.

445
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,420
I also hope that all students here will take this as a warning.

446
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,820
Class dismissed.

447
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,540
 Deduct from what usual grades?

448
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,660
 Gu Yunzheng, you're such a drama queen.

449
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,100
Su Wei'an. Su Wei'an!

450
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,960
I told you, I won't work in any medical-related field anymore.

451
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,920
You signed this non-disclosure agreement, right?

452
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,760
So what?

453
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,920
As a medical school professor, aren't you afraid of me exposing you for hiring a translator?

454
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,960
That's why I need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

455
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,300
If you breach the contract, you'll have to pay a penalty.

456
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,520
Don't you still have to interview me?

457
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,680
If I fail the interview, I guess Party A will initiate contract termination.

458
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,460
Congratulations, Student Su. You've successfully passed the interview.

459
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,480
You've read through all the terms of this agreement carefully, right?

460
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,200
After Party B receives the deposit and passes the interview,

461
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,000
if Party B breaches the contract or fails to fulfill the job responsibilities,

462
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,005
they will be required to pay Party A a penalty of ten times the deposit.

463
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:53,590
But I didn't receive your deposit,

464
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,700
so this breach of contract clause isn't valid.

465
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,720

466
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,480

467
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,180
Report to the lab on the third floor at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

468
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,040
There will be a 50 RMB  (7.04 USD)  fine for every minute you're late, with no upper limit.

469
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
You must clock in every day you work.

470
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Any work-related information

471
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,200
and any details about staff cannot be disclosed to outsiders and must be kept confidential.

472
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,240
And here's the last but most important point.

473
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,780
Without my permission, you cannot allow anyone to enter the lab.

474
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:45,440

475
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,480

476
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,620
Pleasure working with you, Student Su.

477
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,160
How can you just push me around like this?

478
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,920
 Jiang Muying, I'll give you half an hour to show up at my place.

479
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,300
Otherwise, the video of you snoring in your sleep will appear in My Moments feed.

480
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,200
Wei'an, I don't even need half an hour. I can be here in half a minute.

481
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,940
Congratulations, Interpreter Su! You've returned with a victory.

482
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,680
What? Is making money not good enough for you?

483
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,360
You already know the answer.

484
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,480
Are you angry?

485
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,880
Jiang Muying,

486
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,760
what benefits did Gu Yunzheng offer you to make you turn against me?

487
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,200
I didn't!

488
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,300
I never turned against you.

489
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,740
The unfair contract you made me sign has put me in trouble.

490
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,440
That's enough, Wei'an.

491
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,800
Stop making a fuss. You've already signed it.

492
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,100
Also, while it's said that people shouldn't compromise for just a bit of money,

493
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,940
this is a lot of money. Just think about it!

494
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,040
If I were as capable as you, I would have eagerly signed this unfair contract myself.

495
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,640
Why can't you understand me?

496
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,200
I don't want to get close to Gu Yunzheng anymore.

497
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,760
Are you still unable to let go of him?

498
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,780
I find him unpleasant.

499
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,740
I think he's arrogant and obnoxious.

500
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,080
That's right. It's good that you dislike him.

501
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,800
I was worried that you liked him, so now I feel relieved.

502
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,400
Let me tell you, I heard that Li Wantong has already made her move

503
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,260
and officially won over Dr. Gu. She's his official girlfriend now.

504
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,240
Don't worry.

505
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Dr. Gu has gotten over you already.

506
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,800
He doesn’t want to be your husband right now. He just wants to be your boss.

507
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,260
Just think of him as a walking money bag, and you'll be done with it after emptying it out.

508
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,500
Su Wei'an, if you keep going on like this, I'll suspect that you still have feelings for Dr. Gu.

509
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,700
Not at all.

510
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,080
Never mind. It's just a job.

511
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,060
There's no medical translation Su Wei'an can't handle.

512
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,400
That's the spirit. Here.

513
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
I spent an entire day preparing this chicken soup.

514
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,460
I'm so exhausted now. Drink it.

515
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,780
From now on, forget about mundane love and focus on making money.

516
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,640
There's nothing I can do about you.

517
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Try it.

518
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,520
- You made it? 
 - Yes.

519
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,880
I...

520
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,800
What's wrong?

521
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,160
Did you remove its organs?

522
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,780
You try it.

523
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,780
 Su Wei'an from Huaren Hospital, Dr. Su, Researcher Su...

524
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,160
 I really wish someone would call me like that.

525
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,200
 Su Wei'an, this is just a temporary job.

526
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,760
 What are you all excited about?

527
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,740
 The doctor said you're not destined for a career in medicine in this lifetime.

528
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,820
Is this worth it for just a temporary job?

529
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,980
Su Wei'an, are you not feeling well?

530
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,296
I'm fine. Thanks for your concern.

531
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:56,100
 When you stop being so pushy and act indifferent towards her instead,

532
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,940
 she'll be the one chasing you.

533
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,000
You're not trying to find some excuse to slack off on work, are you?

534
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,340
What? Do you regret it now?

535
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,000
It's not too late. I'll just consider myself fired.

536
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,980
The lab isn't a place where you can just come and go as you please.

537
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,480
Who wanted to come?

538
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,200
You were the one who forced this on me, okay?

539
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,760
Then hurry up and go through all these subject materials.

540
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,880
They will be helpful for your translation, so use them as a reference.

541
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,300
Don't make me remind you over and over again.

542
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,880
You can't afford to pay the penalty for breach of contract.

543
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,980
There will be a fine of 100 RMB  (14.08 USD)  for each mistake in the translation.

544
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,600
And the fine will be doubled if there are more than five mistakes.

545
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,290
Do you understand?

546
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,500
 You don't know French.

547
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,360
 How would you know if there's a mistake?

548
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,840
Even though I don't know French, don't try to fool me.

549
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,460
These are all first-hand materials from French labs.

550
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,500
If you make a mistake, it means you aren't being responsible to healthcare professionals.

551
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,480
 Do you live in my head?

552
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,480
All right.

553
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,760
But you can't cut back even one penny on the translation fee we agreed on.

554
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,900
Let me remind you. You must clock in and out on your work schedule every day.

555
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,900
There'll be a fine of 100 RMB  (14.08 USD)  for arriving late or leaving early.

556
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,940
And there'll be a fine of 500 RMB for one day of absence.

557
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,260
No eating or drinking in the experimental operation area.

558
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,780
If I find out once, you'll be fined 100 RMB.

559
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,280
Do not touch experimental equipment or specimens without permission.

560
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,980
If you damage them, compensation will be based on the original price.

561
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,860
Other violations will be subject to additional fines based on the severity of the situation.

562
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,360
Student Su Wei'an, many people are eyeing your current position.

563
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,500
Don't embarrass me.

564
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,660
Stupid fines. All you care about is deducting money.

565
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,840
Exploitative Gu.

566
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:11,010

567
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,000
