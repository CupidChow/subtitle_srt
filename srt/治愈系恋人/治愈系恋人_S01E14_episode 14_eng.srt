 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,260
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,340
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,300
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,600
Huaren Hospital International Department.

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,600
They're not in the same building.

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,300
I probably won’t run into Gu Yunzheng, right?

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,800
If I could just catch a glimpse of him from afar.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,300

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,700
 Hi.

22
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,300
- I'd like to register with a psychiatrist. Dr. Li Wantong, please. 
 - Sure, please wait a moment.

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,300
Sorry, Miss. I've looked it up for you.

24
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,580
Dr. Li is fully booked for today. Could I make an appointment for you on Friday morning?

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,880
- Okay, thank you. 
 - You are welcome.

26
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,880
I've made the appointment for you.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,500
Next.

28
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,280
Hello.

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,780
Gu Yunzheng.

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,436
Dr. Li, this is where we work. I hope you will behave yourself.

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,580
I get it. Dr. Gu, from now on, I'll do my job in the hospital and pursue you after work.

32
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,680
Did I not make myself clear?

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,080
Dr. Li. I don't know you at all, and I'm not sure of your intentions.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
But the sure thing is, we are not suitable for each other.

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,600
My purpose is very clear. Your IQ is 145, and mine is 140,

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,700
which means we can make a perfect couple.

37
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have any family history of diseases. So our next generation will have terrific genes,

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,900
born with a winning hand. What could be luckier than that?

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,300
According to your theory, I think you should go to a gene bank to find your other half.

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,000
By that time, you will find that there are a lot of genes better than mine.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,900
If I have to, that could be a solution.

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,600
But for now, fate has brought us together. I won't waste this opportunity.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,150
Don't you think the combination of our good genes is a contribution to human evolution?

44
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,700
I think discussing genetics here is a complete waste of time.

45
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Gu Yunzheng, I'll give you some time to think it over.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,000
You have no reason to reject me.

47
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,300
 And our next generation will definitely have terrific genes,

48
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,600
 born with a winning hand. What could be luckier than that?

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,156
 It's already difficult to be alive. What right do I have to talk about love?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,300
What are you thinking about?

51
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,900
Look at that girl. Do you think she is pretty?

52
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,020
Which one?

53
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,220
The one in leather.

54
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes, she is pretty. Even though I'm a female, I'd like to have her WeChat.

55
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
What's the matter?

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,860
Do you think that if a Harvard M.D. looks like that, there would be no man who doesn't like her?

57
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,360
Such a beautiful woman wouldn't be refused by anyone, even if she is not a Harvard M.D.

58
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,820
When standing together, they're indeed a perfect match.

59
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,580
Wei'an, you've had so much lemon water. Don't you feel sour?

60
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,280
- Let's dance. Come on. 
 - No. I'm not going. I can't dance.

61
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's dance.

62
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Just treat them as if they were nonexistent. Keep dancing, and you'll learn.

63
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,900
Okay, fine. I'm not unhappy. Go find your Fang Mingfan.

64
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,200
It's fine. No need to worry about him. Right now, I have him wrapped around my finger. He comes and goes at my command.

65
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,200
He's a normal person with his worries and dignity.

66
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,900
What do you mean? Has Fang Mingfan fallen for someone else?

67
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,000
How is that possible?

68
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,830
He's close to wearing a sign around his neck that says I am in love.

69
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,223
Look at this.

70
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,300

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,300
Why haven't I seen this post before?

72
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,400
Look at mine.

73
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,600

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,800
It really is.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
I can't believe he blocked me.

76
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,400
Even the sun can have its cloudy days. You should spend more time with him.

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,450

78
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,940
He's inviting me to watch a movie.

79
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,300
Is he trying to pursue me, or…

80
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,000
attempting to or truly trying to pursue me?

81
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,900
No. I already have a boyfriend.

82
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,000
Right. I should make it clear to him.

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,500

84
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,000

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,700
Would this be too much? It's just watching a movie. It's nothing.

86
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,300
Maybe that's because he just returned from abroad and doesn't have many friends.

87
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,600

88
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,900

89
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,400

90
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,300
What is my Dr. Fang doing? Do you miss me?

91
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,400
Provence tomahawk steak

92
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,700
and garlic-flavored shrimp are your favorites.

93
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,834
Not to forget your little quirks.

94
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,800
Everything has to be drizzled with pumpkin soup, right?

95
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,800
How am I doing? Aren't I considerate?

96
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,870
A surprise.

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,300
This is Dr. Fang's exclusive on-duty gift package.

98
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,500
The most crucial liver supplement. Steam eye mask.

99
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,800
You really need sleep spray and vitamins.

100
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
Jiang Jiang.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,400
Jiang Jiang. What's going on with you today? Why are you so nice to me?

102
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,900
Usually, you just order the dishes you like, and it is me who give you gifts.

103
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Have I done something wrong? Tell me if I did something wrong. You don't need to do this.

104
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,000
Why, don't you like it?

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,100
Isn't it only natural for a girlfriend to be kind to her boyfriend?

106
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't like it?

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Then I'll be nice to someone else.

108
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,500
I like it. I like it very much. I just want to know what happened.

109
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,100
You're acting like a completely different person today.

110
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,800
Okay. Then let me ask you.

111
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,200
Why did you block me when you posted to Moments?

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,600
- When? 
 - I saw it.

113
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,400
It's about a lonely little bear or something, with a caption saying life is difficult.

114
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,300
Why did you do that? Who did you send it to? Which girl do you want to care about you?

115
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I didn't mean that at all, Jiang Jiang. I was just passing by a cafe that day and saw a little bear.

116
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,600
And I felt a bit sad at that moment. That's all.

117
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,800
Then why did you block me?

118
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,600
Besides, shouldn't I be this first to know when you encounter difficulties?

119
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,900
No. Jiang Jiang, I... I just didn't want you to feel sad.

120
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,200
I was afraid you'd worry about me. I didn't want my emotions to affect you.

121
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
And it was because of something that happened in the hospital operating room that day.

122
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
It's hard to say in a few words.

123
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,000
It's hard to say in a few words? Then just say a few more words.

124
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Jiang Jiang, let's drop it. Can't we be happy and have a nice meal together?

125
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Let's eat.

126
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,900
I know I'm dumb and useless.

127
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,500
I don't know any of those medical terms that you are familiar with.

128
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,900
I know you just don't want to talk to me. Because you think talking to me is like talking to a wall.

129
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Is that it?

130
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,100
Jiang Jiang, why do you misunderstand me? That really wasn't what I was thinking at the time.

131
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,500
I blocked you back then just because I didn't want you to worry about me.

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,900
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,100
I didn't consider your feelings.

134
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,900
But I really don't mean to think less of you.

135
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,000
Then tell me now. What kind of trouble did you encounter?

136
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,110
I don't deserve to know it, is that it?

137
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,800
Fang Mingfan, you don't have to tell me anything anymore.

138
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't want to hear it either.

139
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,200
From now on, your joys or sorrows have nothing to do with me as long as you are happy.

140
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Jiang Jiang.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Jiang Jiang. Jiang Jiang!

142
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,300
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

143
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,320
A'Ying.

144
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,500
Brother Xiao Kai.

145
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,400
You don't look so good. Are you feeling unwell?

146
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,300
No. Maybe I didn't sleep well last night. I'm a bit tired.

147
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,700
How about we reschedule for another day?

148
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,200
Don't worry. I am fine. We're already here.

149
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Just let me know if you feel unwell.

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,200
Let's go. Wait a moment. I need to tell my mom.

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Mom, I'm going to the movies with Xiao Ying, and I cannot go shopping with you.

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can only shop by yourselves.

153
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,400
Let's take a picture.

154
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,800
Smile.

155
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,300
All right, let's go.

156
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,700
Dr. Gu, there are no more surgeries today. You can go home and get some rest.

157
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,100
Okay, got it. Thank you.

158
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,600
No need to work overtime today.

159
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Why don't you go on a date with your girlfriend?

160
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,700
I almost don't have a girlfriend anymore.

161
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,300
What happened? Did you have a fight?

162
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,200
To be precise, I made her angry.

163
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,000
She just wanted to comfort me, but I...

164
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,500
She was right. I was just feeling sorry for myself.

165
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
Look at this.

166
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,700
I've made so many calls, but she didn't answer.

167
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,300
First, she didn't answer the phone. Then she blocked me on WeChat.

168
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,500
And finally, she disappeared without a word and went without a trace.

169
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,200
I know this all too well.

170
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Boss, she didn't block me. It's just you who didn't make it through.

171
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,300
Just kidding.

172
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,600
She only blocked you and didn't delete you, which means there's still hope for you.

173
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Is there a difference between block and delete?

174
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,000
Of course, there is.

175
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,800
If she deletes you, it is to erase all of your memories,

176
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,500
like the chat history, the pictures, and the videos you sent are all gone.

177
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,900
But If she blocks you, you are just not chatting temporarily.

178
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
That makes sense.

179
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
In terms of love skills, I do have a little more experience than you.

180
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,500
My Jiang Muying is probably just temporarily ignoring me.

181
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,100
You look like you're going to live alone forever.

182
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm going to live alone forever because of you.

183
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,900
What did I do wrong again?

184
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,000
Last time, I was actually going to clear things up with Su Wei'an but was called back for surgery by you.

185
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm sorry, Boss. I really didn't know at the time.

186
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,000
Fang Mingfan, I can give you a chance to make amends.

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
I want to meet Su Wei'an.

188
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,600
Su Wei'an?

189
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,400
Where can I find Su Wei'an? I don't have her contact information.

190
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,821
Su Wei'an is in China right now. Your girlfriend meets her frequently.

191
00:16:03,821 --> 00:16:06,860
I don't care what tricks you use.

192
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,960
If I can't meet the person I want to see,

193
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,200
then you'll never get to see the person you want to see.

194
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,700
Okay.

195
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
Understood.

196
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,800
I'll go make up with Jiang Muying now and then bring Su Wei'an in front of you.

197
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,700
Then why don't you go right away?

198
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,290

199
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,400
Wei'an, I'm your most loyal fan.

200
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Don't let my passion intimidate you.

201
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,700
You've done a great job with the atmosphere here. You can ask the boss for your salary later.

202
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,800
Today, I'll show you what it means to be a one-person team.

203
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Where's Fang Mingfan? Doing surgery?

204
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Don't mention him. We haven't contacted for quite a few days.

205
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,300
Let it be.

206
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,100
Reconciliation is just one step from the fight. It depends on who takes that step first.

207
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,800
Then why should I be the one to take the step? Can't he take that step first?

208
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,400
Of course he can, but it could have different outcomes.

209
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,500
It's like if he misses a step, it might be just a scrape.

210
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,300
But if he rolls down the stairs, then it's all over.

211
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,800

212
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,800

213
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,890

214
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,600
Wei'an, you're here.

215
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,100
I'd like to introduce to you a mystery guest.

216
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,900
Who?

217
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,500
- Wei'an. 
 - Senior Brother? What are you doing here?

218
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,900
All right, today's performance is up to you. You guys have a good chat.

219
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,000
Senior Brother, do you remember me?

220
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,600
Jiang Muying, Wei'an's best friend.

221
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,800
I remember everyone related to Wei'an.

222
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,000
Senior Brother, you know this place well. Do you come here often?

223
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,860
This is a secret between me and Brother Hui.

224
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

225
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Do you want something to drink?

226
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,140
Waiter.

227
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,000

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800

229
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,410
She posted to Moments with her location added.

230
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,440
Fang Mingfan, can't you understand this? No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

231
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,900

232
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,200
Su Wei'an?

233
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,900
She found a new love so quickly.

234
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,300
It's a pity that boss was still waiting. I didn't expect her to be such a woman.

235
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,300

236
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
 He finally left.

237
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,400

238
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,900
 Hello, the number you've dialed is busy.

239
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:04,600

240
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,200
All right, then you pay more attention to this patient.

241
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,800
 Hello, the number you've dialed is busy.

242
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
-  Please dial later.  
 - He's not answering my calls.

243
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,800

244
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,600

245
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,400

246
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,900
It’s One Way Bar again.

247
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Senior Brother.

248
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,100
What kind of secret could you and Brother Hui have? You're making it seem so mysterious.

249
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,500
Next, a perfect combination,

250
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,500
the soul drummer and her guitar prince will put on the melody of love.

251
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,100
Old partner, let's relive the glory of the Huaren Band.

252
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,600

284
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,400
Aren't you the same?

285
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:11,700
President Du, who has a packed schedule, turns out to be an artist playing the guitar to charm the ladies.

286
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,000
You're good at it.

287
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,520
I learned it for Wei'an and practiced for a long time
to match her drumbeats.

288
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,120
If you can't match it, just give up. Love cannot be forced.

289
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,920

290
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,220
Brother Xiao Kai. You call him so affectionately.

291
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,420
What's the matter? Is it not okay?

292
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,820
I thought you were mad at me these past few days, so I'm afraid to disturb you.

293
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,200
But it turns out you're flirting with some Brother Xiao Kai.

294
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,900
What are you talking about? He's my childhood friend, why wouldn't I call him Brother?

295
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,500
- Really? 
 - Believe it or not.

296
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,700
How did you know I was here?

297
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,000
You posted on Moments with location sharing. Were you worried that I couldn't find you?

298
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
How could it be?

299
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,700
Did I post it? I didn't notice.

300
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,900
If I hadn't arrived in time, you would have run off with that Brother Xiao Kai.

301
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,100
Are you jealous?

302
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
No man can stand it.

303
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,000
Calling you an angel with a heart emoji. Ugh, a slick guy.

304
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,400
You even called him “Brother.” You have never called me like that.

305
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Brother.

306
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,500
Brother.

307
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,900
Brother Mingfan.

308
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay. You'd better call me by my full name.

309
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,800
Jiang Jiang. Jiang Jiang.

310
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Jiang Jiang.

311
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,800
I reflected on it that day. I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

312
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,500
Boss asked me to perform surgery, but I still couldn't overcome my mental barrier.

313
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,700
I was afraid I'd mess it up.

314
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,700
It was my fault that day. I spoke too harshly and was too mean to you.

315
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:50,100
I was afraid you'd think I was useless and couldn't do anything right.

316
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,600
I was more afraid that I was not even qualified to be your listener.

317
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,400
How is that possible? I was afraid...

318
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,700
I was afraid that after I told you, you'd think I was useless.

319
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Compared to Boss, who can do anything,

320
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm insignificant.

321
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,700
How could it be? You are already much stronger than me.

322
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,800
Although you've faced setbacks and difficulties, you never gave up.

323
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
Because you have dreams.

324
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,800
In my eyes, you always shine brightly.

325
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,960
Really?

326
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
Alone?

327
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,600
What are you doing? My boyfriend is right over there. Don't mess around.

328
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
You're no fun.

329
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,600
Do you want to know where single girls are?

330
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,100
Where?

331
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,500
Right over there. The girl who was playing the drums.

332
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:35,400
I know her. She's never had a boyfriend and is eager to fall in love.

333
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,800
I wonder if you're the man of her dreams.

334
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,100
She's really lovely.

335
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,300
There's no girl I can't flirt with.

336
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,100
- Really? 
 - You will see.

337
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,000
You can do it.

338
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,700
Su Wei'an. You asked for it.

339
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,670
Hi, Sister. I've been watching you for a while.

340
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,192
The way you were playing the drums just now was really cool. I love it.

341
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:08,300
- Don't leave just yet. 
 - Are you drunk?

342
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,700
I'm not drunk. Come on.

343
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,400
Waiter, please give him a glass of honey water.

344
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,900
That's great. You're going to feed me, aren't you? Come on.

345
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,300
Let's have a drink together.

346
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,600
If you continue like this, I'll call security.

347
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,900
You little girl, stop pretending to be aloof with me.

348
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,300
- Come on. 
 - Let go of me.

349
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,600
You've got a temper, don't you? Let me see how tough you are.

350
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,300
Who are you? Mind your own business.

351
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,100
I'm really sorry, Brother.

352
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,000
I haven't practiced Ju-Jitsu for a long time. Seeing the sitting ducks like you, I just couldn't help it.

353
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,300
I'll tell you what. Even though you stink and you're ugly, you are suitable as the sitting ducks.

354
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,900
I'm really sorry, Brother.

355
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
You? Where did you come from?

356
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,700
Let me tell you. You'd better get out of here quickly before I get angry.

357
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,000
Or I'll give you a good kick.

358
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm leaving.

359
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,800
- Don't move. 
 - Are you okay?

360
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,900
Call the boss.

361
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,900
Listen, I've already called the police. Don't play tricks.

362
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,800
What kind of jerk who dares to bully her?

363
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,770
Boss,

364
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,900
could you please check the bar's security cameras for me?

365
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,600
I want to know if there are any details we don't know.

366
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,700
Don't worry. business is my business.

367
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,700
- Boss. 
 - I'll be there shortly.

368
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,300
- So when I'm done here, I'll take you to check the security cameras. 
 - Okay.

369
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,330
You're not hurt, are you?

370
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
That's good.

371
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,300
Gu Yunzheng, I knew you cared about me.

372
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,700
If you hadn't been there just now, I might have got hurt.

373
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,300
Dr. Gu, won't you introduce your friend to us?

374
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,500
- Let me introduce myself. My name is Li Wantong. I'm Dr. Gu's… 
 - colleague.

375
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Just colleague.

376
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,800
It's a bit strange. It's a feeling I can't describe.

377
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,000
Who is this lady? You know her?

378
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,100
She's a Harvard M.D. in the Psychological Department at Huaren Hospital.

379
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,700
She is Boss's pursuer.

380
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,100
She's a Harvard woman with a M.D.?

381
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,980
Impressive, right?

382
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,400
I remember now. Wei’an mentioned her last time.

383
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,800
Since we're all gathered here, how about having a drink and getting to know each other?

384
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Yeah, that's right. Why is everyone still standing here? Let's drink and talk. Let's go.

385
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,500
I won't be joining you. I have to perform.

386
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Wei'an, you don't have to perform today. Just have a good drink
and chat with your friends.

387
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Don't worry. You'll still get paid. I'll cover all the expenses today.

388
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,600
Let me arrange it. I'm here if you need anything.

389
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,700
Su Wei'an,

390
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,700
your boss told you to stay. Are you still going to run away?

391
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,900
Why would I run away?

392
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:54,100
So, why don't we sit together, chat and have fun?

393
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,400
I don't have time. I'm busy.

394
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,700
Is there any kind of painful past between Miss Su and Dr. Gu?

395
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Otherwise, why would it trigger such a strong psychological defense in Miss Su?

396
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,300
You're overthinking it. There was nothing special between us in the past. I just don't want to talk.

397
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,000
So, let's all sit together and chat.

398
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

399
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,200
Wei'an, let's sit for a while.

400
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,100
It's not fun to chat at a bar.

401
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,700
Let's play games.

402
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,100
These games are all too complicated.

403
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,000
Let's play something simple.

404
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,300

405
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,200
Truth or Dare.

406
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,192
Professor Gu, Truth or Dare is outdated.

407
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,320
Let's play "The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow". It's a fun game.

408
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,920
The music is so loud here. Are you sure you want to play it?

409
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,463
Yes, Jiang Jiang. I can't even hear what you're saying.

410
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:14,160
Everyone, let's just play Truth or Dare.

411
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,485
This game can help us get to know each other faster.

412
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:20,085
I'll take the lead, Dr. Gu.

413
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,500

414
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,800
I choose Truth.

415
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,400

416
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,300
Is there someone of the opposite sex in this gathering whom you like?

417
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,200
Yes.

418
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:47,303
Who?

419
00:36:47,303 --> 00:36:50,553
This is the next question. Dr. Li, it's your turn.

420
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:52,653
Okay.

421
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
What is your ideal type?

422
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,600
My ideal type is someone like Dr. Gu.

423
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,800
He is handsome, intelligent, emotionally stable and healthy.

424
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,500
It's my turn now.

425
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I choose Truth.

426
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,500

427
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,500
What would you say to the one you love?

428
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll tell her that the sights are still there.

429
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Where have you been when you were supposed to see the sights with me?

430
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,200
Dr. Gu, you are so romantic. You have increased my admiration for you.

431
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Fang Mingfan, it's your turn.

432
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll do it.

433
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,000
I choose Truth.

434
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,600
Okay.

435
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,300

436
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,700
Share a secret about the previous player.

437
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,080
Boss has so many secrets. I don't know which one to tell.

438
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,380
I choose to drink.

439
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,080
Drank it all.

440
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,480
How come none of you choose Dare? Dare is more fun.

441
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,580
I'll choose Dare.

442
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,900
Share the first contact you recently called. Say I love you to the one.

443
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,200
What?

444
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,300

445
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I choose to drink too.

446
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,320
What are you drinking for? Who is the first contact you recently called?

447
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,060
It's the courier.

448
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,200
You know that. I order so much stuff every day.

449
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,960
If I call him and say "I love you.” How weird that would be.

450
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,820
And the courier knows my address. It's not safe.

451
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,600
Why didn't you tell me? I'll drink it for you.

452
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,700
You will have the chance to drink it later.

453
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,200
Wei'an, it's your turn. Truth or Dare?

454
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,500
Choose Truth.

455
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,800
What's great about this game is that you can hear things you don't usually hear.

456
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,300
But I like to play Dare.

457
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,000
Yes, Wei'an likes adventures.

458
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,000
Look at the person directly across from you for 30 seconds.

459
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,600
Su Wei'an, what's the matter? You don't even have the guts
to look me in the eyes?

460
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,900
Come over.

461
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,300
Su Wei'an, look me in the eyes.

462
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,920
I'll time it.

463
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Ready, go.

464
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,940

465
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,500
Boring.

466
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Is this boring to you? I think it's quite fun.

467
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,500
At least it gives me a chance to ask you why you disappeared without a word.

468
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,200
Everybody, Miss Jiang Muying just dedicated a song to all of you.

469
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,300
Let's all put our hands in their air and dance.

470
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,020
Dr. Gu,

471
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,000
the most important thing for adults in a relationship is to be responsible for themselves.

472
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
The past is the past, even if it's beautiful.

473
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,500
Wei'an has moved on now. Why are you stuck in the past?

474
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,900
You're making everyone unhappy.

475
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,600
Did I make her unhappy?

476
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,000
Yes.

477
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
Life is not easy for Wei'an.

478
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,700
I beg you, Dr. Gu. Please stay away from her and stop putting so much pressure on her.

479
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,885
Wei'an, are you okay? Is there a story between you and Gu Yunzheng?

480
00:41:55,885 --> 00:41:58,000
- Seeing you two were... 
 - There isn't.

481
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,800
When we were in Lakaya, he was a doctor and I was an interpreter.

482
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,600
We were just work partners.

483
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,600
Maybe I left too abruptly and didn't explain things to him clearly. So there might be some misunderstanding.

484
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,600
Besides that, there's nothing else.

485
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:24,000
Actually, I really like being with you. I can take off the mask and stay away from competition.

486
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's nice to live life to the fullest.

487
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Wei'an, actually, you can be like this too. You can tell me what's bothering you.

488
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,800
But compared to an exciting life,

489
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,000
what I want more is a peaceful and lasting one.

490
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,700
You know, you don't have to push yourself too hard. Just relax and be yourself.

491
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,265
But I don't have time anymore.

492
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:53,965
Why?

493
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I…

494
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:10,970

495
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,030
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

496
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,100
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

497
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,800
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

498
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,100

499
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,900
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,700
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

502
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:50,000
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

503
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,200
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

504
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,200
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

505
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,300
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

506
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,400
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

507
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,700
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫
