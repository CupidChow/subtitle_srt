 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,260
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,640
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her admist the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,820
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,080

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,880

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,480
Deduction. All you know is deduction.

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,900
What a mean boss.

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,860
 The files that Gu Yunzheng wants me to translate are all related to gene editing technology.

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,780
 This technology has been effectively applied to the treatment of serious illnesses.

20
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,380
 Why would he suddenly start to care about gene editing technology?

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,900
 Why do I care about what he cares? I'll just do the job and get paid.

22
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,020

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,220
Dr. Gu, what's the good news today? Why are you so happy? Share it with us.

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,380
Yeah. Tell us to share the fun.

25
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,420
I spent some money so I'm happy.

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,980
Buy something? for what?

27
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,920
Oh, you mentioned yesterday that there's a nice new tonic diet restaurant near the hospital.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,880
There's a soup good for the stomach. What is it called again?

29
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,360
I'm starving.

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,920
Dr. Gu, what did you buy? Smells great.

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,500
A tonic diet restaurant opened nearby.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,880
I just tried it with my girlfriend and brought back some chicken soup.

33
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,440
Su Wei'an, would you like to have it?

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,300
It'll be such a waste if you don't.

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,920
Do you see me as a beggar?

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,720
This restaurant is super expensive. The average charge is over 300 RMB.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,760
It's still fresh and clean. I'll throw it away if you don't eat it.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,480
Such an expensive chicken. What a waste if you do.

39
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,200
Hey, if you're really not hungry, you don't have to eat it. There's no need to do me this favor.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,760
Don't flatter yourself. I'm doing the chicken a favor.

41
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,920
Go ahead.

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,300
Saving food starts with me.

43
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:59,740
♫  Forgotten conversations, every word filled with innocence  ♫

44
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:07,220
♫  My eyes fall on the lingering warmth of your palm  ♫

45
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,740
♫  Occasionally my heart is racing fast,   ♫

46
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,120
♫  feeling unsettle from a nightmare  ♫

47
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,730
♫  Forgive me for relying too much  ♫

48
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,440
♫  on your hugs for comfort  ♫

49
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,920
♫  Your secret  ♫

50
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,760
♫  I was able to hear you sleep talk while you dream  ♫

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:39,380
♫  With a smile, I'm secretly writing down all your wishes  ♫

52
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,770
♫  My secret  ♫

53
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,765
♫  I've forgotten that I was so alone  ♫

54
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:54,855
♫  I'm hoping in the future, you'd still be tugging on the corner of my sleeves  ♫

55
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:59,640
♫  I'm loving you  ♫

♫  Oh~ woah~  ♫

57
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,540
♫  Oh~ woah~  ♫

58
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,450
♫  Your secret  ♫

59
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,520
♫  Luckily, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

60
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,340
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

61
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,890
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

62
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,800
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

63
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
♫  My secret  ♫

64
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,360
♫  I've forgotten that I was lonely once  ♫

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,320
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,600
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

67
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,980
♫  Oh~ woah~  ♫

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,900
It's delicious.

69
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,200
Dr. Gu, are we going to have night snacks again?

70
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,900
Well... This one's isn't easy to share.

71
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,380
Okay.

72
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,680
Boss, you're bringing meals for Su Wei'an every day in every way possible.

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,380
Aren't you tired?

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,260
Who says I'm bringing meals for her?

75
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,380
Yeah, yeah. It's all your girlfriend's leftovers.

76
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,120
None of us mind continuing to be your girlfriend.

77
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,480
Are you having too much free time?

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,060

79
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,360
So? Good chicken soup, right?

80
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
Are you sure

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,880
this is her leftover?

82
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,800
My girlfriend is on a diet. She only drinks soup and won't have meat.

83
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,060
As for me, I'm trying my best to be good to her. But she insists on losing weight.

84
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,500
These are all prepared by me with love. It'll be a waste if thrown away.

85
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,820
 If she's really well-shaped, why lose weight anyway?

86
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,480
You're enjoying it, huh?

87
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,720
Leave the other one to me.

88
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,000
Didn't you eat with your girlfriend?

89
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,460
She needs to keep fit. So she didn't eat much.

90
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,460
As her boyfriend, neither can I.

91
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,260
Su Wei'an.

92
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,980
- Too late. 
 - You...

93
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,960
I already ate it.

94
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,780
Go ahead.

95
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
Why are you looking at me? Got nothing else to do?

96
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,120

97
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,750
Wei'an.

98
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,260
Senior Brother, what brings you here?

99
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,700
I was coincidently nearby the hospital. I saw your WeChat post.

100
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,820
Seems like you're in Huaren's lab.

101
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,550
So I thought I could drop by. And you're really here.

102
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,540
Such keen observation, Senior Brother.

103
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,550
What are you doing here?

104
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:35,955
I was hired by Gu Yunzheng for a job.

105
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,000
Rejecting Jiehui and working for Gu Yunzheng.

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,980
Are you two together or something?

107
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
No way.

108
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,820
He has a girlfriend. I'm just here to work.

109
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:55,440
The two of us are simply the relationship of boss and employee.

110
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,100
How I miss those days when we did experiments together.

111
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,120
Stop bringing it up.

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,460
You used to ask me to help tranquilize rabbits. You had no idea how fierce they were.

113
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,780
I remember the first time I saw you, you were pinning a rabbit with excitement in your eyes.

114
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,060
You said the rabbit's ear veins were so clear and so easy to give shots.

115
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,080
Just admit it. You're just scared of animals with fur.

116
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,160
You're with fur. I'm not scared.

117
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,320
I'm packing my things to get off work.

118
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,260
Let me give you a lift.

119
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,860
Sure.

120
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,340
Su Wei'an.

121
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,860
I've sent the files to your mailbox. Stop asking me to work overtime.

122
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,640
What's the hurry? I'm not finished yet.

123
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,140
I've filled out this HDQ39 Adverse Event Report.

124
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,840
I'll give this and your aunt's medical record to Professor Wen.

125
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,840
HDQ39? Let me have a look.

126
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,740
This is my lab. Unauthorized people aren't allowed in.

127
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,220
How childish.

128
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,980
Then we won't add to your trouble. I'll send this to Professor Wen myself.

129
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,900
Senior Brother, let's go.

130
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000

131
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:52,240
Wei'an, is Gu Yunzheng sure that the aneurysm rupture is related to the drug test?

132
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,036
He's not certain yet.

133
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:58,880
He just reported my aunt's case to the subject facilitator according to normal procedures.

134
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,760
As for the next step,  it is up to Professor Wen to confirm whether the aneurysm has anything to do with HDQ39.

135
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,020
Who would've thought? The research took so long but didn't pan out.

136
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,460
Actually, I want to meet Professor Wen to confirm the grouping because I hope

137
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,240
that my aunt's aneurysm is just a special case.

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,620
If he can confirm that what my aunt took were placebos, that would be great.

139
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,720
This means HDQ39 is okay.

140
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,260
If HDQ39 really is flawed, I'd rather end it myself.

141
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,720
Senior Brother, don't be so disheartened yet.

142
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,520
This drug carries the hope of millions of people.

143
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,900
You shouldn't give up until the very last moment.

144
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,360
Besides,

145
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,228
I really wish that HDQ39 will come into the market.

146
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,060
Then you should give the files to Professor Wen as soon as possible, so he can report to the Ethics Committee

147
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,100
and let the latter review the safety of this drug, which is the fairest.

148
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
But tomorrow is the weekend. The hospital only operates on workdays.

149
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,240
I wonder if Gu Yunzheng will grant me leave next week.

150
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,160
By then, there must be loads of work waiting for me.

151
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,920
This is easy. Come to Jiehui tomorrow morning.

152
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,860
Okay.

153
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,940
This is an urgent delivery. Make sure it's delivered to Professor Wen today.

154
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,740
Okay.

155
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,020
Wei'an, rest assured.

156
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,340
If it's a file from Jiehui, Professor Wen will definitely read it.

157
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,420
Thanks for another favor, Senior Brother.

158
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,200
No trouble at all.

159
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,920
Come on, I'll treat you to dinner.

160
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,360
But let's be clear first. No mushrooms with beef today.

161
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
Let me take you somewhere first.

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,220
Sophie Carver. A famous woman photographer who herself is handicapped.

163
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,080
She's been shooting people with rare diseases around the globe.

164
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,440
I saw on Photoworld that she's holding an exhibition in Prague, so I invited her to hold one in China.

165
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:49,100
I hope these photos can encourage patients with HD to raise hope for life again.

166
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,740
The purpose of us holding this exhibition is to call on society to pay attention to people with rare diseases.

167
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,060
All the money from donations during the exhibition will be used for funding the families of patients with rare diseases.

168
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,600
   ]  
  [The youngest patient with HD from India]

169
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,620
She's so young.

170
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,920
Maybe I've been devoted to this project for too long.

171
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,200
Sometimes, when I see the looks of despair on the patients, my heart aches.

172
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,220
Every day I ask myself if we can be a little faster.

173
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,920
So the wonder drug will be available to them sooner. So we can save one more patient earlier.

174
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,220
This also means we can save one more family.

175
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,420
Let's go.

176
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120

177
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,240
Su Wei'an?

178
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,140
Why would she use Jiehui's express envelope?

179
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,200
What's she reaching my dad for?

180
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800

181
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,220
 Su Wei'an, you snatched my boyfriend.

182
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,260
 Now you're ruining my dad's experiment.

183
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,060
 Are you deliberately against me?

184
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,020

185
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,560
President Du, Miss Wen is at the company.

186
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,240
Hi, Miss Wen.

187
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,640
President Du is visiting clients this morning. I'm not sure if he'll be back.

188
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,220
It's fine. I'll be waiting for him here.

189
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,940
Sure.

190
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,980
By the way, there's an exhibition nearby sponsored by Jiehui.

191
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,260
If you're feeling bored, feel free to take a look.

192
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,900
Excuse me for now.

193
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,780

194
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,020

195
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,360

196
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,180
- Hello? 
  - Hi, deliveries for Gu Yunzheng.

197
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,420
Deliveries for Gu Yunzheng?

198
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,240
 Yes, at the gate of Huaren Hospital.

199
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,960
One moment, please. I'll be down there soon.

200
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,580
So heavy.

201
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,220
Where is he?

202
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,480
He told me to fetch his deliveries, but he's not here.

203
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,520
Dr. Gu, I've fetched your deliveries for you. I won't do this again.

204
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm your translator, not your assistant.

205
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,460
 Translator Su, kindly try these foods for me.

206
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,480
 Tell me if they're delicious. I'm sending these to my girlfriend soon.

207
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,120
Try them?

208
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,000
Dr. Gu, I'm your translator, not your lab rat.

209
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,200
 I'll pay you extra.

210
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,460
I'd be a fool to turn money down.

211
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,400
Not bad.

212
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,780
What a coincidence. Just got off work?

213
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,480
- How come you're here? 
 - If you take a taxi at this hour, you definitely won't find one.

214
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I'll drive you home.

215
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,460
Don't overthink.

216
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,520
I just don't want to see anything happen to my translator on her way home.

217
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,337
Hop in.

218
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,920
Why did you get off?

219
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,620
Su Wei'an?

220
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,320
Get off.

221
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,300
Get out of the car.

222
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,340
Wait, what?

223
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,140
Get in the car.

224
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,960
You can barely keep your eyes open. I don't want to die from fatigue driving.

225
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,360
But be reminded. You have to pay extra for this.

226
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,820
Fine.

227
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,880
I know my way home. Just sleep. Don't worry.

228
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,320
I'll let you drive when I get home.

229
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,120
Su Wei'an,

230
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,640
will I find myself alone in the wild when I wake up from my sleep?

231
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,620
What?

232
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,620
You're also aware that you've done too much evil that karma might get back at you?

233
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,860
No worries. My driving skills are good.

234
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,680
- I'll take a nap then. 
 - Mm.

235
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,400
It's raining.

236
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,980
Your... Your car is too dirty.

237
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,620
I've arrived.

238
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,900
Well...

239
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,760
The experiment data... I've translated two-thirds already.

240
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,920
Did the soda crackers taste good?

241
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,720
What?

242
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,720
The soda crackers.

243
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,930
I'm going to send them to my girlfriend.

244
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,260
They taste bad. Really bad.

245
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,180
Besides, who gives soda crackers to his girlfriend as a gift?

246
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,840
I'm leaving.

247
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,420
She's jealous.

248
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,980
Being jealous is a good sign.

249
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,890
Seems like I can push even further.

254

Coming home so late? Did you have supper?

255
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,860
No. Did you cook anything?

256
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,920
I thought you wouldn't eat at home. So I just had some snacks.

257
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,060
I didn't cook. Come on. Have some of these.

258
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,780
Soda crackers that won't gain you weight.

259
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,200
Buy one, get one free at the supermarket. What a steal, huh?

260
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,840
This one's yours, and this one's mine.

261
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,260
I hate soda crackers the most. Don't you know that?

262
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,020
What do you have against crackers?

263

♪  Are you also waiting  ♪

264
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,060
 Right. Why are you mad at the crackers?

265
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,460
 What exactly are you mad at?

266
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,040
 Isn't this nice? The simple boss-employee relationship.

267
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,280
Wei'an, why do you look chubbier after being tortured by Gu Yunzheng?

268
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,240
What chubbier?

269
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,200
This is obesity due to overwork.

270
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,020
I wonder what Gu Yunzheng's up to.

271
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,725
He keeps feeding me his and his girlfriend's leftovers.

272
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,740
Well, you can choose not to.

273
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,180
Rejecting it won't count as a violation, right?

274
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,460
But the thing is, they don't look like leftovers at all.

275
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,980
Never mind. I'll just eat them as work meals.

276
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,040
It's Dr. Li.

277
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,800
Then could the one beside her be...

278
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,240
Bye.

279
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,060
Eliot?

280
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,560

281
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,640
Eliot has come to China?

282
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,540
Why would he be with Li Wantong?

283
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,280
Dr. Gu and Dr. Li's relationship doesn't seem to have gone well, huh?

284
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:57,780
 Does he know about this or not?

285
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,060
 Should I tell him?

286
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,890

287
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,430

288
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,760
 He hasn't sent messages to me for days.

289
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,600
Today's operations are all Dr. Gu's?

290
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,740
Yeah, I heard that he asked for that.

291
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,340
And he's been sullen these two days. Seems like someone has offended him.

292
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,360

293
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
You scared me.

294
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,420
Are you looking for me or my boss? Why didn't you make a sound?

295
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,000
Fang Mingfan, for how focused you were, I'm certain that you'll be an excellent surgeon.

296
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,720
Really?

297
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,620
I'm here for Dr. Gu.

298
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,680
He's in the operating room. I'm afraid you won't see him today.

299
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,200
Why is he having so many operations lately?

300
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,760
Isn't he always like this?

301
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,640
He said he was busy this week and told me to schedule this operation myself.

302
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,620
But it's already Tuesday, and I haven't figured out the operation approach yet.

303
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,880
Take a look?

304
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,760
The lesion isn't big.

305
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,040
We've done an evaluation. Pick the approach that you're most sure of.

306
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,220
Dr. Fang, considering your mental status,

307
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,560
since it took you two years after failing your first operation to gain the courage again,

308
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,060
you'd better make no mistake this time.

309
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,980
So you can build confidence again and gradually desensitize yourself to that accident.

310
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,660
This is both being responsible to you and your patient.

311
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,460
Although the approach with minimal damage to the patient is quite difficult to operate with,

312
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,420
Dr. Fang has practiced it numerous times. It's already engraved on his mind.

313
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,040
On the operating table, shouldn't doctors be purely focused?

314
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,460
Picking up the scalpel is for doing what's best for the patient.

315
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,380
If you put your personal honor before your patient,

316
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,820
you'll never become a qualified surgeon.

317
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,320
You'd better change your profession.

318
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,980
Give patients the best treatment.

319
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,880
It's the same as my boss said.

320
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,040
I see.

321
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,880
Thank you, Su Wei'an.

322
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,980
Su Wei'an,

323
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
you seem to have a problem with me.

324
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,260
No.

325
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm a psychologist. That's the least I can tell.

326
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,980
You're overthinking.

327
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,040
Well, Dr. Li. Dr. Gu is a good man.

328
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,060
Even if you want to friend zone Gu Yunzheng, you shouldn't do this to me, right?

329
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,580
Of course, I know he's a good man.

330
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,640
Otherwise, previously, I wouldn't have chased him so hard.

331
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,480
Since you've made him your boyfriend, I hope that you will cherish him.

332
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,130
Adults should be responsible for their own actions. Do not hurt people's feelings.

333
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,020
Wait, what? I've made Gu Yunzheng my boyfriend?

334
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,480
Why didn't I know such a good thing?

335
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,540
Su Wei'an.

336
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,860
What now?

337
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm telling you, Su Wei'an.

338
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,860
My dad spent more than a decade developing that drug. There can't be anything wrong.

339
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,040
Your aunt's aneurysm is purely bad luck.

340
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,580
It has nothing to do with HDQ39.

341
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,700
You secretly read my aunt's Adverse Event Report?

342
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,840
Didn't you mail it to my home especially for me to read?

343
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,260
You even used a Jiehui express envelope.

344
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,480
What?

345
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,840
Are you trying to declare that Du Yuncheng is yours?

346
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,460
Except for members of the research team, no one's authorized to read that report. Don't you know that?

347
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,980
Not only did I read it, I also tore it up.

348
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,900
What can you do with me?

349
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,780
Wen Ran, you're a medical student, too.

350
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,000
Don't you know that during the drug trial,

351
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,260
any adverse event must be reported to the development team as soon as it's discovered?

352
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,440
This is the formal procedure.

353
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,360
Stop giving me the procedure talk.

354
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,080
I'm telling you, Su Wei'an. You're also a carrier of the HD gene.

355
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,640
HDQ39 is the most promising specific drug to go on the market.

356
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,960
If you ever dare to ruin it, you'll be ruining yourself, too.

357
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,620
I'm sorry, Wei'an.

358
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,380
I did it in too much of a hurry.

359
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,660
I didn't expect that it was opened by Wen Ran after being delivered to Professor Wen's home.

360
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm thinking, is it possible that Professor Wen didn't even know about this?

361
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,740
It's possible.

362
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,700
Then I'll send another copy to Zhang He Hospital.

363
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,500
No need. I'll go there personally.

364
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,580
I'll deliver it to Professor Wen. This is safer.

365
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,740
Good.

366
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,080

367
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,380
Director Yang, do you still remember me?

368
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,740
- Can I help you? 
 - I'd like to meet Prof. Wen. Where's his office, please?

369
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,700
Professor Wen is out for a meeting. You can tell me if there's anything.

370
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,460
Here's the thing.

371
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,980
In Phase III of the HDQ39 clinical trial, there's a subject called Su Yuan.

372
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,680
Does it ring a bell?

373
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,360
Yes, I think so. What is it?

374
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,120
After the drug test, she had two aneurysm ruptures.

375
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,760
I'm not sure if they're caused by HDQ39.

376
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,580
This is an Adverse Event Report prepared by me. Her medical record is also in it.

377
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,460
If it's not too much trouble, please give it to Professor Wen for me.

378
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,300
Okay. I'll give it to him as soon as possible.

379
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,250
Thank you.

380
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,480
If it's convenient, could you give me his contact information?

381
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,360
I'd like to tell him personally.

382
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,520
Professor Wen is a busy man. You can send emails to our public mailbox on our website.

383
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,860
I check the inbox every day.

384
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,500
Okay, thank you.

385
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,820

386
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,740

387
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,340

388
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,540

389
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
- This won't do. 
 - Okay.

390
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,280
Su Wei'an, why are you here so late?

391
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,920
Are you feeling unwell?

392
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,660
No. I was handling some personal things.

393
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,280
Handling personal things during work hours?

394
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,160
This is absenteeism.

395
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,820
Look at the time now.

396
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,140
The files I delivered to Professor Wen were blocked by Wen Ran.

397
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,160
I went to Zhang He Hospital this morning to resubmit them.

398
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,680
Go ahead if you want to deduct my pay. It's your lab after all.

399
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,480
You could've just explained it.

400
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,580
It's not like I'll do it every time.

401
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,500
You know what. Zhang He Hospital is known for its low efficiency.

402
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,640
I sent an email to their public mailbox last weekend. But there's no reply even now.

403
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,280
That's odd.

404
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,180
Director Yang told me that he would check the inbox every day.

405
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,380
Who's Director Yang?

406
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,900
Su Wei'an, if there's really a problem, just tell me.

407
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,260
I can help you solve it together.

408
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,320
No need. I can handle it myself.

409
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,620
By the way, how many more files to translate? Can you give them to me in one go?

410
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,340
I still need to take care of my aunt. I don't have that much time to keep working for you.

411
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,420
Still a lot to come. I'll tell you when I sort them out.

412
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,420
Yuncheng?

413
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,845
Yuncheng?

414
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:23,900
Are you here to pick me up?

415
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,660
Get in.

416
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,043
It's windy at night.

417
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,943
I'm so cold.

418
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,410
Did you take Su Wei'an's report?

419
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,520
You met me because of Su Wei'an again?

420
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,060
Just answer me yes or no.

421
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,460
Yes.

422
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,400
The Adverse Event Report she mailed was torn up by me.

423
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
What? She specially went to Jiehui to mail it?

424
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Or did you invite her to a certain exhibition?

425
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,980
I'm warning you. Stay away from Su Wei'an.

426
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,220
Even if she's going to ruin your project,

427
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,400
you're still trying to defend her?

428
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,660
That's between me and her. It has nothing to do with you.

429
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,400
And, do not come to Jiehui anymore.

430
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,160
We've broken up.

431
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,680
Don't pretend that you're still my girlfriend in front of my employees.

432
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,280
If I run into that, don't blame me for being rude.

433
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I'm busy now. I can't drive you home.

434
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,300
Yuncheng.

435
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Yuncheng!

436
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,360
You're home.

437
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,900
What happened?

438
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,880
Did anyone bully my baby girl?

439
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,880
What happened, Xiao Ran?

440
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,940
Dad, am I a fool?

441
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,820
Do I trust people too easily?

442
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,920
What exactly is going on?

443
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,080
Tell me.

444
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,800
Do you still remember my paper was wrongly accused, and my name was withdrawn from it?

445
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:44,260
That classmate was called Su Wei'an. She was later expelled.

446
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,800
A while ago, she approached me

447
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,590
and asked me to help her aunt take part in the HDQ39 clinical trial.

448
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,440
Haven't I told you already? That is a serious matter.

449
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,820
The admission is all random. You can't interfere.

450
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,400
Yeah. That's what I told her.

451
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,900
But I don't know what has got into her.

452
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,760
She has spread rumors that HDQ39 has side effects.

453
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,820
I think she's trying to get back at me.

454
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,400
Xiao Ran, what exactly did she say?

455
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,958
If there's truly an adverse event, I want to talk to her in person.

456
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,280
No need, Dad.

457
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,580
She's just dark-minded. She just hates to see me happy.

458
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,000
You know what?

459
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,370
Back at school, she had a crush on Yuncheng.

460
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:38,990
Now she knows that I'm his girlfriend, she becomes jealous of me.

461
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,060
Lately, she keeps badgering Yuncheng.

462
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,560
Yuncheng ignores her, but she just won't give up.

463
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,540
She just has to break us up.

464
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,160
How can this girl be so shameless?

465
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Yeah.

466
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,580
Dad, if she ever comes to bother you, you mustn't talk to her.

467
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,680
I see.

468
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,300
All right, stop being upset now.

469
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,080
Go take a shower and go to bed.

470
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,240
Su Wei'an.

471
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,280
Hi, Eliot.

472
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,260
 Gu, the literature and files you asked me to look for, I've told my assistant to send them to your mailbox.

473
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,800
That's great, Eliot. Thank you.

474
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,160
You did me a great favor this time.

475
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,840
What you told me to look for are the most cutting-edge gene editing technologies.

476
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,520
Will this help your research on gliomas?

477
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,540
I have my reasons.

478
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,220
How about this? I'll treat you to dinner before you go back home.

479
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,860
Bye.

480
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,240

481
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,680

482
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,640
These are the remaining files to be translated.

483
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,400
When you finish them, your work is done.

484
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,000
Where did you get so much French literature?

485
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,080
Take your time. I'm in no hurry.

486
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,440
Be careful when you're translating. You'll have to redo it if you mistranslate any.

487
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,280
That'll be a huge waste of time.

488
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,620
No worries. I'll definitely complete the mission with due quality and quantity.

489
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,260
No redoing.

490
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,520
This is too much.

491
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:10,710

492
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,000
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

493
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,160
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

494
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,840
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

495
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:28,060
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

496
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,920
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:42,760
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

499
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:50,040
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

500
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,180
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

501
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,160
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

502
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,360
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

503
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,400
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

504
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,880
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫
