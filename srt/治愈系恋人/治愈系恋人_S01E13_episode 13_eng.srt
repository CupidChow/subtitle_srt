 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,130
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,800
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,440
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,080
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,060

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,980

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,080
Yunzheng, I heard that you once performed a surgery with a gun to your head, is that right?

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,540
You even heard about that?

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,700
The person with the gun to my head is General Kouyate.

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,840
When he heard I was returning to attend your birthday party,

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,680
chased me to the airport just to give me this, his gift for you.

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,860
he chased me to the airport just to give me this, his gift for you.

22
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,040
It's a pocket watch made in Germany during World War II.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,000
I've checked it already, and it's very accurate.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,280
It's just like you, growing stronger with age.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,980
Good stuff.

26
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,580
Yunzheng, you know me so well.

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,580
General Kouyate specifically asked the president to give me this.

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,500
The Medal of Independence.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,480
Just to thank me for saving his life.

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,660
Dad, there are some urgent matters at the company.

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,020
Is it so important that you have to go?

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,060
Can't you just ask someone else to take care of it?

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,400
Yuncheng, today is Grandpa's birthday.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,700
No matter how urgent it is, it can wait.

35
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,360
How about you wait until you finish eating Grandpa's birthday cake?

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,480
It's okay. If the young people are busy, just let them go first.

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,100
I have Yunzheng here.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
You can go.

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,180
Jiang Jiang.

40
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,530
Why are you here?

41
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,300
It's so late. Where'd you go?

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,020
I've been waiting for you all night, where have you been?

43
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,780
- I'm asking you. 
 - No, I'm asking you.

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,460
I just came back, so I went to see people's nightlife. Can't I?

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,260
Really?

46
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,340
When did you come back?

47
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,560
You're not there.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm by myself, so what's the point of me staying in that place?

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,260
So I came back.

50
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,080
But isn't Fang Mingfan still there?

51
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,790
How far have you two progressed?

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,820
I've succeeded.

53
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,000
Really? That's great.

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,060
You've dragged this process on so long.

55
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,860
What? He always wants me to be responsible for him, you know?

56
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,000
He's a grown man. What can I do for him?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,620
But I just went with the flow and won him over.

58
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,600
That's great.

59
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,580
So he's back too?

60
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes, he is.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,840
Okay, don't leave tonight. I'll sleep with you in my arms.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,460
I wasn't planning to leave tonight.

63
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,300
It's too early.

64
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,160
In the end, I went from Lakaya to Jinhai.

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,080
What? What Lakaya?

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,360
What did you say?

67
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,640
Sister Lan, good morning. You're up so early.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,340
Shakespeare. We were just saying,

69
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,620
I mean, next to Paris VI University, there's a Shakespeare bookstore.

70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,540
And we often go there for coffee.

71
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,560
- Right. 
 - And to read some books.

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,760
Really?

73
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,380
Tell me, when you were reading, were there any foreign boys pursuing her?

74
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,200
She's too embarrassed to tell me.

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,040
If I find out that you're not serious about dating, I'll skin you.

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,360
- Yes. 
 - Really?

77
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,440
And there's quite a lot.

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Really? Come on, hurry up. Let’s talk about it.

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,320
Wei'an just wouldn't tell me.

80
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,860
Tell me, what kind of person is he?

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,480
It's a Frenchman. His name is Eliot.

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,980
He's a famous French doctor.

83
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,040
You have no idea, those eyes of his are deep and charming.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,160
After you see him, your soul will be hooked away.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,840
So handsome? French people are good.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,800
They are romantic and sentimental.

87
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,920
But Auntie, he's a bit too romantic.

88
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,360
When we went to a dance, he pulled over a girl and kissed her right away.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
And he almost kissed me.

90
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,040
I was so scared that I quickly grabbed Wei'an and ran.

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
That's not good. We can't accept that.

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,260
No matter how handsome he is, he's not good.

93
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,880
You're right.

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Help me think.

95
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,640
Did anyone give her a stone?

96
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,020
A stone?

97
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,520
It's like... Wait, I'll show you.

98
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,170
It's this. Take a look.

99
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,095
This...

100
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,020
Do you know?

101
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,060
Let me think.

102
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,660
We went mountain climbing.

103
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,520
On the mountain, there was a large wishing pool.

104
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,760
This was picked up from the wishing pool.

105
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,020
Picked up? It was picked up?

106
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,840
Yes, I remember. This one is for attracting peach blossoms. 
  (TN: For lovers)

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,040
It's for lovers?

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,720
But why did Wei'an say it's for attracting wealth?

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,720
Auntie, she's embarrassed to tell you.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
She must be afraid that she won't be able to attract a peach blossom, and then you'll scold her.

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Really? Attracting peach blossoms are good.

112
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,920
I almost threw it away accidentally.

113
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I need to find a good place for it.

114
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,980
I'll put it here. Next to the first place trophy.

115
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,440
Okay.

116
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,940
Please help my daughter find a good man.

117
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,340
Help me think about it again.

118
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,960
Is there anyone named Yun or Zheng?

119
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,260
Mom, why are you asking her this?

120
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,333
Is the food ready? I'm starving.

121
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,580
No, there's plenty of food in the kitchen. Go find some yourself.

122
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,820
How would I know if I didn't ask? We're caring about you.

123
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,500
If you try hard on your own, would we have to worry about you here?

124
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,800
- Right? 
 - Exactly.

125
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,440
Look. Think about it for me, is there someone named Yun or...?

126
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,400
Auntie, the one you're talking about is Du Yuncheng.

127
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,480
It does seem a bit like this name.

128
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,590
Yes, it must be him. He's Wei'an's senior in college.

129
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,750
Also, back in school, he confessed his love to her in public.

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,160
He did?

131
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,660
And then?

132
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,240
By the way, Wei'an, didn’t you say that he's now the CEO of some Jiehui?

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,280
What's going on?

134
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,770
He's even a CEO?

135
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,040
No wonder he's a CEO. He has good taste.

136
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,840
He chose our Wei'an among all the people.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,380
He already has a girlfriend.

138
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,280
He has a girlfriend?

139
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:54,540
That's not right.

140
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,940
If he has a girlfriend, why do you call his name in your dreams?

141
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,120
Call what name?

142
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,840
No way. I only met him once after I came back.

143
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,900
But I heard it myself.

144
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,460
It was so clear.

145
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,500
Yuncheng.

146
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,940
Mom!

147
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,400
Square dance.

148
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
I'm late.

149
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,540
I've already prepared the food. Help yourselves.

150
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,580
Hurry up and go.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,560
Tell me when I come back.

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,860
Scared me to death.

153
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
I was wrong.

154
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,920

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,040

156
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,360
 She left?

157
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,080
 Where did she go?

158
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,460
 Where did she go?

159
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,160
 Where did she go?

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,600
 How do I know where she's going?

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,000
Boss.

162
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,680
What are you thinking about?

163
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,880
Mind your own business.

164
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,200
I know even if you don’t tell me. Follow me.

165
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Where to?

166
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,940
The psychiatric department.

167
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,700
You should know.

168
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,920
After the medical aid team returns, they all have to take a mental health test.

169
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,240
I heard they hired a very good doctor from Harvard Medical School.

170
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,880
Just in time to also take a look at your other psychological problems.

171
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,400
Let's go.

172
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,220
Dr. Gu.

173
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,080
What a coincidence.

174
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,640
I thought you weren't coming back this year.

175
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,900
From Dr. He's tone, it doesn't seem like you didn't want me to come back.

176
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,360
How could that be?

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,115
I miss you very much.

178
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:53,780
Without you here, I have one less competitor.

179
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,420
Life is tasteless.

180
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,540
It seems like I've been away from China for too long.

181
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,000
I don’t even know when Dr. He became so confident.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,060
When did you qualify to be my competitor?

183
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,840
Things are different now, don't you know?

184
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,060
The selections for the Young Talent Fund will start soon.

185
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,866
No matter what president or chief you saved in Lakaya, or what medal you got,

186
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:23,100
it's no use.

187
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,440
What this selection relies on is scientific research ability.

188
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,520
Look at how much time you've wasted in Lakaya.

189
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,220
And I've been constantly making progress here.

190
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,500
So this time, I won't lose to you.

191
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,865
Goodbye.

192
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,840
So irritating.

193
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,380
Boss, just ignore him.

194
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,000
This guy is out of his mind.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,220
Why would I care about him?

196
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,200
He's someone who just idles his time away.

197
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,400
No wonder, even though I've been away for so long, I've never seen any of his papers published in the SCI  (Science Citation Index) .

198
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,780
Right. Just ignore him.

199
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,940
Come with me.

200
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,720
- Let's go. 
 - I said I don't want to go.

201
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,420
You'll see when you get there.

202
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,120
Here we are.

203
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
Right here.

204
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,165
Dr. Gu, are you guys here for a mental health test?

205
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,120
Yes.

206
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,660
Then have a seat over there first.

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,380
You're still so popular, even after being away.

208
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,820
- Thanks. 
 - Did you two both go on the medical aid mission to Lakaya?

209
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,480
- Yes. 
 - How long have you been back?

210
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,520
We just came back two weeks ago.

211
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,780
Then you two can drink some water and wait here.

212
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,460
Professor Li has already been notified.

213
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,040
Okay.

214
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,720
The environment here is really a lot better.

215
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,420
This chair is more comfortable than the beds in our lounge.

216
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,360
Boss, how much higher do you think the salary is for this female doctor from Harvard compared to ours?

217
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,580
This looks very luxurious.

218
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,400
Being in the International Department, it must be at one's own expense.

219
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,460
If you ask me, mental illness is a disease of the rich.

220
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,600
Boss, you really have to check it out later.

221
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,080
Fang Mingfan, can you please shut up?

222
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,780
Hello, you two. I'm Li Wantong.

223
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,840
Hello.

224
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,480
You're that female doctor who came back from Harvard Medical School?

225
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,460
Yes.

226
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,280
I joined Huaren Hospital not long ago. Please take good care of me.

227
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Dr. Gu Yunzheng. I read your paper on glioma in The Lancet. 
  (TN: A medical journal)

228
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,620
I've long admired you.

229
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,320
You have a Ph.D. in psychology, but you read a thesis on glioma? 
  (A growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord.)

230
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,000
Psychology is also an important branch of medicine.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,880
As a doctor, it's necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of cutting-edge research in various disciplines.

232
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,560
All right. Then let's go over there, gentlemen.

233
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,280
Let's go, Boss.

234
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,180
Has Dr. Gu encountered any setbacks recently?

235
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,540
I mean, in the emotional aspect.

236
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,680
No.

237
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
Besides a slightly elevated anxiety index

238
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,160
and a short-term sensitivity to interpersonal relationships,

239
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,300
the scores for the other items are all excellent.

240
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,400
So did I pass the test?

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Your mental health is good and your ability to handle stress is strong.

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,280
As for short-term mood swings, I think you can make adjustments yourself.

243
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,700
Thank you, Dr. Li. I'll go back to my office then.

244
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,500
Wait a minute.

245
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,240
Is there something else?

246
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,060
The Psychiatry Department, in addition to operating externally, also provides free psychological consultations for our hospital's doctors.

247
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,800
I think maybe one day, you will need this service.

248
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,240
- So... 
 - So I want to apologize to you in advance.

249
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,360
If that day really comes, I may not be able to consult you personally.

250
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,620
Why?

251
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,180
Because there can't be any emotional relationship between the counselor and the patient.

252
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,120
And I'm sure we're about to get into a relationship.

253
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,660
Dr. Li, it hasn't been more than 30 minutes since we met.

254
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm pretty sure we won't be getting into an emotional relationship.

255
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,300
But, I've known you for more than 30 minutes.

256
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,620
Before I met you, I screened the profiles of all single male doctors in the hospital system.

257
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,720
Whether it's height, weight, blood sugar, blood lipids, blood pressure,

258
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,880
or this 90-point symptom list, along with the mental health self-assessment form, resume, and personal experience,

259
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,300
you rank in the top three across the board.

260
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,580
And when I saw you just now, my pulse quickened to 27 beats faster.

261
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,828
So I'm very sure you are a perfect match for me, a high-quality man.

262
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,140
Dr. Li, I think the person who should really go to psychotherapy is you.

263
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,680
Boss, what took you so long?

264
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,440
What happened? Did she tell you the results?

265
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,080
Sick.

266
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,943
What? Wait, really?

267
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,540
What kind of illness?

268
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,400
Depression?

269
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,060
Su Wei'an made you depressed? Are you serious?

270
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,200
It's not PTSD caused by Interpreter Su's abandonment, right? 
  (TN: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)

271
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,640
- Don't scare me. 
 - Shut up.

272
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,530

273
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,580

274
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,080
Jiang Jiang, let's go.

275
00:16:53,376 --> 00:16:54,876
Look.

276
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,340
- Flattie? 
 - Yes.

277
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,440
Hello, your cat has been bathed.

278
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,820
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

279
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,180
Flattie. It really is you.

280
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,620
Of course, it is.

281
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,540
Long time no see.

282
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,220
You're still so flat.

283
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,360
How did you get it back here?

284
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,480
I looked into several shipping companies.

285
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,400
I also asked Dr. Seck to handle a lot of quarantine documents.

286
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,600
And then going from car to plane and plane to car, it took a lot of time.

287
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,280
It took me so much effort.

288
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
It was that troublesome?

289
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,140
Then why did you still want to get it back?

290
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,900
Because I promised you.

291
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,460
Jiang Jiang, I'll try my best to do whatever I promise you.

292
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,020
You're pretty caring, Fang Mingfan.

293
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,060
Then the beautiful Miss Jiang, are you free to have dinner with me tonight?

294
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,420
I have an appointment tonight.

295
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,800
An appointment?

296
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Yes.

297
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,300
With who?

298
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,340
My parents.

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,660
They asked me to go have dinner with a neighbor who came back from America.

300
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,340
All right.

301
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,260
Then I have to work overtime alone again tonight.

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,430
Be good, I'll accompany you next time.

303
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,740
It’s a deal.

304
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,660
Hello, Boss.

305
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,960
Didn't you ask Jiang Muying out for dinner tonight?

306
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,040
Forget it, she has an appointment.

307
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Looks like my weekend is destined to be spent in the duty room.

308
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,402
She has an appointment?

309
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:47,902
Yes.

310
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,620
With a man or woman?

311
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,040
You think it's the pretty Interpreter Su?

312
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,340
Boss, just stop thinking about her.

313
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,100
She's so determined to cut off contact with you.

314
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,580
She blocked your phone number and blacklisted you on WeChat.

315
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,260
Isn't it obvious that she already rejected you?

316
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,860
But I'm still worried.

317
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,680
Do you think something happened to her?

318
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,500
What could happen to a grown person like her?

319
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,660
And we live in an information society now.

320
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,480
If you can't explain it clearly through WeChat, just do it through a phone call.

321
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,960
Boss, have you ever thought that a person's disappearance is not an ellipsis? 
  (TN: Not temporary)

322
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,020
It's a period. 
  (TN: It's permanent)

323
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,460
No matter what era we're in, even if she wants to end things with me, she should tell me in person.

324
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,500
If you don't get sad after being dumped, you'll become mad.

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,580
The best way to fix broken love is to move on and find another love.

326
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,200
I think that Dr. Li is quite good.

327
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,500
She's quite beautiful.

328
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,720
And she's as amazingly good as you.

329
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,140
I think she's the best-looking female doctor.

330
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,700
She's that excellent?

331
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,180
Then you might as well give up on Jiang Muying and go chase after Dr. Li.

332
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,720
There's no need to hurt each other.

333
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,640
I mean, she's the most beautiful girl besides Jiang Jiang.

334
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,560
Don't get me wrong.

335
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,420
 Look how time flies. We haven't seen each other for so long.

336
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,140
That's right.

337
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,520
- It's been quite long. 
 - You know...

338
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,200
Xiao Ying. Come, come in.

339
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,300
- This is Xiao Ying? 
 - Yes.

340
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,220
Look how fast time passes.

341
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,980
In the blink of an eye, she has grown into a big girl.

342
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,580
She was so little back then.

343
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,920
Look at how slim and graceful she is now.

344
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,360
Hello, Auntie. Hello, Uncle.

345
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,380
When you went to America, our Xiao Ying wasn't even in elementary school yet.

346
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right.

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,300
Xiao Ying, do you still remember Uncle Yan and Auntie Fang?

348
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,300
When you were little, Auntie Fang even held you.

349
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,280
Time really flies.

350
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,920
 It was more than 20 years ago. How can I remember?

351
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,760
 If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have come to this awkward gathering of middle-aged and elderly people.

352
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,960
 It would've been better to go to dinner with Dr. Fang.

353
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
Look, why isn't Xiao Kai here yet?

354
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,940
You're right. Look at this kid, he has no sense of time.

355
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,920
Don't worry, we'll wait for him.

356
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,020
Xiao Kai just returned to China. Is he settling in well?

357
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,520
What's he doing now?

358
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,420
He returned to China this time because he got an offer from a well-known game company.

359
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,360
I see.

360
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,640
He's the marketing director.

361
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,920
And he's usually very busy.

362
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,760
I don't think we should wait anymore. Let's just eat while waiting.

363
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,640
Xiao Ying must be hungry.

364
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,240
Xiao Ying, have some more meat. You're too skinny.

365
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,680
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - Eat more.

366
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,960
I remember Xiao Kai's grades were already very good when he was young.

367
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
And he's become successful after growing up.

368
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Game companies pay well, right?

369
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,320
Their company pays an annual salary.

370
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I think it's average.

371
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,080
 Did you come all the way back from America just to show off your child?

372
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,520
 I really shouldn't have come to this dinner.

373
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,840
Xiao Kai is just three years older than Xiao Ying, right?

374
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,440
Yes, just three years older.

375
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,100
The two of them must have something in common.

376
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,440
 What's going on here?

377
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,220
 They're not setting up a blind date for me, are they?

378
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,480
 With my dating skills, do I even need a blind date?

379
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,740
 I've grown up and accomplished nothing.

380
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,500
 Isn’t that because I've only been focused on dating?

381
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,720
 Who are you looking down on?

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,420
Xiao Ying, which university did you go to?

383
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,820
What was your major?

384
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,540
Xiao Ying studied medicine.

385
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,820
That's very good.

386
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,880
Auntie Fang, I went to university in Jinhai.

387
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,400
I studied veterinary medicine.

388
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,140
Very good, very good.

389
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,260
Then where are you working now?

390
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,720
Her previous job was too tiring.

391
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,040
She wants to take a break for now.

392
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,540
It's not easy to find a job in my field.

393
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,660
If it's too difficult, I can't do it.

394
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
And if it's too tiring, I don’t want to do it.

395
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,140
So for now, I'm just staying at home.

396
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,800
I think it's also good for a girl to take care of the family.

397
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,180
Men are responsible for making money and supporting the family, and women are responsible for looking beautiful.

398
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,860
Yes. Yes, you're absolutely right.

399
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,380
Our Xiao Ying has just been too well-protected by her father and I.

400
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,900
She can't bear any hardships at all.

401
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,980
She just wants to find someone who will love and cherish her.

402
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,360
I think Xiao Kai is quite suitable.

403
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,580
- I think so, too. 
 - Mom.

404
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,300
How do you know he's suitable?

405
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,590
Have you ever met him?

406
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,860
- Aren't we meeting him now? 
 - That's right.

407
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,080
- Aren't we meeting him now? 
 - That's right.

408
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,740
Uncle and Auntie, I'm full now. Please take your time and enjoy the meal.

409
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,300
Wait, Xiao Ying.

410
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,140
Hello, I'm Yan Kai.

411
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,160
You can call me Kevin.

412
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,777
Hello.

413
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,200
I saw these flowers downstairs just now. They're beautiful.

414
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,860
I remember that you liked flowers since you were little, so I bought them for you.

415
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,060
Thank you.

416
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,400
Brother Xiao Kai.

417
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,500
You even remember that I like flowers?

418
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,940
Of course.

419
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,240
I remember you visiting my house when we were little.

420
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,920
You loved my dad's Chinese rose.

421
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,040
So you just took it off and put it on your head.

422
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,860
When my dad came back and saw the bare branches, he thought I did it.

423
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,240
And he gave me a beating.

424
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,660
True, that did happen.

425
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,680
Really? I don't really remember.

426
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,560
Then do you remember when we were little, you bought a popsicle and let me take a bite?

427
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,280
I bit off almost half of it in one bite.

428
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,800
And then you ran back crying and complained to our parents.

429
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,380
- I remember this. 
 - Xiao Ying cried so hard back then.

430
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,660
I thought she was being bullied outside.

431
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,530
I didn't expect it to be just because of a popsicle.

432
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,640
I think I have a vague memory of this.

433
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,800
I think you young people should just add each other on WeChat.

434
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
It'll be easier to keep in touch in the future, right?

435
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,240
Yes, add each other on WeChat, Xiao Kai.

436
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,240
Xiao Ying, can I add you on WeChat?

437
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
There's an Andy Warhol exhibition this weekend.

438
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
I happen to have tickets and can take you with me.

439
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,870
Of course. Why not?

440
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,740
Our Xiao Ying loves watching fashion shows.

441
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,320
Xiao Ying, add Brother Xiao Kai on WeChat.

442
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,020

443
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,720
I'm sorry for troubling you, Professor Wang.

444
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,540
You're too polite, Professor Gu.

445
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,820
It's not a big deal to check a student's records to find their home address.

446
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,260
I won't tell anyone else.

447
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:32,500
However, many students' current addresses are different from the ones they provided back then.

448
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,580
So I can't guarantee that you'll find the person.

449
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,160
That's okay.

450
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,660
As long as there is something.

451
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,720
 This is the first time I've taken a shortcut in my life. Just to find you.

452
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,020
 Su Wei'an. Are you satisfied now?

453
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,800
I found it.

454
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Su Wei'an?

455
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,600

456
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,720
How come it's her?

457
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,300
What, Professor Wang?

458
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,720
Do you have an impression of her?

459
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Of course, I do.

460
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,160
Back then, when she came to me to drop out of school, something was off.

461
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,520
What was off?

462
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,180
 Student Su, your grades are excellent.

463
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,120
 Why do you want to drop out?

464
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,260
 If it's financial difficulties, the school has many scholarships and financial aid programs.

465
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,640
 If you need it, I can help you apply.

466
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,800
 Professor Wang, it's not about money.

467
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
 Then what's the reason?

468
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,440
 Your academic performance, papers, and other scores are all outstanding.

469
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,340
 Once you graduate and enter Huaren, there's no doubt that you'll become an excellent doctor.

470
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,520
 But I can't wait any longer.

471
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,240
 If I can't hold a scalpel in the future, there's no point in going on with my studies.

472
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,860
It's a pity.

473
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,150
She can't hold a scalpel?

474
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,100

475
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,085
 Boss, have you ever thought that in this day and age, a person's disappearance isn't temporary?

476
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:37,640
 It's permanent.

477
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,460

478
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,560
 Navigating to Jiayuan Apartments.

479
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,380
 Turn left 100 meters ahead. (328 feet)

480
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,900
 Enter Jinxi South Road.

481
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,280
Time to eat.

482
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,800
Let's eat.

483
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,800
Hello, Senior.

484
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,309
Really?

485
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,860
That's great!

486
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,685
I don’t even know how to thank you.

487
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:28,500
Yes, I still live here.

488
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,585
No problem.

489
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:33,435
Let's do this then. Come pick me up, I'll treat you to a big meal.

490
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,555
All right, see you later.

491
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,500
Mom, Auntie can participate in the clinical trial.

492
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,340
Really? That's great.

493
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,480
I'll call A'Yuan right now.

494
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,940
This is great.

495
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,540
A'Yuan.

496
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,740
- I'm going out for a bit. 
 - What are you doing?

497
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,780
He did me a big favor, so I have to treat him to a big meal.

498
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,180
Is it that senior you mentioned? Du Yun...

499
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,040
You don't know him.

500
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,200
I'm leaving.

501
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,100

502
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,320
Thank you, Senior. You really did me a big favor.

503
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,780
I went to Zhang He Hospital today and happened to hear Director Yang mention it.

504
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,200
I wanted to tell you the good news right away.

505
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,620
Take this back with you and have a look.

506
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:30,540
Director Yang will call you later to personally explain and sign this document.

507
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,320
Senior, you really did me a big favor this time.

508
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,660
You don't have to thank me.

509
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,700
You were lucky and someone voluntarily quit.

510
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,940
So Ms. Su Yuan can just fill their spot.

511
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,800
Then you are my lucky star.

512
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,220
Or, you're a messenger pigeon that brings good news.

513
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,380
The pigeon is tired from flying, so what good food do you want to treat me to?

514
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,040
Tell me, I'll give it my best shot today.

515
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,900
Black Pearl, Michelin, whatever you choose.

516
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,980
Eat where?

517
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,700
Go home and eat. I've already made dinner.

518
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,740
Mom.

519
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,160
This is Du Yuncheng, right?

520
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
This is my mom.

521
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,920
Hello, Auntie. I'm Du Yuncheng, Wei'an's senior at university.

522
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,600
Hello, Senior. Seniors are the most reliable.

523
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,180
Even more so if he doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

524
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,300
No.

525
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,820
I mean, Wei'an always told me that she has a reliable senior.

526
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,220
I didn't expect to meet you today.

527
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,310
-  Su Wei'an. 
 - Let's go. Auntie made a lot of delicious food.

528
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,320
-  Is this why you disappeared? 
 - Come.

529
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,860
Let's go home and eat.

530
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,280
Don't be shy. Come, let's go.

531
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,580
I still have so much to say to you.

532
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,660
 Could it all have been my imagination?

533
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,900
 I've been making a fool of myself all along.

534
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,160
 If you lose, you have to admit it.

535
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,140
 I'm willing to lose to you.

536
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,520
If this isn't love,

537
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,140
then do I... really know her at all?

538
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,540
 I can't be a deserter.

539
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,160
 I have to clear things up no matter what.

540
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,680
 Even if it's over, it must have a proper closure.

541
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,200
What's the matter?

542
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
 Boss.

543
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,020
 A 45-year-old male patient with an intracranial mass needs urgent medical attention.

544
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,040
 The CT scan shows the intracranial mass, hemorrhage, and transtentorial herniation.

545
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,060
The patient is unconscious and has a heart rate of 48 beats per minute.

546
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,240
His blood oxygen level is 75%.

547
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,120
A cerebral herniation patient? Immediately administer mannitol to reduce the pressure,

548
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,905
and stabilize the patient's vital signs.

549
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,297
Prepare for surgery.

550
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,100
We'll operate immediately in half an hour.

551
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,220
Auntie is so good at cooking.

552
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm going to become pickier from now on.

553
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,120
What's wrong, Wei'an?

554
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,140
Nothing. What did you just say?

555
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,840
I said, Auntie's cooking is so delicious.

556
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,940
If you ever want to eat it again, just let me know.

557
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,600
I'll ask my mom to cook for you.

558
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,092
Okay, then I'll leave first.

559
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:02,037
Be safe.

560
00:34:02,037 --> 00:34:04,157
Thank you, Senior.

561
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,700
 What am I thinking?

562
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,540
 There's no way Gu Yunzheng could've come here.

563
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,640

564
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,500

565
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,940
Large, high-grade hemispheric glioma.

566
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,200
Necrosis due to ischemia in the tumor's center.

567
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,840
Rupture of newly formed blood vessels.

568
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,920
Severe bleeding led to brain herniation.

569
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,400
The tumor has been exposed.

570
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,635
Now, gradually separate the tumor along its border.

571
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:41,664
Make sure to observe whether the tumor is wrapped around or adhered to the surrounding blood vessels and nerves.

572
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:42,980
The tumor is tough.

573
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,300
We can use an ultrasonic scalpel to break it down.

574
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,100
Then we can use a suction device to clean it up.

575
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,705
You've got a solid grasp of the theoretical knowledge.

576
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:53,830
Now, you can do the rest of the tumor dissection.

577
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
But we don't know what's beneath the tumor.

578
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,120
I'm afraid that...

579
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,980
Dr. Gu.

580
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,320
As you gradually dissect the tumor, the situation beneath it will gradually be exposed.

581
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,680
As long as you're careful with this step, there won't be any problems later on.

582
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,400
Boss, just scold me like you used to.

583
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,860
I'll feel a bit better if you scold me.

584
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:44,360
You want me to scold you so you can achieve psychological balance.

585
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,800
But I just don't want you to feel better.

586
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,780
I can't always make it back in time.

588
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:57,740
For emergency patients, time is life.

589
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
I'm not the one you should be apologizing to.

590
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,580
At that time, I...

591
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,180
Fang Mingfan.

592
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,962
What exactly are your plans?

593
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,312
How much longer will you avoid it?

594
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,920
You know what I'm talking about.

595
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,040
It's been two years already.

596
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,740
When are you planning to do your next surgery?

597
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
Right, I just remembered.

598
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
Director Wang asked me to get a report from the lab.

599
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,420
Stop right there.

600
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:32,831
Come back.

601
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
Boss, please give me a bit more time.

602
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,720
For every operation, you've prepared detailed surgical plans.

603
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,080
With two years of continuous practice, you've developed muscle memory.

604
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,280
If it's still PTSD from the last operation,

605
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,340
I suggest you go to the Psychiatry Department now for systematic desensitization.

606
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,400
I have nothing more to teach you.

607
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,000
If your fear of failure outweighs your desire to save patients,

608
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,760
then I hope you reconsider and think carefully about whether you really want to be a surgeon.

609
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,680

610
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,780

611
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,020

612
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,840

613
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,830
Blocking doesn't mean deleting.

614
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,280
Why can't I even see his Moments?

615
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,200
What are you thinking?

616
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,520
What are you thinking? You're not sleeping yet?

617
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,590
To be honest, that senior of yours is great.

618
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,070
He's handsome and warm-hearted.

619
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,690
But most importantly, he cares about you and your matters.

620
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,930
Mom, our relationship is purely that of a senior and junior.

621
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,190
Mom, our relationship is purely that of a senior and junior.

622
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,030
We've stayed up all night working on research papers together.

623
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,330
That's all.

624
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,030
I know he has a girlfriend.

625
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,430
But look at how young people are dating now, right?

626
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,630
Maybe, what if...

627
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,630
So you still have a chance.

628
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,550
He's not my ideal type at all.

629
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,430
What's your ideal type then?

630
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,800
I'm not telling you.

631
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,150
- One, two, three. 
 - Fine.

632
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,330
- One, two, three. 
 - Fine.

633
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:50,630
Hurry up and tell me.

634
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,170
My ideal type...

635
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,215
is probably a doctor.

636
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:02,235
 He saves lives without hesitation.

637
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,810
Sometimes, he's a bit fierce.

638
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,730
 Su Wei'an, if I catch you providing treatment without permission again,

639
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,600
  I will cooperate with the police to bring you to justice.

640
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,950
But that's also because he strives for excellence in medicine.

641
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,330
 And in private, he's like a child, always preparing some unexpected little surprises.

642
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:24,870
 And in private, he's like a child, always preparing some unexpected little surprises.

643
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:29,970
 I'm returning it to its original owner. From now on, don't lose it anymore.

644
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,558
He's a very sensible person,

645
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:37,993
but when he gets jealous, he becomes a different man.

646
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:41,385
 Dr. Xu performed the surgery for you. How will you show gratitude to him?

647
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:44,190
 I promised to translate two papers for him.

648
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,690
 Is this banner only for me?

649
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,959
Sometimes, I really want to get angry at him.

650
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:55,079
 But as soon as I see his handsome face,

651
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,220
I can’t get mad at him anymore.

652
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:09,760
I want to watch the stars and the moon with him.

653
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,845
 Orion. Draco. Cassiopeia!

654
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,460
 Gemini. Auriga.

655
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,520
And see all the beautiful things in this world.

656
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,285
Wake up.

657
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:35,110
Little girls like you deserve to be single for life.

658
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,755
The kind of perfect man you described only exists in TV dramas.

659
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:41,000
You can't find one in real life.

660
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:46,346
And even if you do, why would he fall for you?

661
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,211
You've simply watched too many TV dramas.

662
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,796
Yes, you're right.

663
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:55,300
Don't talk about me and my senior again. It’s really impossible for us.

664
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,825
Why?

665
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:59,390
Tell me, what's wrong with your senior?

666
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,926
He's perfect in every way. It's me. I don't deserve him, okay?

667
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,726
That's true.

668
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,250
That's enough, get out of here.

669
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,230
- I need to do some research. 
 - You're kicking me out again.

670
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,190
Look, I didn't even tell you the important stuff.

671
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,270
About your aunt,

672
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,620
the clinical trial spot issue has been settled.

673
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
But there's a long way to go.

674
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,140
Also, your aunt is a strong-willed person.

675
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,890
Do you think she can get through this?

676
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,690
It will indeed be a lengthy battle.

677
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,990
How about this?

678
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:40,050
I'll find a good psychologist in China to offer Auntie regular psychological counseling.

679
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,030
A psychologist? Is it that serious?

680
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,710
Mom, psychotherapy is a very common way to help people nowadays.

681
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,990
You cannot be biased.

682
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:55,330
And for chorea patients, it's important to maintain a healthy and good mindset.

683
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,650
Right.

684
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,900
Okay, then find a good one for her.

685
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,990
Go to bed soon.

686
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,110
Don't stay up too late, okay?

687
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,080

688
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,250
Harvard Medical School, medical doctorate in psychiatry.

689
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,060
Outstanding young member of the American Psychiatric Association.

690
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,130
So beautiful.

691
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,110
So young.

692
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,630
This world is indeed unfair.

693
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:40,550
Some people are favored all throughout their lives.

694
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,900
Huaren Hospital International Department.

695
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,100
They're not in the same building.

696
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,670
I probably won’t run into Gu Yunzheng, right?

697
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:08,750

698
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,100
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen
