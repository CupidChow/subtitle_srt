 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,760
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,540
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,150
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,080

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,920
The party at the scene exposed three cases of ruptured aneurysms.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,660
Professor Wen Yuliang, who is in charge of research and development, couldn't convince the public at the conference.

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,900
President Du, I wonder if it is because you tried to hide it from us or because of mismanagement.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,360
Let me answer that for you.

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,840
Hello, board members. My name is Wen Ran.

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm now in charge of the HDQ39 project.

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,020
The Professor Wen Yuliang you just mentioned is my father.

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,260
I know his research better than anyone.

24
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,830
As far as I know, these three patients with ruptured aneurysms

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,020
had already signed voluntary withdrawal agreements before the ruptures occurred.

26
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,580
In clinical trials, these should be counted as natural dropouts.

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,320
Clearly, this situation is being used by someone with an agenda to deliberately discredit Jiehui and HDQ39.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,880
This also goes to show the project's unlimited potential.

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
We've taken someone else's share of the cake.

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,260
Regardless, we'll present a crisis management plan as soon as possible.

31
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,200
Don't think a crisis management plan will help you muddle through.

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I suspect there are serious flaws in HDQ39's research and development process,

33
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
and they have caught someone's eye.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,300
If similar adverse events happen again in the future,

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,580
this drug will surely be stopped by the Ethics Committee.

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,740
All the billions invested in the early stages will go down the drain.

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
That's just your speculation.

38
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,580
There's no evidence that the aneurysm ruptures are related to HDQ39.

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,780
Even if there are risks, our job is to do everything we can

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,780
to protect this project and make sure that it can be successfully launched.

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,720
It's an "orphan drug."

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,360
Even if it hits the market, how big can it get?

43
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,500
Given the current negative impact, I suggest

44
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,180
it's time to cut our losses.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,360
Listen, everyone.

46
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,740
Authoritative data shows China's rare disease drug market

47
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:47,460
is expected to exceed 10 billion US dollars in the next five to ten years.

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,360
This is a promising opportunity.

49
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,300
Our company, Jiehui, is among the first in the Chinese pharmaceutical industry to plan and strategize in this area.

50
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,100
HDQ39 will be the vanguard in the research of rare disease drugs.

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,820
Also, Maiteng Group's eagerness to acquire our shares proves this point.

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,480
When I first started this project, you all tried to block me in every possible way, just like now.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,560
You want me to cut losses now?

54
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
The money we'll lose...

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,380
Director Wang, should we deduct it from your bonus?

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,560
- You... 
 - Director Wang.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,370
Everyone, if HDQ39 launches successfully, it'll be good for everybody.

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,560
If it doesn't, someone must pay for this stubborn decision.

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,160
If it doesn't, someone must pay for this stubborn decision.

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,980
Yuncheng, those old men on the board only know how to make sarcastic comments.

61
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,210
Don't take it to heart.

62
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,940
Don't worry.

63
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,980
I'll do my best to help you produce results and shut them up.

64
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,540
Lots of people notice problems, but few solve them.

65
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,060
The latter is who Jiehui really needs.

66
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,400
Are you referring to me?

67
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,290
Xiao Ran, please step outside first.

68
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,379
Okay.

69
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,100
Senior.

70
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,060
Wei'an, why are you here?

71
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,860
My aunt's nursing home, how come it was you who arranged it?

72
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,720
Did you know your aunt has depression? Your mom worked very hard to take care of her.

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,720
It's not just doing daily chores like laundry and cooking. She also has to take care of her emotions.

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Caring for the sick is exhausting.

75
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,220
The nursing home must be expensive.

76
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,540
I'll transfer you the money.

77
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,940
Let's not bring up money between us. I told your mom not to tell you.

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,660
You're a person who relies on yourself.

79
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,560
If I told you, you'd have wanted to settle accounts. I don't want you to feel burdened.

80
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,200
But can you tell me why a video of my aunt appeared in Professor Wen's report?

81
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,100
Also, it was filmed at the nursing home.

82
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,700
A video? Hold on.

83
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Assistant Lin, come in, please.

84
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,500
President Du.

85
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,700
About the video taken of Wei'an's aunt at the nursing home, do you know about it?

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,620
This was what happened.

87
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,560
When Professor Wen was preparing for the Neurology Annual Conference, he needed supporting materials to show the clinical trial results.

88
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,260
I thought a video would be more persuasive, so I got Ms. Su Yuan's consent and sent a video of her to Professor Wen.

89
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,540
To protect her privacy, I pixelated her face.

90
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,580
For matters regarding Wei'an's aunt, why didn't you consult me first?

91
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,940
I thought with the face blurred, you wouldn't be able to tell who it is at all.

92
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,180
So I just...

93
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,197
I'm sorry, President Du. I didn't think this through carefully.

94
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:11,000
If you do something like this again, you'll be out of here immediately.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I understand.

96
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,780
I'm sorry, Wei'an. This was due to my poor management.

97
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,560
I'll personally apologize to your aunt another day.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,460
No need, Senior. Thank you for taking such good care of my family.

99
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,080
But we shouldn't trouble you anymore.

100
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,660
I'll find another nursing home as soon as possible and have my aunt move out.

101
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,100
Wei'an, I really want to do something for you.

102
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,260
We appreciate your kindness.

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,260
There's something

104
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,900
I must tell you.

105
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,560
The results of the experiment Gu Yunzheng and I did indicates that HDQ39 may be related to the occurence of aneurysms.

106
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,660
Tomorrow, I will go see Professor Wen.

107
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,760
I know you're under a lot of pressure in developing this project.

108
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,540
But I also remember you said if any adverse event occurs with the drug, you'll end it yourself.

109
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm sorry, Senior.

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,340
I hope even more than you do that this drug works.

111
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,320
But now, I have no choice but to make this decision.

112
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,420
Yuncheng, what was she doing at Jiehui?

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,045
She wants me to personally stop the development of HDQ39.

114
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,940
What?

115
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
What is she up to?

116
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,620
I've already left Huaren.

117
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,620
Why won't she leave us alone?

118
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,900
They've found preliminary evidence linking HDQ39 to aneurysms.

119
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,310
She should be going to see Professor Wen soon.

120
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,040
That's right.

121
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,160
My dad is so upright, he would definitely believe her nonsense and stop the trial.

122
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,720
Then all his years of hard work will be wasted.

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,480
No, Yuncheng, think of some way.

124
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,140
The country has policies favoring research of drugs for rare diseases.

125
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,480
I can get expedited approval.

126
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,820
After the drug launches, I'll collect additional data

127
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,520
on its efficacy and safety for evaluation.

128
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,680
Xiao Ran,

129
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,160
I need your help.

130
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,020
Xiao Ran, what's going on?

131
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,040
I spilled my orange juice, and it's all over my laptop.

132
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,140
You're so clumsy.

133
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,400
Dad, can I use your laptop? Mine won't start.

134
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,940
Sure.

135
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,160
But be careful.

136
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
All my work stuff is on there. Don't break it.

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,420
Got it.

138
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,780

139
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,100

140
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,380

141
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,040

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,660
Professor Wen.

143
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,560
Next Tuesday at 2 p.m., please come to the lecture hall.

144
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,360

145
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,620
Professor Wen, you already have an answer?

146
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,100
Let me see your experiment results.

147
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400

148
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,960
In the hypertension model, in mice with the Huntington's disease gene, the positivity rate for arterial aneurysms is over 4%.

149
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,620
You've won.

150
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Professor Wen, our purpose in doing this experiment  was never to determine who wins or loses, much less to negate HDQ39.

151
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,400
On the contrary, during the experiment, we discovered HDQ39's outstanding performance.

152
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,620
We hope you continue to refine it.

153
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,020
Don't worry, HDQ39 is like my child.

154
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,380
I'll give the public a satisfactory answer.

155
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,020
And Xiao Su, I had a prejudice against you before.

156
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,620
I'm sorry. Now, I sincerely apologize to you.

157
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,900
Please don't say that.

158
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:02,080
I should be the one apologizing to you. After seeing my aunt's video at the conference, I acted impulsively.

159
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,880
I'm sorry, Professor Wen. I didn't mean to offend you.

160
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,160
It's okay.

161
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,000
The rigor of science is meant to withstand questioning.

162
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,080
President Du of Jiehui gave me this video to include in the report as supporting evidence for the efficacy of HDQ39.

163
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,020
At that time, I hesitated whether to include it, wondering if it was inappropriate.

164
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,420
But in the end, to draw the audience, I still included it.

165
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,140
You say President Du of Jiehui gave it to you?

166
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,780
Yes.

167
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,260
What's wrong?

168
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,780
Nothing.

169
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,820

170
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,380
Wen Ran! Wen Ran, come here!

171
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,600
Dad.

172
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
I told you not to work at Jiehui.

173
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,500
Are you turning a deaf ear to my words?

174
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,840
If I don't work at Jiehui, where else can I work?

175
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,880
The punishment Huaren gave me means I'll never be able to work in a hospital again.

176
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,780
Besides Jiehui, what company would offer me a project manager position right from the start?

177
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,260
Xiao Ran, why are you so stubborn?

178
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,880
Du Yuncheng is using you.

179
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,520
Dad,

180
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,740
why can't you trust your daughter's abilities?

181
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,120
No matter where I go, I'm always a standout.

182
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,120
But in your eyes, everything I do is wrong.

183
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,700
You want to control everything I do.

184
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,040
Fine, then let me ask you, did you touch my computer?

185
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,700
What did you send to Du Yuncheng using my email?

186
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,280
I...

187
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,860
Dad, Yuncheng is also doing this for your own good.

188
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,740
You've been researching HDQ39 for so many years.

189
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,100
For less than 1% of adverse events, you're letting everyone's efforts go to waste.

190
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,240
Are you willing?

191
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,980
How did you let Du Yuncheng brainwash you like this?

192
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,020
Have you ever thought about it?

193
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,240
At this critical moment, if he's letting you into Jiehui, he must have a purpose, and it's not a simple one.

194
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,380
I worry he'll do whatever it takes to achieve his goal.

195
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,740
Yuncheng has his difficulties. He needs to make a profit.

196
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,620
If he can't get a new drug to market, he'll lose control of Jiehui.

197
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,780
I've seen with my own eyes how those old board members of the company exclude and ignore him.

198
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,380
He's really in a difficult situation.

199
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,120
Dad, I beg you, just trust me this once.

200
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,100
With Yuncheng's capabilities, he surely has a way to get HDQ39 to market.

201
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,380
Let me tell you clearly, won't let HDQ39 go to market.

202
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,140
It's a matter of principle, so it's not open for discussion.

203
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,460
I will terminate the trial.

204
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,140
Dad...

205
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,260
Let everyone know that the press conference will be moved up to tomorrow.

206
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,340
Notify Huaren Hospital's Xiao Gu and Xiao Su.

207
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,380
Dad, you've been my idol since childhood.

208
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,180
How can you lose to someone like Su Wei'an?

209
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,140
How can you do this?

210
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,140
Xiao Ran, scientific research isn't child's play.

211
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,920
My winning or losing, and Du Yuncheng's profits, none of it compares to the patients' safety and health.

212
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,440
You say I'm your idol, but would I teach you to behave and act like this?

213
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,620
Yuncheng, bad news.

214
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,380
My dad's going to hold a press conference.

215
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,260
He's going to terminate the trial tomorrow.

216
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,940
Dad, I beg you, don't hold the press conference.

217
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,980
Once you announce the termination of the trial, it'll all be over for Yuncheng.

218
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,940
You're still only thinking about Du Yuncheng now.

219
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,840
I don't know what he has fed you, making you even discard research ethics and the basic standards of being a human being.

220
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,520
Yes, it's all my fault.

221
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,500
As long as you don't end the trial,

222
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,140
I'll leave Jiehui and break up with Yuncheng.

223
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,020
I'll listen to you for everything.

224
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,760
Xiao Ran,

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm really disappointed in you.

226
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,680
What should I do?

227
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,330
Senior.

228
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,360
Make it short. I'm pressed for time.

229
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,880
This might take up some of your time then, President Du.

230
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,740
We have many questions for you.

231
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:25,900
For those three aneurysm patients, why did their voluntary withdrawal agreements all happen to be signed just before they became ill?

232
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:32,590
Even if they fell ill after withdrawing, it should still be truthfully reported to the Ethics Committee.

233
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,020
It's been months since this happened, but why haven't we seen any report from the Ethics Committee?

234
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,420
It's been months since this happened, but why haven't we seen any report from the Ethics Committee?

235
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,740
That's a matter for the research team.

236
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,500
Jiehui is only responsible for funding.

237
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,540
You can ask Professor Wen about it.

238
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,320
I've already spoken to Professor Wen.

239
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,400
I've always hoped that he would report the adverse events, but Yang Wenbin has been obstructing it all along.

240
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,000
Also, before the neurology conference, Professor Wen knew nothing about the conditions of the three aneurysm patients.

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,060
Someone's covering it up.

242
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,550
Senior,

243
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,440
did you bribe Yang Wenbin?

244
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,920
Wei'an, don't make accusations without evidence.

245
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,980
Senior, can you please stop lying?

246
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,500
I asked Professor Wen.

247
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,120
You voluntarily sent that video of my aunt to him.

248
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,140
How many patients like my aunt are being confined in your so-called nursing homes,

249
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,160
being monitored and manipulated by you at will?

250
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,020
Also, how did you persuade my mom and my aunt to sign the voluntary withdrawal forms?

251
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,740
Wei'an, it's not what you think.

252
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,380
I'll explain everything to you another day. But now, I have something very important to do.

253
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,520
- Senior. 
 - Du Yuncheng.

254
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,500
If you don't make things clear today, don't even think about leaving.

255
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,100
- Get out of my way! 
 - Senior!

256
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,860
Du Yuncheng!

257
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,140
Regardless of whether Professor Wen holds a press conference today,

258
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,020
we'll truthfully report our findings to the Ethics Committee.

259
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,260
There's no way for HDQ39 to get on the market.

260
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,140
- Senior! Senior! 
 - Gu Yunzheng! Why do you oppose me on everything?

261
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,220
Is it because of Su Wei'an?

262
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,020
Don't you know HDQ39 is her only hope for survival?

263
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,020
What did you say?

264
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,620
How do you know?

265
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,860
I know. I've known for a long time. I know everything.

266
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,140
Ever since you dropped out of school, I've known everything.

267
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,540
You carry the gene for Huntington's disease. You're a third-generation paternal carrier.

268
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,900
In a few years, you're going to get sick.

269
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,200
Without a specific drug, you're likely to die.

270
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,860
Why do you think I wanted to abandon being a doctor to take over Grandpa's pharmaceutical company?

271
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,580
Despite so much pressure from the board, I wanted to invest in HDQ39.

272
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,700
This is the only mature Huntington's research project in the country.

273
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,080
If Wen Ran weren't Professor Wen's daughter, I wouldn't even have looked at her.

274
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,860
I'm doing all this for you!

275
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,380
A drug that can cause aneurysm ruptures and even cause death.

276
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,780
You're actually saying it's for Wei'an?

277
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,480
Yes.

278
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:45,100
I've already analyzed the impact of hypertension on the medication.

279
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Gu Yunzheng, do you think you're the only clever one?

280
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,620
As long as Wei'an doesn't have high blood pressure, the drug is effective.

281
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,820
Don't talk about the incidence rate of adverse events being four percent.

282
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,880
Even if it was forty percent, I would overcome all difficulties to make it get to market.

283
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,100
You can say I'm after money, or that I want to win.

284
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,920
No matter how you see me, as long as I can save Wei'an, I'll do whatever it takes.

285
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,560
But I don't need it, Senior.

286
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,660
Even more, I don't need you to sacrifice others to save me.

287
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes,

288
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,620
it's all wishful thinking on my part.

289
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,180
When you rejected me before, I thought it was because of Huntington's.

290
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,680
I thought that if I developed a specific drug, you would give me another chance and consider me again.

291
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,280
I thought we would be carefree and happy like before.

292
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,140
But I was wrong.

293
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,620
You only have Gu Yunzheng in your heart, like them.

294
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,620
No matter how hard I try, it's in vain.

295
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,040
No matter how good my achievements are, I'm useless in your eyes.

296
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,800
Before entering school, we swore it.

297
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,460
The Hippocratic Oath. Have you forgotten it completely?

298
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,300
Why can you only see that one percent of aneurysm ruptures,

299
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,580
but not the ninety-nine percent of patients whose symptoms are delayed?

300
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,280
For that one percent of people,

301
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,460
Huntington's disease symptoms occur for about ten years,

302
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,860
eventually leading to dementia, choking, and death, burdening the entire family.

303
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,780
What's better that dying on the operating table, ending it all at once?

304
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,420
Du Yuncheng, you've completely lost your mind.

305
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,140
Yes, I've lost it.

306
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,860
I was driven crazy by you guys!

307
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,760
Are you still the Senior I knew?

308
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,900
In our review,

309
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,040
Among the 300 participants in the HDQ39 Phase III Clinical Trial,

310
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,540
three participants suffered aneurysm ruptures,

311
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,380
and one of them...

312
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,060
Died.

313
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,500
After an internal assessment by the team, this is considered a serious adverse event.

314
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,800
It has been submitted to the Ethics Committee for review.

315
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:20,200
Therefore, I offer sincere apologies to the patients who suffered adverse reactions and their families,

316
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,980
and deep condolences to the patient

317
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,080
who died due to HDQ39.

318
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,820

319
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,740
I announce that the Huntington’s disease HDQ39 drug trial is completely suspended.

320
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,912
Until the drug mechanism that caused the adverse event is completely corrected, HDQ39 will not go to market.

321
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,320

322
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,600
You've won.

323
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,500
With your own hands, you've destroyed my father's decades of hard work.

324
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,300
Are you happy?

325
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,420
I wanted HDQ39 to go to market more than you.

326
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,100
Right. I almost forgot.

327
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,820
You also carry the gene for Huntington's.

328
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,540
Wen Ran.

329
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,060
Dr. Gu, your last show of protecting your girlfriend was so well played.

330
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,740
Scientific research is rigorous, and not a stage for personal grudges.

331
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,060
Dr. Gu, you're not my higher-up anymore,

332
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,260
so I might as well be frank. You don’t have to be pretentious in front of me.

333
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,840
Bringing your girlfriend into the team as an assistant, that's quite rigorous.

334
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,480
That's enough.

335
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,300
Su Wei'an, your so-called passion for research,

336
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,660
and returning to the lab, it's all just for your survival, right?

337
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,660
Yes, what's wrong with that?

338
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,280
I want to find a chance to survive for 30,000 Huntington's disease patients in my lifetime.

339
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,780
Is there a problem with that?

340
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm telling you, HDQ39 is your only way to survive.

341
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,060
And today, you destroyed that way with your own hands.

342
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:58,460
If you fall ill one day and there's no cure, it's the consequence of your actions today.

343
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,800
Wei'an.

344
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,960
Wen Ran, you truly don't deserve to be Professor Wen's daughter.

345
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,260
You already knew HDQ39 can lead to aneurysms.

346
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,960
Why didn't you report it to the Medical Ethics Committee?

347
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,680
This research report, he gave it to you, right?

348
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,020
Do you think you've done nothing wrong?

349
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,820
Yunzheng gave me this report to frame you.

350
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,300
Is that what you mean?

351
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,460
Professor Wen has been rigorous in his studies for his whole life.

352
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,580
He couldn't have made such a stupid mistake.

353
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,440
If it's not him who has a problem, then it must be you.

354
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:54,460
Dad, if it wasn't me standing here today, but Yunzheng,

355
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,400
would you believe him, or would you believe Professor Wen?

356
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,720
Jiehui was founded by me.

357
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,900
You've been in charge of it for just three years, but you've already caused such a scandal.

358
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,340
From now on, don't come to this old house anymore.

359
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,720

360
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,620
Is coming to this old house some great honor?

361
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,860
Do you think I want to come?

362
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,320
Grandpa,

363
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,580
ever since I was a child, you've only cared about Yunzheng.

364
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,840
You said I'm inferior to him in every way and you told me to give way to him.

365
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,320
He lost his mother, but you gave him all the best things in the world.

366
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,300
You pampered him and praised him.

367
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,780
Even though I'm the one by your side, you still prefer to see him.

368
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,580
Clearly, I'm the eldest son and grandson of the Du family.

369
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,540
Clearly, he has changed his surname to Gu.

370
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,480
But in your heart, I will never be as good as Gu Yunzheng.

371
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,740
And my mom, she prepared so many things for you.

372
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,580
Have you ever appreciated it?

373
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,100
Have you ever cared about her feelings?

374
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,120
Today, I just want to ask you one question.

375
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,500
What on earth did we do wrong?

376
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,140
Is our dignity worth nothing to you?

377
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,540
Shut up!

378
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,920
How can you speak to your grandpa like this?

379
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,880
Grandpa.

380
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,100
Dad.

381
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,320
I will never come to this old house again.

382
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
Du Yuncheng!

383
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,860
- We want the medicine! 
 - We want the medicine!

384
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,220
 Give us the medicine!

385
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,980
Call your president out and let him give us an explanation!

386
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,340
Why was the HDQ39 trial suspended? Why can't it go on the market?

387
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,300
 - We want the medicine! 
 - Give us the medicine!

388
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,860
 Give us an explanation!

389
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,580
Quiet, quiet!

390
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,280
Listen to me. We will definitely give everyone an explanation.

391
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,200
But President Du isn't here today, please go back home for now, okay?

392
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,110
I'll give you an explanation.

393
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,360
Yes.

394
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,160
Don't you want to know who's stopping you from getting the medicine?

395
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,760
I'll tell you right now.

396
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,480
How could they let my son stop his medication?

397
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,210
- She's here. 
 - It's them!

398
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,460
- It's your fault! It's all because of you! 
 - What are you doing?

399
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,500
Miss, please, just admit that you made a mistake, okay?

400
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,700
This drug going to market is my wife's only chance of survival!

401
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,800
- That's right! 
 - Your aunt's aneurysm was her bad luck.

402
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,820
But preventing us from getting the medicine, that's unethical of you!

403
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,020
Yes, give us the medicine!

404
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,080
- That's enough. 
 - Give us the medicine!

405
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,460
That's enough. Calm down.

406
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Everyone disperse, or we'll call the police.

407
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,540
Calm down!

408
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,720
You aren't sleeping yet?

409
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
I was thinking

410
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,820
that although HDQ39 has side effects, it's also the hope of every Huntington's disease patient.

411
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,360
I destroyed that hope with my own hands,

412
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,400
so where is the next hope?

413
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,860
Then let's create this hope together.

414
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,160
Since we met in Lakaya,

415
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,480
you seem to always be unlucky,

416
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,140
with endless troubles and a series of misfortunes.

417
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,800
Maybe,

418
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,820
in order to meet you, I've used up all my luck.

419
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,640
Come here, let's see who received the Outstanding Young Talent Fund award this time.

420
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,240
Of course, it's my Boss.

421
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,940

422
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,000
How come he's not there?

423
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,760
Director Wang said, my Boss's project on glioma had a great chance of getting the award.

424
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,220
Fan Fan, your Boss has changed the direction of his research from glioma to Huntington's disease.

425
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,960
Really? How come I didn't know that?

426
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,740
Boss!

427
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,900
Director Wang.

428
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,620
What happened? Why the rush?

429
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,600
Nothing.

430
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,240
All right then, Professor. I'll go change clothes, and let's meet at our usual place tonight.

431
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,060
Professor, here, your favorite Spicy Rabbit Kidneys.

432
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,640
Try it.

433
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,060
I have no appetite.

434
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,720
Tell me, why did you suddenly decide to apply for a project on Huntington's disease?

435
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,020
Our entire neurosurgery department has no foundation in this area.

436
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,260
Even if you collaborate with the internal medicine department or collaborate with international teams to apply for the project,

437
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,100
you'll be starting from scratch. Are you aware of that?

438
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,500
You're right.

439
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,780
You know it's a tough task, so I have to move faster.

440
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:12,790
So what are you going to do about your glioma project? Are you just going to abandon it halfway?

441
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,680
The glioma project has concluded, so I'm not really abandoning it halfway.

442
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,600
What about the work of your glioma research team?

443
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,910
Well, I trust Director Wang, you'll find the right person to take over.

444
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,010
Stop kidding around.

445
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,790
If you really took me, your director, your teacher, seriously,

446
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,640
why didn't you consult with me in advance when making such a big decision like changing your research topic?

447
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,610
Professor, one day as a teacher, a lifetime as a father.

448
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,270
You're even closer to me than my own father.

449
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:53,260
Here, try this also.

450
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,340
Eat it.

451
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,840
You have limited funds and staff, and it's hard to produce results.

452
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,560
Have you ever thought about these difficulties?

453
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,640
Huntington's disease is a challenge worldwide.

454
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,560
You might spend the rest of your life on this. Have you considered that?

455
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,100
Professor,

456
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,240
I didn't discuss it with you this time because there's nothing to discuss.

457
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,220
I've already made my decision.

458
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,420
I'm not being impulsive or being emotional.

459
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,540
Every step I'm taking now has been thought through.

460
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,420
I've even designed a tentative cure mechanism.

461
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,220
What I need to do now is to wage a long battle against this disease.

462
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,160
Look at you.

463
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,920
I think

464
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,900
this is all because you fell in love with that Su Wei'an.

465
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:07,540
Just for her, you changed your research direction, didn't you?

466
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,520
Professor,

467
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,250
do you remember

468
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,600
why you chose to research gliomas in the first place?

469
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,540
You told me your son's story.

470
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,580
He was 14 when he was diagnosed with stage III glioma.

471
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,940
Now, it's been nearly ten years since he left you.

472
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,020
I believe you would understand the most

473
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:44,320
the pain and despair of being unable to do anything

474
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,220
for your loved ones when they are sick.

475
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,560
Yes,

476
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,200
I'm dating Su Wei'an.

477
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,200
But it's also because of her that I was able to see all the Huntington's disease patients and their families,

478
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,020
and their helplessness and despair in the face of illness.

479
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,560
It's also because of this that I've gained the courage to fight this disease to the end.

480
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,860
Maybe in our lifetime, we won't be able to produce any results.

481
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,640
But isn't it better than doing nothing?

482
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,540
I knew before coming here

483
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,320
that talking to you would be pointless,

484
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,840
and I would be preaching to deaf ears.

485
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,960
Here, Professor,

486
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,540
have some of this.

487
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:09,560
In the future, I will still need a lot of support from you, Professor.

488
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,680
 I understand.

489
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,540
What's wrong? Did something happen at the hospital?

490
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,780
It's not the hospital, it's Yunzheng.

491
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,480
Yunzheng?

492
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
What's wrong with him?

493
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,300
He was doing fine researching glioma, but suddenly he wanted to switch to researching Huntington's disease.

494
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,060
I don't know what he's up to.

495
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,120
Huntington's disease?

496
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,660
I've never even heard of it.

497
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,820
What is going on in Yunzheng's mind?

498
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,420
Old Du, don't be anxious.

499
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,220
Yunzheng might just be on a whim.

500
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,700
He might switch back in a couple of days.

501
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,600
Switch what? Do you think this is a game?

502
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,460
Academic research requires wholehearted dedication.

503
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,760
Why are you getting angry with me?

504
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,320
In my opinion, Yunzheng is an excellent child, but you can't let him be for the long term.

505
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,560
You still need to oversee things.

506
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:39,100
However, whether he listens to you is another question.

507
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,400
After all, Yunzheng is not Yuncheng.

508
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
He has had his own ideas since he was a child.

509
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,620
Speaking of Yuncheng, I haven't been able to reach him these past few days.

510
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,300
- That's enough. 
 - Now, Jiehui—

511
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,900
Let's not bring up Yuncheng anymore.

512
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,640
Regarding Yunzheng, I have my own judgment.

513
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,400
Let's eat.

514
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,280

515
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,680

516
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,580
Boss, I didn't finish what I wanted to say last time.

517
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,420
I heard you're switching to Huntington's. I want to join you.

518
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,520
Fang Mingfan, there's no need for you to switch.

519
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,240
The follow-up work for my previous project

520
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,680
will be properly managed by Director Wang Huanzhong.

521
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,100
I just have one question for you.

522
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,480
Do you still need people on your project team?

523
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,920
Isn't it settled then?

524
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,260
I just want to follow you.

525
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:47,700
Moreover, I don't have a specific research project or the ambition to achieve any particular results.

526
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,650
Have you thought it through?

527
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,800
What's in front of me now is very likely a dead end,

528
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,460
or every path could be a dead end.

529
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,600
Even ending up with a disastrous defeat could be possible.

530
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,300
Even if it's like this, do you still want to join?

531
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,060
I'm not afraid.

532
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,660
Even if there's a dead end ahead, we can always find another way.

533
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,000
Let me tell you, my current research team only has me and Su Wei'an.

534
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,460
We're not just in need of people. We're severely in need of people.

535
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,400
 Xiao Zheng. When will you bring your favorite protégé home to show me?

536
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,260
 Who can get my grandson bewitched like this?

537
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,320
 I want to see who this is.

538
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,920
Fang Mingfan, there's only one condition to join my team.

539
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,880
Don't spy for my grandpa.

540
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,780
No, that wasn't me.

541
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,020
If it wasn't you, then who...

542
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,160
 Don't make things difficult for Fang Mingfan. I heard it from Xiao Wang.

543
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:20,820
Now, in the entire country, probably only my grandpa and no one else would dare to call Director Wang Huanzhong, Xiao Wang.

544
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,060
Exactly!

545
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,100
Director Wang used to be Grandpa's subordinate.

546
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,340
It must have been him who revealed the secret.

547
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,060
Boss, I'm going to leave now.

548
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,760
Hello, Director.

549
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,160
Why do you want to change your research direction to study a rare disease?

550
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,380
Although the number of patients who have rare diseases is small, their lives are equally valuable,

551
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,820
and they also need to be seen.

552
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,620
But why does it have to be Huntington's disease specifically?

553
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,970

554
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:15,100
