 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,060
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,890
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

6
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,440
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,250
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,220
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,080

16
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,980

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,820
I didn't see Professor Wen again today.

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,880
Su Wei'an. Are you still not going to verify it yourself?

19
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,780
Why don't you come to my lab?

20
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,740
I just happen to be short a research assistant.

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,860
Together, we can surely find the answer.

22
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,700
I won't go.

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,600
Why?

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,460
As long as I see Professor Wen himself and explain the situation to him,

25
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,120
his team will definitely be able to find the problem.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,820
It's not my place as a medical school dropout to overestimate my abilities and get involved.

27
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,620
You're more qualified than all of them, and you're more capable as well.

28
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,140
The return on investment is too low.

29
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,420
With the effort I'll be putting in, I might as well try a few more places.

30
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,440
At Zhang He, you should also be able to consult with experts through a mobile app.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,900
That's right!

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,250
I really can.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,300
How could I forget about this?

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,760
Luckily, I have such a smart boyfriend.

35
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Wasn't it you who begged and cried to win me back?

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,840
You're bringing it up again.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,400
Your boyfriend is helping you find another man. Aren't you afraid your boyfriend will be unhappy?

38
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,660
Then tell me, what will make you happy?

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,320
What do you think?

40
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,740
That's better.

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,100
- Does it still hurt? 
 - No, not anymore.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,840
Be more careful from now on.

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,400
Let me register first.

44
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Here...

45
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,700

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,660
Su Wei'an. Is patient Su Wei'an here?

47
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,240
Yes.

48
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,540
Thank you.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,440
Professor Yang, Su Wei'an has come to Professor Wen's consultation room.

50
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,120
Please come in.

51
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,840
Hello, Professor Wen. I'm Su Wei'an.

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,500
My aunt participated in your HDQ39 drug trial before.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,920
 Dad, do you remember the incident back then when they claimed my thesis was plagiarized and removed my name?

54
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,080
 That classmate's name was Su Wei'an, and she was later expelled from school.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,520
 She came to me a while ago and asked me to help her aunt join the HDQ39 clinical trial.

56
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,640
 That's a very serious matter. The enrollment is random and cannot be interfered with.

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,240
 I did tell her the truth, but I don't know what got into her.

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,020
 She insisted on spreading rumors that HDQ39 has side effects.

59
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,980
 I think she's trying to get back at me.

60
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,740
If you're not here for medical treatment, please don't delay other patients' appointment times. Please leave.

61
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,420
Three of the participants in the drug trial experienced ruptured aneurysms.

62
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,640
Do you know about this?

63
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,380
Su Wei'an, you're really too bold, pretending to be a patient.

64
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,980
- One of the patients has died due to a second rupture of the aneurysm. 
 - Security! Security!

65
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,180
- This is such a serious adverse event, don't you care? 
 - Take her away.

66
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,280
I also studied medicine. According to drug trial regulations, you must report to the Ethics Committee immediately.

67
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,060
- Take her away quickly. 
 - Professor Wen!

68
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,380
Xiao Yang. What's going on?

69
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,780
Did any of the patients in the trial die?

70
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,960
Professor, this is the situation. This participant voluntarily withdrew from the trial long ago.

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Her aneurysm ruptured after she stopped taking the medication, and her family is demanding compensation.

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,620
I definitely can't agree with that.

73
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,660
Why did she withdraw?

74
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,040
According to the Declaration of Helsinki, participants in clinical trials

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,920
have the right to withdraw from the trial at any time, based on their own will, and without any reason.

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,700
The patient didn't say much, and we didn't ask much either.

77
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,380
Clinical trials must be rigorous.

78
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,020
We must clarify the situations of the patients she just mentioned.

79
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,420
There can't be any problems.

80
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,380
Okay, I'll take care of it right away.

81
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,320
Here.

82
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,140
What's wrong? Did you not get to see Professor Wen?

83
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,730
I didn't even have a chance to say a few words before Yang Wenbin kicked me out.

84
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,730
They kicked you out in public?

85
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,310
Yes.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,340
I'm not sure if Professor Wen knows about the situation.

87
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,840
But I'm sure Yang Wenbin is deliberately concealing it.

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,580
I'll think of a way.

89
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,000
When is my boyfriend going to get off work?

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,200
That depends on whether my girlfriend is willing to help me.

91
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,366
Keep dreaming.

92
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,125
What are you laughing at?

93
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,590
I'm waiting for you to praise me.

94
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,055
Praise you?

95
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm practically on the verge of collapsing in the lab, and you want me to praise you?

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,920
I've already told you. Medicine hinders me from making money.

97
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,740
Su Wei'an.

98
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you really going to give up your dreams like this?

99
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,740
Actually,

100
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,520
saving lives doesn't necessarily require holding a scalpel.

101
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,840
Medicine has long been our faith, as well as our instinct.

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Medicine has nothing to do with me anymore.

103
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,650
For now and forever.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,320
Then do me a favor and go to the lab for me.

105
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,060
Help me deliver this sample to Wang Lijuan over there. Professor Wang.

106
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,100
She knows how to handle it.

107
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,425
She already got off work, okay?

108
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:44,306
Do you think everyone is like you, never sleeping and never getting off work?

109
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:49,531
I don't know about others, but I'm sure Professor Wang is still there at this time.

110
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,860

111
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,140
Hello, is Professor Wang Lijuan here?

112
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,420
Yes, but she's not in the department. She's at her secret base.

113
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,940
What secret base?

114
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,980
It's her own lab.

115
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,300
It's over there. Just turn right.

116
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,140
Thank you.

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,120

118
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,840
Professor Wang.

119
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,960
Are you looking for me?

120
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,840
Come here. Do me a favor.

121
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,260
So do you also like experiments?

122
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,220
Professor Wang, these are zebrafish, right?

123
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,180
I'm not a professor.

124
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,880
As the person with the lowest academic qualifications in the whole institution,

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,640
I don't expect to ever become a professor in my lifetime.

126
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,020
Just call me Dr. Wang.

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,820
The genetic similarity between zebrafish and humans reaches as high as 87%.

128
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:34,940
Their life cycle is short enough that they can go from embryos to adults in just one day.

129
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,420
These little ones, in as fast as 48 hours, can help me find

130
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,600
and screen life-saving drugs or bacteria killers.

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
48 hours?

132
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,300
Yes, two days.

133
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,140
Although there may be unexpected variables in the process,

134
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,580
and these little fish may have to make more sacrifices.

135
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,620
Most of the time, those critically ill patients can only give me this much time.

136
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,520
Even if it means working without sleep,

137
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,330
I'm determined to win this tough battle alongside these fish soldiers and fish generals.

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,040
You see, once I start talking about these little fish, I can't help but go on and on.

139
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,740
Sorry for wasting your time.

140
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,860
Not at all.

141
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,720
Dr. Wang.

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,980
Doing what you love brings you great joy, doesn't it?

143
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,420
Of course.

144
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,620
Only passion can make us fearless despite the uncertainties of the world.

145
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,640
Which department are you from? How should I address you?

146
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm Su Wei'an. I'm helping Dr. Gu Yunzheng deliver samples to you.

147
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,280
The Neurosurgery Department, right?

148
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,880
Well Dr. Su, leave the rest to me.

149
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,400
I... I'm not a doctor.

150
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,820
Dr. Wang.

151
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,920
As expected, you're still here.

152
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,640
Academician Wu.

153
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,300
The renowned expert in cardiology.

154
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,120
You've been featured in magazines, right?

155
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,600
Academician Wu. It's so late, and you're still delivering samples here personally.

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,880
Look, you're a big star now. You have fans wherever you go.

157
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,700
In our Huaren Lab, Dr. Wang is the real big star.

158
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,340
We're all your fans.

159
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,700
I just finished observing a few students' surgeries.

160
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,125
I knew you would still be working at this hour, so I came to deliver some samples.

161
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,595
You're flattering me.

162
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:35,340
Mainly, I've got a couple of tough questions to discuss with you, the microbiology genius, personally.

163
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,280
You're too polite. What can I do for you?

164
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,320
- Well... 
 - Then... I'll head back now.

165
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,000
Once the results are out, I'll call Dr. Gu.

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

167
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,980
- Goodbye, Academician Wu. 
 - All right.

168
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,400
Academician Wu, please go ahead.

169
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,770
 Dr. Wang, doing what you love brings you great joy, doesn't it?

170
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,220
 Of course.

171
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,600
 Only passion can make us fearless despite the uncertainties of the world.

172
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,820
What's the matter? Did you lose your soul?

173
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,220
It's unbelievable.

174
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:33,220
In a place like Huaren where the average person holds a Ph.D., there's actually someone hidden who only has a college degree.

175
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,380
Do you know who I just ran into at Dr. Wang's lab?

176
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,240
Is it a specialist in cardiology or an authority in hepatobiliary and pancreatic matters?

177
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,220
It was Academician Wu.

178
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,420
The leading expert in cardiology.

179
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,120
It's not surprising to see anyone at her place.

180
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,340
That famous doctor who lives in the magazines actually delivered samples personally.

181
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,440
What's even more unbelievable is that a prestigious academician respectfully sought advice from a college graduate.

182
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,880
Speaking of Dr. Wang, what kind of legendary figure is she?

183
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,660
Her?

184
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,300
She's a microbiology genius who has stuck to her dream for 20 years.

185
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,360
Dr. Wang never interacts directly with patients.

186
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,060
No patient knows exactly

187
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,160
who Dr. Wang Lijuan is when her name appears in the pathology report analysis.

188
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,770
Although she stays behind the scenes,

189
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,440
she's the hero in the hearts of every Huaren doctor.

190
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,240
But she'll never become a researcher in the lab. Or a professor.

191
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,220
So what?

192
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,440
She's still the treasure of our hospital.

193
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,680
Dr. Wang herself has never cared about these things.

194
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,460
Medicine has long become her faith.

195
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,360
So, Student Su.

196
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,660
Doctors who treat illnesses and save lives don't necessarily have to hold a scalpel.

197
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,140
Student Su Wei'an.

198
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,200
Are you interested in becoming the first undergraduate

199
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,520
in Huaren's history to have a publication in The Lancet?

200
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
You sent me there on purpose.

201
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,840
Dr. Gu, are you still not giving up?

202
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,000
You're still trying to create a Dr. Su, aren't you?

203
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,600
I didn't say that.

204
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,945

205
00:16:23,945 --> 00:16:28,040

206
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,260

207
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,640

208
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,680

209
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,020
 So, Student Su..

210
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,020
 Doctors who treat illnesses and save lives don't necessarily have to hold a scalpel.

211
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Mom.

212
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,740
Why are you taking my box?

213
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,280
I'm getting rid of unnecessary things.

214
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,460
This box of yours has been sitting under the table for a long time.

215
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,900
Look, it's all dusty. You don't need it. I'll throw it away for you.

216
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,480
What do you mean I don't need it? It's my box.

217
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,380
If you let it gather dust under the table,

218
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,700
I'll secretly throw it away when you're not home.

219
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,200
If you dare to throw away my box... I'll run away from home.

220
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,620
 You said you have a way to meet Professor Wen Yuliang.

221
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,660
Why don't I believe you?

222
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,420
The Neurology Annual Conference will be held next week,

223
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,540
featuring the sharing of results from the Phase III clinical trial of HDQ39.

224
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,740
At that time, in front of experts from all over the country, Professor Wen Yuliang won't be able to avoid it.

225
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,080
This is a perfect opportunity.

226
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,400
That is true.

227
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,820
But as an undergraduate student,

228
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,640
how do I sneak into the top special lecture in neurology?

229
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,820
Who said you have to sneak in? I'll take you in.

230
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,780
You're a surgeon. How can you get into a special lecture in neurology?

231
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,540
Because your boyfriend is the all-powerful Gu Yunzheng.

232
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,300
I collaborated with my former colleagues from Hopkins on a research project on Huntington's disease.

233
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,680
The project proposal has just been submitted to the National Natural Science Foundation for the Sino-Foreign Cooperative Project.

234
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,980
So I'm also qualified to attend the conference.

235
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,140
Are you teaming up with foreigners to cheat the National Natural Science Foundation?

236
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,700
Is there no due diligence in the application process?

237
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,380
How can you call this cheating? I don't see any problems with it.

238
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,780
Of course, there's a problem.

239
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,740
You've been researching gliomas for more than nine years.

240
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Whether it's high-impact papers or special lectures, they're all related to gliomas.

241
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,080
And your National Natural Science project is close to producing results.

242
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,100
It's always been regarded as one of the most promising studies in the field of gliomas.

243
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,300
How can you possibly have the energy to work on two projects?

244
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,660
Let alone starting from scratch on Huntington's disease.

245
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,440
How can anyone believe your nonsense?

246
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,020
You really know me well, Su Wei'an.

247
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,980
I'm happy that you care so much about me.

248
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,620
I... I just casually looked into it.

249
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,120
The point is, how did you do it?

250
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,320
I thought the main point was being able to talk directly with Professor Wen.

251
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,500
That's unfair.

252
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,340
I'm a scholar. What does fairness have to do with me?

253
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,570
Besides, to qualify for the annual conference,

254
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,100
I worked hard to write the project proposal.

255
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,780
Even if I didn't contribute anything, I still put in the effort. Shouldn't that be rewarded?

256
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,060
So you've been working tirelessly day and night recently just for this?

257
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,340
Well, now I realize

258
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,700
that you only respond to softness and not force.

259
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,120
So with you, only these little tricks will work.

260
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,080
In the past, I always acted without saying anything,

261
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,900
because I was afraid it might burden you.

262
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,800
Now, I think it's good to have a burden.

263
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,680
What's good about it?

264
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,900
If you have a burden, you won't leave without saying goodbye.

265
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,740
You really like to hold grudges.

266
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,340
So this is what you're like, Professor Gu.

267
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,700
I can't help it. I'm truly terrified.

268
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,340
I always feel that the more you owe me, the more reluctant you'll be to leave me.

269
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,980
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have kept running away before.

270
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,090
Wei'an.

271
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,920
My heart was put back together piece by piece.

272
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,320
You must take good care of it.

273
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,740
I promise I'll never leave without saying goodbye again.

274
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,140
Okay.

275
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,180
I'll at least leave a letter.

276
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,720
Su Wei'an!

277
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,620

278
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,640
Hello.

279
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,760
We're here for the National Neurology Academic Conference.

280
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,950
Okay. Hello. Identification, please.

281
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,640
Thank you. Please wait a moment.

282
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,600
- Professor Gu, here's your room key. 
 - Thank you.

283
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,320
You'll be staying in Room 406. It's our king-size sea view room.

284
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,900
- Okay, thank you. 
 - What about my room?

285
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,950
Both of you are staying in Room 406 with the sea view.

286
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,260
In one room?

287
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,060
Yes.

288
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,090
Can you get me a separate room, please?

289
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,560
I'm so sorry, Miss, but we don't have any more rooms available.

290
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,000
I have nothing to do with this.

291
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,240
Hello. I'm Leo, in charge of reception. Is there any problem with check-in?

292
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm Gu Yunzheng from Huaren Hospital.

293
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
We need another room right now.

294
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm so sorry. The hotel is full today.

295
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,760
Professor Gu, is there something wrong with your room?

296
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,040
This is my companion, Miss Su Wei'an.

297
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,720
I marked her gender on the registration form.

298
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,520
But now, the two of us have been put in the same room.

299
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,500
Let me check.

300
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,460
That's right.

301
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,720
Miss Su was previously not on the list of attending delegates.

302
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,400
As your companion, we arranged accommodations for her as a member of your family.

303
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,560
Is she not a member of your family?

304
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,960
Well, not entirely.

305
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,420
Then that's a yes.

306
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,971
Many people are participating in this Neurology Annual Conference,

307
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:58,820
so the hotel rooms are quite limited. It's also difficult for us to make arrangements.

308
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,840
So please, Professor Gu, I hope you can understand.

309
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,580
Are there no rooms available at all?

310
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm sorry, but there really are none left.

311
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,940
So...

312
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Would you mind checking again?

313
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,580
Okay.

314
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,040
Hello? Do you have any rooms available tonight?

315
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,980
All right. Thank you.

316
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Hello? Do you have any rooms available tonight?

317
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,290
It's quite late, so it's hard to get a room on short notice.

318
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,640
Thank you.

319
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,760
What do you say?

320
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,060
Let's just make do for tonight.

321
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm fine with anything. It's up to you.

322
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,860
Thank you.

323
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,460
There's only one bed?

324
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,000
Whoever gets the bed first will sleep there.

325
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Stop.

326
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
It was obviously you who booked one less room.

327
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,660
And you still say we can take it slow. I think you did it on purpose.

328
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,740
Student Xiao Su.

329
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,180
You can't defame my character.

330
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,000
Student Xiao Su.

331
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,340
This is called a tactic. Do you understand?

332
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,280
Why is it so hard?

333
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,209
Abdominal mass. It's time to get a CT scan.

334
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,800
Wei'an, stop it.

335
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,740
Is Dr. Gu ever shy?

336
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,290
Feel it more carefully.

337
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,460
Is it abdominal muscles, or is it an abdominal mass?

338
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm going to take a shower.

339
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,900
Shower?

340
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,760
I... I mean taking a shower before bed.

341
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,800
Don't get me wrong.

342
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,520
Student Su. Is it you who misunderstood, or is it me?

343
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,400
You have unhealthy thoughts. You can't blame me.

344
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,620
You're the one with unhealthy thoughts. I don't know what you're talking about.

345
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,420
So you don't know what I'm talking about.

346
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,360
No, I don't.

347
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Then let me tell you.

348
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,360
Didn't we say we'd take it slow?

349
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,120
It was just a kiss. It's slow enough.

350
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:41,600
All right.

351
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,940
Go take a shower first. Rest early tonight.

352
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,940
 Gu Yunzheng, you cunning fox.

353
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,680
Did you call me?

354
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,380
 No.

355
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,560

356
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,420
Am I disturbing you?

357
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,240
No.

358
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,600
How much longer will this take you?

359
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
I'm almost done.

360
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,100
I'm revising the project proposal based on the latest feedback.

361
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,300
What can I do to help?

362
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,280
Some experts pointed out

363
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,920
that too large a sample size may pose difficulties in terms of feasibility.

364
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,940
What about a crossover trial?

365
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,400
It'll make the calculations more difficult.

366
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,160
How many experimental conditions are there?

367
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,860
Two.

368
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,420
Two.

369
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,540
Two is fine, right? 0.3% multiplied by 164 and then divided by four.

370
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,320
No, you also have to divide it by two.

371
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,360
So does that also have to be changed?

372
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,120
Which one?

373
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,820
This one.

374
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,740
Yes, it has to be changed.

375
00:31:50,596 --> 00:31:53,096
You... do it yourself.

376
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,660
What are you doing?

377
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,860
I'm giving you a good angle.

378
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,360
Anyway, you're going to sneak a peek at me when you can't sleep.

379
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,280
Who's peeking at you? I'm not.

380
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,515
How much longer are you going to be working?

381
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:27,220
I'm almost done. I just need to make a few more changes to the project background.

382
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,860
Well...

383
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,140
Don't sleep on the sofa later. I don't think it's very comfortable.

384
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,067
Sleep on the bed.

385
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,620
B-But first, let's make it clear. This line is the boundary.

386
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,600
Don't cross the line.

387
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay, I won't.

388
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,600

389
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,460

390
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,640

391
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,520
 Wei'an. You know what? Actually, I get scared too.

392
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,105
 Since I've been in medicine, I've never been so scared.

393
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,760
 I'm afraid I won't be able to create a miracle.

394
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,360
 I'm afraid...

395
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,220
 that you'll leave me.

396
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,340
Where are you going?

397
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,080
Am I squeezing you?

398
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm used to it. It's not the first time I've slept with you.

399
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,040
I told you not to talk about that night anymore.

400
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,440
What are you thinking?

401
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,640
I was talking about the pharmacy at Friendship Hospital. You pressed on me all night.

402
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,780
Wei'an.

403
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,480
Have you ever thought that as long as we're together,

404
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,040
even if you press on me or squeeze me all night,

405
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,420
I still enjoy it?

406
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,780
As long as we're together,

407
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,480
even if one day you become foolish or disabled,

408
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,100
I'm willing.

409
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,479
At first, squeezing you may have been romantic or joyful.

410
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,560
But as time goes by,

411
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,280
if you don't sleep well for a long time,

412
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,020
or when you're dizzy after standing in the operating room all day,

413
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,840
you'll realize that what you really like is a normal and simple life.

414
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,340
It's human nature to be selfish.

415
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,980
While we still have our sanity, we should think more for others.

416
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,520
Naturally, we should consider others more.

417
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,000
Let's get up.

418
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,680
The Huntington's disease drug trial needs to reach a sample size of 300 patients.

419
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,340
That's practically an impossible task.

420
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:05,280
But in reality, we haven't had trouble with the sample size.

421
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,580
The patients who participated in the trial were very enthusiastic and eager.

422
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,820
Because there is currently no cure for Huntington's disease.

423
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,520
Patients can only take irreversible steps towards loss of control,

424
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,140
cognitive decline, and ultimately, death.

425
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:28,960
Any slight improvement is a big surprise for a life of misery that already has a predetermined end.

426
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,940
Now, the clinical trial has entered Phase III, and the new drug will be launched soon.

427
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,695
For them, this is the greatest, and perhaps the only hope.

428
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,980
Next, let's take a look at this patient.

429
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,940

430
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:01,280
These are imaging records from before participating in the drug trial to the post-trial period.

431
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,340

432
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,620
Auntie.

433
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,640
Please take a look, everyone.

434
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,840
The frequency and amplitude of movement in the limbs due to chorea have already decreased significantly.

435
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,260
Wei'an, let's not watch anymore.

436
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,480
We'll leave right now. Let's go.

437
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,240
Thank you, Professor Wen, for your wonderful presentation. We'll now move on to questions.

438
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,730
Wei'an.

439
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Wei'an.

440
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,780
That lady, please.

441
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,900
Oh, no.

442
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,420
Professor Wen highlighted the efficacy of the new drug.

443
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,480
So, may I ask if any adverse events were observed during the course of the trial?

444
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,614
Based on the real-time feedback from the current trial,

445
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:07,180
aside from some common gastrointestinal adverse events,

446
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,740
there have also been reports of discomfort such as dizziness and lightheadedness.

447
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,440
Apart from that, there haven't been any significant adverse events.

448
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,740
So, the adverse events resulting from the three ruptured aneurysms

449
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,780
weren't serious?

450
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,860
- There was such a situation? 
 - Is that right?

451
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,440
This is quite serious.

452
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,620
Young lady, you have to have a basis for your claims.

453
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:43,280
If I'm not mistaken, you're a family member of one of the patients, right?

454
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,740
As far as I know, the patient you're referring to has voluntarily requested to withdraw from the trial.

455
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,180
So, according to the rules, for those who withdraw voluntarily, any events that occur have nothing to do with the trial.

456
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,220
It was clearly after the adverse ruptured aneurysm event

457
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,440
that the patient was arranged to withdraw from the drug trial.

458
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,400
Please take a look.

459
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,500
This is the voluntary withdrawal agreement.

460
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,940
You can check to see if the signatures on it

461
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,240
are those of the patient and the immediate family member.

462
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,740
As far as I know, you're not in the medical profession.

463
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,220
So how did you get into this professional conference?

464
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,240
You're even asking such unprofessional questions.

465
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,600
It's okay. Sit down first.

466
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,900
Hello, Professor Wen.

467
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,220
I'm Dr. Gu Yunzheng, associate director of the Neurosurgery Department at Huaren Hospital.

468
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,350
Neurosurgeons attending an internal medicine conference

469
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,080
is quite rare.

470
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,940
I'm here for the conference because there's a crossover topic.

471
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,420
In the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, neurology and neurosurgery have always worked closely together.

472
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,700
But that's not the most important thing. The important thing is

473
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:35,200
that one of the patients who experienced a ruptured aneurysm during the drug trial happened to be under my care.

474
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,020
The other two were treated at a second hospital.

475
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,340
Unfortunately, one of the patients at the second hospital

476
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,720
passed away the night they had a second aneurysm rupture.

00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:59,520
We have detailed medical records for all the patients, and they were synchronized with Professor Wen's team immediately.

478
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,540
But for some reason, it seems that you're still quite unclear about the situation.

479
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,900
Professor Wen, can you give us an explanation?

480
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,520
I believe that a disease can be caused by many factors.

481
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,440
But I have full confidence that my team

482
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,140
will analyze and evaluate these three patients in detail as soon as possible.

483
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,840
I'll personally follow up on their cases and then make a final conclusion.

484
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,780
Thank you both.

485
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,420
All right, then. That's the end of my lecture for today.

486
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,260
Thank you, everyone.

487
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,990

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,000
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,160
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

490
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,840
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:42,760
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

495
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:50,040
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

496
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,180
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

497
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,260
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

498
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,360
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

499
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,400
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

500
