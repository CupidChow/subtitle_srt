00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,060

15
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,060

16
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,540
It's all good. You can get up now.

17
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,180
Wei'an, I really want to hold you like this every day.

18
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,940
The medical aid program is over, the hospital wants me to come back.

19
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,560
The medical aid program is over, the hospital wants me to come back.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,500
But I'll apply for an extension.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
In any case,

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,780
I'll be wherever you are.

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,790
Where are you going?

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,560
To watch the sunrise.

25
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,840
Are you angry?

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,620
Actually,

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,940
the assistance mission won't have any impact on me.

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,340
As long as I apply with the hospital, they'll definitely agree.

29
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,300
I'm not angry.

30
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,740
And you don't have to make any changes for me.

31
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,780
I don't have any plans.

32
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,440
I always go wherever life takes me.

33
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,780
I don't even know where I'm going next month.

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Then...

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,360
I'll follow you wherever you go.

36
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,260
I just want to be with you forever.

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
Is that okay?

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,020
It's so beautiful.

39
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,140
Wei'an.

40
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,060
For the rest of my life, I hope to watch every sunrise with you.

41
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,640
 Then, I'll follow you wherever you go.

42
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,300
 I just want to be with you forever.

43
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,080
 Gu Yunzheng, I have no regrets anymore.

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,440
 I'm afraid to ask for more.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,160
 How long is forever?

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
 I can't think about things that are too far ahead.

47
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,020
Wei'an, if you're tired, you can rest.

48
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,800
 I may not...

50
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,140
 I'm afraid I won't be able to attend your 80th birthday anymore. But I'll send you your gift on time.

51
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,920
 Why so sudden?

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,160
 Do you have a girlfriend?

53
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,020
Yes, we just started dating.

54
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,100
 We're still getting to know each other, so I want to stay here for now.

55
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,660
No problem, you can stay there as long as you'd like.

56
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,600
 I will always support you.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,920
 I’m thinking, if you're already in love, I have to start preparing too.

58
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,840
 Which house should become your newlywed home?

59
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,170
 It'll need to be renovated.

60
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,940
Grandpa, aren't you being too anxious?

61
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,380
It's too early for that.

62
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,980
 Sure, no problem.

63
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,040
 Yunzheng, remember, no matter what you decide, I will always support you.

64
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,080
Got it.

65
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,200
All right, Grandpa, I'm going to hang up and go do my rounds now.

66
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,940
Newlywed home?

67
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Boss.

68
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,540
I'm going to go do my rounds. Please step aside.

69
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,130
Stand still.

70
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,040
What's going on?

71
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,180
His foot healed in one night.

72
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,060
And he's going crazy.

73
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,400
Interpreter Su really is amazing.

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400

75
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,920
Boss, you're not only good with scalpels, but also with decorating knives.

76
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,680
When did you learn such a skill?

77
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,800
 Sweetie, do you like the birthday cake I bought you?

78
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,300
 Yes. I also want a toy car that's this big.

79
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,960
 Okay, I will buy you whatever you want.

80
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,630
 Zheng Zheng!

81
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,820
 - Grandpa. 
 - Zheng Zheng, you're back.

82
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,080
 Zheng Zheng, put your backpack down and close your eyes.

83
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,540
 I have a surprise for you.

84
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,720
 Close your eyes.

85
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,500
 Wait a minute.

86
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,450
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

87
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:19,030
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

88
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,800
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

89
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,020
 - Do you like this cake? 
 - Yes.

90
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,200
 Grandpa, how did you know I like car-shaped cakes?

91
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
 I asked the employee at the cake shop.

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,560
 They said that kids like this kind of car-shaped cake. Is that right?

93
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,360
 Come here.

94
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,340
 Let's close our eyes and make a wish now.

95
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,560
 I hope I can see Mom again.

96
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,680
 - Okay. Let's start blowing out the candles now, okay? 
 - Okay.

97
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,520
 Come on. One, two, three.

98
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,120
 Great! Our Zheng Zheng is another year older.

99
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,540
 - Let's eat the cake! 
 - Okay.

100
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,840
 Zheng Zheng.

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,940
 Grandpa, you eat it first.

102
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,440
 It's so delicious. Here.

103
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,340
 Is it good?

104
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,720
 I feel a little dizzy.

105
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
 What did I tell you? Grandpa has diabetes and can't eat cake.

106
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,980
 You still made him eat so much?

107
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,160
 He's just a child.

108
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,800
 Usually, his mom doesn't discipline him much.

109
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,500
 He can be selfish and willful.

110
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,380
 Stop.

111
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,000
 You're making a fuss.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,940
 I love cake myself.

113
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,000
 It has nothing to do with Zheng Zheng.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,840
 Dad, you have ketoacidosis now.

115
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
 And you're still explaining for him?

116
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,940
 Don’t you know how serious the complications are?

117
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,220
 He's right, Dad.

118
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,660
 You can't spoil kids like this.

119
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,200
 Spoiling a child is like killing him.

120
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,980
 I can pamper my own grandson as much as I want.

121
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,360
 Grandpa, are you feeling better now?

122
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,700
 I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

123
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,380
 I’m fine. I'm just getting old.

124
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,760
 It's normal to have some physical problems.

125
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,280
 It has nothing to do with you.

126
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,780
 Grandpa, actually, I don't like birthday cakes.

127
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,160
 I won't eat birthday cakes anymore.

128
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,630

129
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,820
 It's so beautiful.

130
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,360
 It must be for someone important, right?

131
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,590

132
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,820
 Sir, are you not going to take your cake?

133
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,020
 I don't have anyone to share it with.

134
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,840
 Split it with your staff and customers.

135
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:48,680

136
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,920
 Mom, I finally found someone to share birthday cakes with.

137
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,460

138
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,380

139
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
What did you say? What did you just say?

140
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,160
Gu Yunzheng isn't going back anymore?

141
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,080
Why are you so excited?

142
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,320
How can I not be excited?

143
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,020
I originally wanted to use Gu Yunzheng's beauty trap to trick you back home.

144
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,000
Who knew he would stay too now?

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,460
I'm throwing meat at a dog who never comes back.

146
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,120
Who's the meat and dog?

147
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,720
You.

148
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,160
My God.

149
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,880
My plans are all ruined.

150
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,500
I matched you two because I wanted you to go back together, not stay in Lakaya.

151
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,817
Aren't you also tied to someone in Lakaya?

152
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,737
And you're still telling me off.

153
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,220
Wei'an, but I'm still very happy for you.

154
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,200
You're finally in love.

155
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,800
And Dr. Gu is such a good person.

156
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,960
With him around, he can take care of you and love you.

157
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,940
I'm also relieved.

158
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,240
Tell me, what did you two do that night in the desert?

159
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,220
You want to know?

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,220
I'm not telling you.

161
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,180
Su Wei'an, how could you do this to me? You heartless person.

162
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,020
I've never hidden my love experiences from you.

163
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,360
Why won't you tell me when it's your turn?

164
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm not keeping it from you.

165
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,720
It's just that we don't have that kind of relationship yet.

166
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,920
That stupid Gu Yunzheng hasn't confessed to you yet?

167
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,720
It's not that.

168
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,460
He... He confessed already.

169
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,100
It's just that I haven’t thought it through yet.

170
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,520
Isn't he the man of your dreams?

171
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Let me tell you, you won't find anyone else this good if you pass on him.

172
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,120
What are you still hesitating about?

173
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,280
What's the matter with you?

174
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,400
You've got the man of your dreams, and you're still acting cool with me here.

175
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,800
It's okay. You don't have to consider my feelings.

176
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,120
Just laugh if you want to.

177
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,380
I know you want to laugh.

178
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,200
He told me he wanted to be with me forever,

179
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
but I'm not sure...

180
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,760
if I can keep this promise.

181
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,220
Su Wei'an, are you humble bragging to me?

182
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,320
I'm really speechless.

183
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,620
Gu Yunzheng told you that he wanted to be with you forever, but you're still not happy.

184
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,800
If it were me, I would marry him immediately.

185
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,460
- Who's that? 
 - Sister Lan.

186
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,220
Really?

187
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,480
Hello, Sister Lan, why are you still awake?

188
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,560
 An An, your aunt is sick.

189
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,800
 She went to the hospital, and the doctor said she has something called chorea.

190
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,300
 The doctor also said that this disease is hereditary.

191
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,640
Anyway, I didn't really understand.

192
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,800
He also said that he didn’t know why it came up early.

193
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,620
 This disease is inherited from the second generation of the paternal line.

194
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,880
 It could start around the age of 30.

195
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,900
 And the disease will be more serious.

196
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,440
 It'll start at the age of 30?

197
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,280
 Most likely.

198
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,720
 Hello, An An, did you hear me?

199
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
 I don't know if you have time.

200
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,420
 Can you come back?

201
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,860
 Do you plan to stay in Lakaya forever?

202
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,680
 I beg you, clear your head a bit.

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
 What about your research project?

204
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,880
 After years of hard work, can you just give up if you say so?

205
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,120
 Don't you care about Huaren's future?

206
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,400
 Think about it, why did you want to study medicine in the first place?

207
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,040
I studied medicine to treat illnesses and save people, not to write papers and get promoted.

208
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,042
I can treat people and save lives in Lakaya too.

209
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,229
Anyway, I've made up my mind to stay in Lakaya.

210
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,149
You can't stop me.

211
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,160
You're back.

212
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,400
Wei'an, what are you doing? Where are you going?

213
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,080
I'm going back home.

214
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,240
Back home? No, wait.

215
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,040
Why? Didn't you just get together with Gu Yunzheng?

216
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,360
I've been thinking about it.

217
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,560
I don't think I’m suitable for dating, making money is more important.

218
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,400
Su Wei'an, are you trying to lie to me again?

219
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,860
I really want to break up with you.

220
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,560
Wei'an, did something happen just now?

221
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,040
Did something happen to Sister Lan?

222
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,260
No.

223
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,480
Su Wei'an, how can you not keep your word?

224
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Last time, you promised not to hide anything from me anymore.

225
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,900
What are you doing?

226
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Jiang Jiang, my aunt has a rare disease.

227
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,180
I have to go back right away.

228
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,080
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

229
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,660
I don't want anyone to worry about me.

230
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,200
Is it... Huntington's disease?

231
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
How do you know?

232
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,960
The day you were stabbed and hospitalized,

233
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,500
Dr. Gu searched your bag and gave you a full physical exam.

234
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,100
He wouldn't have done that if he didn't suspect that you had some serious illness.

235
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,900
So I couldn't help but worry, and I searched your bag.

236
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,720
I found the genetic test report hidden in your notebook.

237
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,160
Don't worry. Gu Yunzheng didn't see it.

238
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,110
Wei'an, that's why you dropped out of school,

239
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,140
risked your life to make money, researched euthanasia, and rejected Gu Yunzheng.

240
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,100
It's all because of...

241
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,220
this chorea.

242
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,440
Please keep it a secret for me.

243
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,340
Don't tell anyone, especially Gu Yunzheng.

244
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,240
Can you do that for me?

245
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,280
Wei'an, I don't think it's possible.

246
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,540
Is it possible that there was a mistake in the genetic test report?

247
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,140
I also hope it's a mistake.

248
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,340
I thought that as long as I was braver, God would cut me some slack.

249
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,740
And let me fall in love without any regrets, and allow me to  have more time with Gu Yunzheng.

250
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,920
But now Auntie is sick.

251
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,520
If I get sick, I'll get worse earlier than my aunt.

252
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,120
The future that Gu Yunzheng wants...

253
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,720
I can't give it to him.

254
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,120
Wei'an, don't say any more.

255
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,900
Why is God so unfair?

256
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,320
Why does it have to be you?

257
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,280
Okay.

258
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,760
It's okay.

259
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,000
Wei'an.

260
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,760
Jiang Jiang.

261
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,370
I'm already very lucky to have met Gu Yunzheng.

262
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,440
You must not tell him.

263
00:20:57,117 --> 00:21:00,157
He hates irresponsible deserters the most.

264
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,140
Just let him think I'm a deserter.

265
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,720
This way, he'll forget me.

266
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,400
 Beautiful.

267
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,860
 You like blue jacaranda too?

268
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,640
 I mean... you look beautiful like this.

269
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,740
 Ride with me.

270
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,740
 I guarantee that I can get you anywhere in the downtown area within 50 minutes.

271
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,140
♫  I know you can feel my longing  ♫

272
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,024
 Right, I found your motorcycle.

273
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:28,660
 I searched all over Lakaya.

274
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,060
 When I found it, it was pretty much destroyed.

275
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,260
 So I fixed it piece by piece.

276
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,960
 Now, I'm returning it to its original owner.

277
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,060
 That's not right.

278
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,420
 I've replaced most of the parts on this motorcycle,

279
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,660
 so we can say it's our joint property now.

280
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,779
 It's yours for daily use, but from time to time,

281
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:55,080
 you can also give your busy leader a ride.

282
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,520
♫  I know Winter might be far away, I'm waiting for you to come back to me  ♫

283
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,700
♫  We'll create new memories together  ♫

284
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,900

285
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,020
 Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be connected.

286
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,980
 Please try again later.

287
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,320

288
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,520
 Hello, Dr. Gu.

289
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,280
Hello, Jiang Muying, have you seen Su Wei'an?

290
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,580
 Yes, she left Lakaya.

291
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,880
She left?

292
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm also not sure, Dr. Gu.

293
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,480
 Wei'an has always been free and casual. She goes wherever she wants.

294
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,260
 It isn't the first time she has done this.

295
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,960
 I guess she has her reasons.

296
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,980
Hello, can you help me find someone?

297
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,380
Her name is Su Wei'an, a Chinese national.

298
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,920
 Ladies and gentlemen,

299
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,640
I'm sorry, sir, the airport does not provide the service to find people right now.

300
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,340
 The plane is about to take off. Please fasten your seatbelts.

301
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,500
Anything you can do?

302
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,200
I can help you check the flights. Where is this lady going?

303
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,360
Where is she going?

304
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,020
 Ladies and gentlemen, the plane is about to take off.

305
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Where is she going?

306
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,160
 Please fasten your seatbelt.

307
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,280
How am I supposed to know where she's going?

308
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,380
 The plane is about to take off.

309
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,940
 Please turn off your electronic devices.

310
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,360

311
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,860
Please turn off your electronic devices.

312
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,880
 Hello, the number you dialed is busy.

313
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,980

314
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,520
 Sorry, the number you dialed has been turned off. Please try again later.

315
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,620

316
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,720
Auntie!

317
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,460
An An, you're back.

318
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,580
You're getting prettier by the day.

319
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,080
You're the one getting prettier.

320
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,160
Even after so many years, you're still so beautiful.

321
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,980
An An, did you eat something on the way?

322
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
Let me cook some noodles for you.

323
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
It's okay.

324
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,820
I ate something on the plane.

325
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,220
Go take a look at your room.

326
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,300
Your mom has been cleaning it up all day.

327
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,240
Go see it. Go ahead.

328
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,080
 Can't you put your books back after reading them?

329
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,040
 You're a girl, but your room is a complete mess.

330
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,220
 Mom!

331
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
 What happened?

332
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,120
 What is this?

333
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,100
 It’s fake. It's just a model.

334
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,080
 An An, how many times have I told you?

335
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,240
 Don't leave this thing lying around. You’d scared your mom.

336
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,500
 - It's so scary. 
 - I already told you not to clean my room.

337
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,940
 Look, you broke my model.

338
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,360
 You're not worried about whether your mom was frightened into having a heart attack?

339
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,160
 With your good mood, that won't happen.

340
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,440
 You can still dance in the square for another 30 years.

341
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,240
 - You naughty girl! 
 - Stop making fun of me.

342
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,180
 Come help me cook. Come on.

343
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,100
 It's so scary.

344
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,460
 An An, where are your scissors? My bangs are blocking my eyes.

345
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,740
 I have to cut them.

346
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
 I didn't see them.

347
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,860
 They're here.

348
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,580
 This one's good to use.

349
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,140
 Mom, those are my surgical scissors.

350
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,900
 It's for cutting skin.

351
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,300
 This is easy to use. Just let me use it.

352
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,460
 The one for cutting fish is better, so use that one.

353
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Does anyone miss me?

354
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,940
Do you want to come see me?

355
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
Coming.

356
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,560
Still looking up information on chorea?

357
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,900
Yes.

358
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,000
I want to see if there are any new research breakthroughs in China recently.

359
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,060
You just came back today, so take it easy.

360
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,900
Take a good rest first.

361
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,400
Okay.

362
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,660

363
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,460
Mom, look.

364
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,720
Zhang He Hospital really has a specific drug for chorea.

365
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,460
And it has entered Phase III clinical trials.

366
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,860
They're recruiting test subjects.

367
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,140
Test subject? What is that?

368
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,860
Actually, during the clinical trial phase of drug development,

369
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,600
they need to find some people to test the efficacy and side effects of the drug.

370
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,000
Zhang He Hospital has a drug for chorea now, and they are recruiting test subjects.

371
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,940
Let's let Auntie...

372
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,820
No. Doesn't this make your aunt a lab rat?

373
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,860
I think it's better to wait until this drug is officially launched.

374
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,340
No.

375
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,600
No one can predict the time from the development of a drug to its official launch.

376
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,260
What if... what if Auntie's condition deteriorates quickly?

377
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,200
Then the outcome...

378
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,460
Mom, if no one's willing to test drugs, then new drugs will never be developed.

379
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,710
And medicine will not progress either.

380
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,460
As long as there's hope, we should all strive for it.

381
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,060
Yes.

382
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,530
But your aunt, she's already suffered enough with this disease.

383
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:36,940
If this drug doesn't work, then aren't we giving her hope and then disappointing her?

384
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,900

385
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,120
I'll talk to Auntie about this.

386
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,510
Okay, having some hope is better than nothing.

387
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,440
 I'm sorry, can you zoom in here?

388
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,240
 Please wait.

389
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,440
 The wipers were all on.

390
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
 It looks like he suddenly lost control.

391
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,460
 Could it have been a sudden heart attack?

392
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
 Or cerebral infarction?

393
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,360
 Does your father have any medical history?

394
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,240
 No.

395
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,740
 If it was a cerebral infarction or a heart attack, he would've been able to control the steering wheel.

396
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,240
 But my father was conscious when he lost control.

397
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,900
 Dad, what happened to you?

398
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,540
 What exactly happened at that moment?

399
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,700

400
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,380
 This report can rule out that my father was drunk driving,

401
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,840
 or that he had a sudden cerebral infarction or heart attack.

402
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,660
 You mean that during the accident, your father lost control while conscious?

403
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,340
 Yes.

404
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,960
 I checked the surveillance carefully.

405
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,740
 Even though it's very slight, you can see my dad struggling.

406
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,320
 And his body seemed to be out of control.

407
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,760
 Was there anything clearly abnormal about your father recently?

408
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,180
 Clearly abnormal.

409
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,000
 Anything abnormal in the past three months.

410
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,360
 He was under a lot of pressure and lost his temper easily. Do these count?

411
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,980
 Anything else?

412
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,000
 He also fell easily on flat ground.

413
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,760
 Your father's abnormalities could very much be due to a neurological disease.

414
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,220
 If you want to know the reason, I suggest you go do a genetic test.

415
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,480
 Your genetic report shows that

416
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,580
 the number of repeat sequences of cytosine adenine and guanine trinucleotide in the IT15 gene is greater than 40,

417
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,140
 which is beyond normal range.

418
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,460
 You carry the gene that causes chorea.

419
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,540
 If the disease occurs later on, you may lose control of your limbs.

420
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,740
 It'll be hard for you to pick up a scalpel.

421
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,900

422
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 Our An An officially becomes a medical student today.

423
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,580
 l'll definitely work hard to become a doctor. I can do it!

424
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,460
 Study hard and work hard!

425
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,460
 It's a memorable day, let’s take a photo.

426
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,810

427
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,780
 Wen Ran, HDQ39 that your father is researching has reached clinical phase III.

428
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,020
 He's recruiting test subjects.

429
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,520
 Can you recommend me to him?

430
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,980

431
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,140

432
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,960

433
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,720

434
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,200
I just put on the hand mask.

435
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,470

436
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,260
Look, Dr. Gu has always been working overtime and staying up late lately.

437
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,380
Is he trying to turn anger into strength?

438
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,980
Who made Dr. Gu angry?

439
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,860
From my observation, Dr. Gu's pretty angry that Interpreter Su left without saying goodbye.

440
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,780
He's angry? Why do I feel he's a bit sad?

441
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,900
Be quiet.

442
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,340
Don't let Dr. Gu hear us.

443
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,920
I don't want him to assign me any more surgeries.

444
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm exhausted.

445
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,220
Time for a late night snack!

446
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,200
There's a late night snack?

447
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,580
Try my chips.

448
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,380
I've had them before.

449
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:44,600

450
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,850

451
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,620

452
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:08,220

453
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,820
 Let him have a good rest.

454
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,780
Auntie!

455
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,440
Auntie.

456
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,400
Are you okay?

457
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,460
Take this trash out for me when you go downstairs later.

458
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,980
These are all your awards. How can they be trash?

459
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:06,593
The way I am now,

460
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,840
these are all meaningless.

461
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,500
Auntie, Zhang He Hospital developed a specific drug for chorea.

462
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,820
It already entered clinical trials. I'll sign you up tomorrow.

463
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm not a guinea pig.

464
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,660
I'm not joining.

465
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,240
How is this being a guinea pig?

466
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,680
Drug research is necessary for treating diseases.

467
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,220
And also, your disease is developing rapidly.

468
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,554
Taking part in clinical trials is our best option right now.

469
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,794
My best option is to die.

470
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,860
I don't want to become an idiot.

471
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,400
- Auntie. 
 - A dancing skeleton.

472
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,020
You don't understand, An An.

473
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,610
It would be better for me to die than to live like this.

474
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,500
How could I not understand?

475
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,240
Don't tell me that a bad life is better than a good death.

476
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,680
These days, every minute and every second is a torment for me.

477
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,920
Death is the best relief.

478
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
Auntie,

479
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,180
I've already lost my dad.

480
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,200
I don't want to lose my beloved aunt as well.

481
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:50,891
Do you remember...

482
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,018
how you comforted me when I was anxious before my college entrance exam?

483
00:40:57,018 --> 00:41:00,178
You said that people's mentality is like an instrument's strings.

484
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,492
As long as you adjust your mentality,

485
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,400
you'll definitely find your value.

486
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,480
Right now, the strings aren't broken yet.

487
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,880
Let's work hard and keep the song going.

488
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,560
Okay?

489
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,940
We have to believe that medicine will progress.

490
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,400
And that chorea will surely be cured one day.

491
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,030

492
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,180
What are you looking at?

493
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,940
Nothing. I thought I saw something.

494
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,901
Yuncheng, I told you that you don't have to worry.

495
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,506
Just leave the experiment to my dad.

496
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:25,080
HDQ39 entered clinical trials so smoothly this time.

497
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,020
How about I hold a celebration party and wish a successful launch for it next year?

498
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,560
Phase III trials have not started yet.

499
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,940
It's too early for a celebration party.

500
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,836
I'm just seeing you put so much effort into this project.

501
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:39,860
I want to help you relax.

502
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,413
Okay, if you say no, I won’t do it. It's all up to you.

503
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:47,100
Right, Yuncheng, Grandpa's birthday is coming up soon.

504
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,620
What gift do you think I should get him?

505
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,480
Grandpa said he doesn't want a birthday party this year.

506
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,420
Old people don't like the excitement.

507
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:00,040
Then I'll buy some fruit and go see him this weekend.

508
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:10,070

509
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,060
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

510
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,220
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

511
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,800
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

512
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,420
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

513
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,980
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

514
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,640
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

515
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,720
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

516
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,000
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

517
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,240
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

518
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,220
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

519
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,320
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

520
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,460
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

521
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:15,440
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫
