 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,440
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,290
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,960
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,920
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,780

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,660
No, Dad. It was that Su Wei'an.

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,160
She just had to compete with me for the research assistant position.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,160
She just wanted to prove that there's an issue with HDQ39. She's up to no good.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,580
Xiao Ran, why are you still lying?

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,780
That paper was published in a journal with an impact factor of six back then, Su Wei'an was the primary author.

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,140
You stole her authorship. That is why you were reported.

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,880
What do you want? How much more do you want to hide from your mother and me?

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,040
Old Wen, calm down. Don't get so mad.

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,600
It is what it is.

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,400
No matter whether Xiao Ran is in Huaren or Jiehui, she still has a stable job.

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Stop defending her.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
I really didn't expect my daughter would do such a fraudulent thing.

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,700
Enough.

29
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,620
You won't go to work in Jiehui in the future.

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,820
Don't have contact with Du Yuncheng anymore.

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,120
Why? What's the matter with Du Yuncheng?

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,920
What is it? Do you know Uncle Yang?

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,360
His behavior is very abnormal.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
I fully suspect that he was bribed by Jiehui.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,480
So I think Du Yuncheng wants something from you.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,300
I pursued him at the beginning.

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,880
It was also me who begged to get back together with him after breaking up.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,940
Why are you angry at me when your research goes wrong?

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,620
Are you out of your mind?

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,660
Mom, how can he be like this?

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,360
Xiao Ran, don't blame your father. He has a bad temper.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,667
But you should reflect on this matter.

43
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,000
You caused the trouble.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,340
Yuncheng and I just made up.

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,460
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:56,100
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,600
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,300
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:10,440
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,640
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,850
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,840

54
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,100
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

55
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,100
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

56
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,940

57
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,060

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,240

59
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,100

60
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,280

61
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,220

62
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
How's it going?

63
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,160
Why are they all negative?

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,340
The incidence of aneurysms is inherently low.

65
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,500
Plus, the number of our first laboratory mice is also limited.

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,600
It is possible that this will happen.

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,920
This is the first batch of laboratory mice. We still have a second batch.

68
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,700
Now this result could be because our sample size is not large enough.

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,720
Maybe the second batch could have a positive one.

70
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,900
I thought about it carefully.

71
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,920
Although I still believe that our original idea was correct.

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,340
But maybe we can change the conditions.

73
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,180
Make an event with a small probability become a high-probability event.

74
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,060
In this way, we wouldn't be taking a chance.

75
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,100
High probability?

76
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,540
- Do you mean... 
 - Does your aunt have high blood pressure?

77
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes.

78
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,900
I see.

79
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,000
We're going to make a model of hypertension on transgenic model mice.

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,220
Maybe vascular endothelium in hypertensive patients is more sensitive to HDQ39.

81
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,560
Smart.

82
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
Busy?

83
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,900
Don't mind me.

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,000
I got a chicken soup for the soul on the Internet. It's very interesting.

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,900
Don't pretend to work hard.

86
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,000
The result won't lie as you do.

87
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,740
What a pity.

88
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,900
It is a surprise that one transgenic model mouse is so expensive.

89
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,300
If you go on like this, that's too wasteful.

90
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,100
Professor, you can't apply for a research fund now.

91
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,320
Even if they are not expensive, you can't afford them, either.

92
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Don't always think you are the smartest.

93
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,140
The preliminary experiment of the pharmaceutical factory wasn't made for nothing.

94
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,320
It's not like you are the best in the world, right?

95
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,400
So don't throw eggs against a rock. 
  (T/N: fight overwhelming odds)

96
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,300
Why can't you just accept Professor Wen's pills?

97
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,260
Besides, your scientific research ability is not at the same level as his.

98
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,140
Your scientific research ability is not at the same level as Professor Gu.

99
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,900
Why do you judge?

100
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,560
Young girl, why do you talk so mean?

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,560
I just came to care about your progress.

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,020
It is none of your business.

103
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,380
Don't you have to work? Why are you hanging around here?

104
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,200
You don't know yet?

105
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,200
What's the matter? Who made my girlfriend angry?

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,620
Someone from the lab bullied you?

107
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,120
No way. Everyone is so busy.

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,620
No one even noticed that I was there.

109
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,100
What's wrong then?

110
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,520
Don't you think the experiment is a little slow?

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,220
Slow?

112
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,760
We're working on experiments with cell models and animal models at the same time for cross-control verification.

113
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,860
The efficiency and rigor of experimental design have been greatly improved.

114
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,820
It's already fast.

115
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,620
Yes.

116
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,620
I thought it was okay, too.

117
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,600
But you only have one month. What if we lose?

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,040
Why do you always mention losing?

119
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,220
Do you have no faith in me? Or do you have no faith in yourself?

120
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,400
Su Wei'an, remember, we are a team at work.

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,740
We are also a team in life.

122
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,680
What you should think now is what we can do to win together.

123
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,200
It is impossible.

124
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Why would this happen?

125
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,520
The six plates of cells are all contaminated.

126
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,000
It's time for culturing soon. What a coincidence.

127
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,280
I clean the lab every day.

128
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,580
What is the problem?

129
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,340
The six plates of cells are all contaminated.

130
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,080
Don't worry.

131
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Clean up all the contaminated cells as well as the containers.

132
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,660
That won't do. It must be solved immediately.

133
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,480
Otherwise, there will only be more contaminated cells.

134
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,800
If there's no way to find the source of contamination in a short time,

135
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,500
I'll have to clean it inside and out.

136
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,040
You go back first. I'll go home when I'm done.

137
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,070
I must find the source of contamination immediately.

138
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,740

139
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,370

140
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,640

141
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,170

142
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,260
Why is it contaminated again?

143
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,780
What exactly is the problem?

144
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,940
Hello?

145
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,320
 Wei'an.

146
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,400
It's twelve o'clock now. Why aren't you back?

147
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,680
Why are you coughing?

148
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,800
Why are you coughing so badly?

149
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,500
Let me see.

150
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,500
You got a fever.

151
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,260
Have you been under too much pressure recently?

152
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,200
I think I just caught a cold.

153
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,220
Where are the antipyretics? I'll get it.

154
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,900
Wei'an.

155
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,100
Don't go. Just stay here with me for a while.

156
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,540
No. You got a fever. I'll get some medicine.

157
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,680
It's late at night. It's not safe for you to go out alone.

158
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,576
I was alone in Lakaya.

159
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,140
- Don't worry. 
 - You still have the nerve to mention that?

160
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,020
When you were in Lakaya, you got a hole in your stomach.

161
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,220
All right. Have a rest and stop talking.

162
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,900
This is the only thing in the fridge.

163
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,100
Bear with it.

164
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,860
I feel better.

165
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,700
That's good. Go to sleep.

166
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,240
Get some sleep, and it will be fine tomorrow morning.

167
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Wei'an.

168
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,600
If you're not here with me, I can't sleep.

169
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,260
Don't be so spoiled.

170
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,100
I got a serious fever.

171
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,200
You should stay with me.

172
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,700
Come on, don't do this.

173
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,200
I have to revise the experimental design later.

174
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Sleep now.

175
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,820
Did you sleep well?

176
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,580
It's eight o'clock.

177
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,500
I only wanted to sleep for two hours.

178
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,300
Do you know that you snore when you sleep?

179
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,860
How did I get into bed?

180
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,800
How would I know? Either you climbed in yourself

181
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,120
or I, a patient, carried you into bed.

182
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,140
Has the fever gone?

183
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,100
Why hasn't the fever gone yet?

184
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,300
I'll get some medicine. Or you can come with me to the hospital.

185
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,100
It is fine.

186
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Don't worry.

187
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,580
Go to work quickly. I can take care of myself.

188
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,480
- Is that all right? 
 - Yes.

189
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,660
I know my education is not high enough. I am not rich in experience, either.

190
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,600
But for the basic operation, I can still finish it.

191
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,700
Now I'm going to clean up the lab.

192
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,560
If you trust me, I can help you clean your experimental vessels.

193
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
If you don't trust me, you can watch it me.

194
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,460
- Then I'll start. 
 - Do you want me to help you?

195
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,660
Sure. Thank you.

196
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,260
I found the source of contamination.

197
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
You see.

198
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh, no.

199
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,320
Is anyone here?

200
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,560
I am locked here.

201
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,700
 Are you working overtime again?

202
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,021
 You have the nerve to criticize me.

203
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,620
 Why are you so hard on yourself?

204
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,420
 You are so diligent.

205
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,680

206
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,860
 Sorry, the number you dialed is not answered for the time being.

207
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,960

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,800
- Wei'an. 
 - Why are you here?

209
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,420
- Has the fever gone? 
 - Why?

210
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,200
-  Why are you here? 
 - The door is locked, and I can't get out anyway.

211
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,980
Instead of sitting around, it's better to find something to do.

212
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,150
Let me see if the fever has gone.

213
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,780
I feel better now.

214
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,300
Come on. Let's go home.

215
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,460
Let's go.

216
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,060
Wei'an.

217
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,764
Let's go.

218
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,460
Ready to let go.

219
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,280
You okay?

220
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

221
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,900
Good morning, Xiao Su.

222
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,520
You see, the positive rate of aneurysm reached four percent.

223
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,360
- It is so high. 
 - Yes, our assumption is correct.

224
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,700
HDQ39 has more side effects in hypertensive patients. It is more likely to cause aneurysms.

225
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,340
In this way, I'm going to take samples from mouse brains right away to complete slice staining.

226
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,300
You don't have to get out of Huaren.

227
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,980

228
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,300
Dr. He was reported anonymously.

229
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,900
The hospital issued an official document to fire him.

230
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,700
He received kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies

231
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,660
and charged patients who had no surgical indications hundreds of thousands of money

232
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,820
for chemotherapy drugs. And threw away the opened drugs at will.

233
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,840
Is it real?

234
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,920
That is big news.

235
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,020
Oh, man.

236
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,240
It looks like something is going to happen.

237
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,260
Gu Yunzheng, I'm going to beat you up today.

238
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,160
What are you doing?

239
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,160
Are you all right?

240
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,580
He Xiaoguang, what are you yelling about here?

241
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,500
You have prepared enough details to report me. You're trying to get me, aren't you?

242
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,680
If I were you, I would reflect on myself doing it or not. These are things that violate medical ethics.

243
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,780
Don't you say these high-sounding words to me.

244
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,580
Take a good look at it.

245
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,600
You lose.

246
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,960
Apologize to Su Wei'an.

247
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,660
It is impossible.

248
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,340
It's absolutely impossible.

249
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,740
You two are doing this together behind the scenes, right?

250
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,220
You played a trick on me, didn't you?

251
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,740
Great.

252
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,240
Let's wait and see.

253
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,940
We will see.

254
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,540
This madman.

255
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,460
Come with me.

256
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,380
Gu Yunzheng. Did you know for a long time that He Xiaoguang was reported anonymously?

257
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,600
Why didn't you tell me?

258
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,580
I am so worried these days. I am afraid something will go wrong.

259
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,740
What help would it do if I told you?

260
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:53,040
I didn't tell you because He Xiaoguang's existence has nothing to do with our experiment.

261
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,940
What about this one?

262
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,560
What's going on with this vaccination certificate? It's just on the day when you got the fever.

263
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,060
Wei'an. I just performed two surgeries. I'm tired and hungry now.

264
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,380
Why don't you have lunch with me later? In two hours, I will have another operation.

265
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,880
Surgery in two hours will be done by Fang Mingfan. You're just a tutor. You think I don't know?

266
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,640
- How do you know that? 
 - You make it clear to me.

267
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,200
Why do you suddenly go to get vaccinated?

268
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,740
The hospital had an epidemic a while ago.

269
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,340
As a healthcare worker, I must protect myself first.

270
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,420
Then I can protect patients.

271
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,040
But is the cholera vaccine necessary?

272
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,420
I think it's necessary. What if I go to foreign aid one day?

273
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,560
What if the local area has a high incidence of cholera? I am actively preventing it.

274
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,320
I think you did that to get a fever. You did it on purpose.

275
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,200
What do you mean?

276
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,420
Actively participating in vaccination is every medical staff's duty, obligation, and mission.

277
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,340
You are out of your mind.

278
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,700
Do you want to know why?

279
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,700
I did it for you. You stayed in the laboratory twenty-four hours a day.

280
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,740
You don't go home, don't eat, and don't sleep.

281
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,600
If I don't have a fever, who knows when you would go home?

282
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,920
How could you sleep for six hours?

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,340
You turned off the alarm clock that day, right?

284
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,620
I remember setting the clock that day. No wonder it didn't ring.

285
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,440
I just found some time when I was free.

286
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,580
But I didn't expect that the vaccine had such an impact on me.

287
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,440
I suppose even God can't stand it anymore. He doesn't want me to stay at home alone.

288
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,900
Okay, didn't we get all the results of the experiment?

289
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,700
We should be happy.

290
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,920
Well... Let's make a deal.

291
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,940
Don't hide anything from me in the future.

292
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,420
I don't want to quarrel over anything.

293
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,740
I miss you very much these two days. But I didn't have time to send you a message.

294
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,340
From now on, after we get home, let's hug like this.

295
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,740
We should do what the lovers do.

296
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,900
- What about this? 
 - We're in the hospital.

297
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,100
All right.

298
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,040
Since you mentioned one. Then I have to mention one as well.

299
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,560
No matter how busy you are in the future, you must have three meals a day on time.

300
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,340
I can't be with you all the time.

301
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,620
For three meals a day, you must send me a WeChat message.

302
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,900
I will check it.

303
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,120
And one last thing.

304
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
Let me introduce him to you.

305
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,500
This is my boyfriend, a associate-to-be.

306
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,750
Hope you can take care of him.

307
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,100
Let me introduce her to you.

308
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,820
This is my girlfriend, who didn't finish graduate school.

309
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,940
You don't have to take care of her.

310
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,280
 Great.

311
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
May I ask Dr. Gu's girlfriend if you have any plans for tonight?

312
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,140
Dr. Gu wants to have dinner with you.

313
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,180
Not tonight.

314
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,800
Today, my mother took my aunt from the sanatorium.

315
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,240
My mother told me to go home for dinner. Maybe next time.

316
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,920
It doesn't matter.

317
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,320
You see, we've been dating for so long. It is time for me to visit your mom and aunt.

318
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
It's not necessary, is it?

319
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,740
Su Wei'an.

320
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,540
Have you told your family that we are together?

321
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,280
Not yet. I haven't told them.

322
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,660
Then they don't know you are living with me yet.

323
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,680
Is it because your mother doesn't like me?

324
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,660
No way. My mother likes you very much.

325
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,620
And she's also grateful to you for saving my aunt.

326
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:26,220
That's great. In this case, I should go to visit them.

327
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,805
Go. Let's go.

328
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,480
Let's forget it.

329
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,160
- I'm nervous. 
 - Don't worry.

330
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,893
Who's there?

331
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,120
Su Wei'an.

332
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,060
Su Wei'an.

333
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,180
Hello, Auntie.

334
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,640
Dr. Gu, what are you doing here?

335
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,120
He is here for the dinner.

336
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,400
For the dinner.

337
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,000
Auntie,

338
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,340
today, I am not here as Dr. Gu.

339
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,160
I am now Su Wei'an's boyfriend.

340
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,460
Then please come in. Good.

341
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,540
Come on in.

342
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,180
Wei'an, you should have told me that Dr. Gu would come.

343
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,220
Please don't blame Wei'an. It was my decision.

344
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,600
I heard that you wanted Wei'an to go home for dinner. Then I decided to come with her.

345
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,260
It is just a little embarrassing. We don't have men's slippers in our house.

346
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,860
This pair is new. Just keep your shoes on.

347
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,420
Yeah, keep them.

348
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,140
It is all right. I should take them off.

349
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,740
Auntie, speaking of which, your aneurysm still needs to have a re-examination of CTA

350
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,980
to see if there is anything missed last time or if there are some new problems.

351
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,460
How about this?

352
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,860
When you have time, let's go to the outpatient clinic to do another detailed examination.

353
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,740
That's great.

354
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,900
Is the dish ready? I'll cook.

355
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,000
I'll go you. I will cook with Wei'an.

356
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,280
That is not good. Dr. Gu, it's your first time here today. How can I let you cook?

357
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,700
It's okay, Auntie.

358
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,980
Now, you and Auntie just sit and rest first.

359
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,600
After I cook the meal with Wei'an, let's eat together.

360
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,980
You guys go get some rest.

361
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,580
Let's make pork ribs with potatoes.

362
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,740
- Good. 
 - And then chicken wings with garlic.

363
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,920
What else does your mother like to eat?

364
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,640
Come on, eat some fruit.

365
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,900
Roast eggplant. Then a sliced pork with green pepper.

366
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,440
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

367
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,480
- I don't want to eat. 
 - Taste it.

368
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,460
I don't want to eat.

369
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,180
Sister-in-law, when did they become lovers?

370
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,220
I just found out today.

371
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,780
I have to say, Wei'an is really strange.

372
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,080
She should tell me when she dating.

373
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,580
I think Dr. Gu is very nice.

374
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,160
Wei'an has a good taste.

375
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,020
The problem is that he is too considerate and careful.

376
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,600
It feels a little strange.

377
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,920
That is great.

378
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,380
Be careful. It is spicy.

379
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,020
Stop it, Su Wei'an.

380
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,720
Wei'an,

381
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,580
come here.

382
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,920
Hurry up.

383
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,560
Close the door.

384
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,380
What's the matter?

385
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,000
How long have you been together with Dr. Gu?

386
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,340
It's been a while.

387
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,300
It's been a while?

388
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,140
During this period, you haven't told me anything.

389
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,020
Good for you. You have done a great job of keeping me in the darkness.

390
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,040
I am not hiding it from you. I will tell you when our relationship becomes stable.

391
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,820
Do you live together?

392
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,040
No wonder you were elusive some time ago. You didn't come home at night.

393
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,920
How dare you? So you are living with him now.

394
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,460
It's not like that.

395
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,600
It's because Gu Yunzheng's house is close to the hospital. That is why I live there.

396
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,380
It is close to the hospital. Why are you so lazy?

397
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,980
It's just a few steps away. Why do you have to move to his house?

398
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,340
What were you thinking?

399
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,300
All right, don't be angry.

400
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,460
Tell me about it. How long have you been with him? How much do you know about him?

401
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,400
What do his parents do? What are their jobs? How is their personality?

402
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,280
Will you be bullied when you go to their house?

403
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,560
The news nowadays is all about young people living together

404
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,360
and then taking knives when they quarrel.

405
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,494
What if you meet a psychopath? What would you do?

406
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:06,520
What are you talking about? That's exaggerated.

407
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,560
Nonsense.

408
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,740
All these things I'm talking about have happened in real life.

409
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,780
What were you thinking?

410
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,840
All right, Sister Lan.

411
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,680
I am sorry.

412
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,020
I shouldn't do that. I should have told you earlier.

413
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm too lazy. I shouldn't live in his house.

414
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
I will be diligent from now on. Okay?

415
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,640
All right. Don't be angry anymore.

416
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,160
Please forgive me.

417
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,260
Give me a break.

418
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,080
Please hear me out. Gu Yunzheng is a very good person.

419
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,320
He has sacrificed a lot for me.

420
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,400
It is a long story that I will tell you later.

421
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,580
It is his first time here. Be happy, shall we?

422
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,160
Be happy.

423
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,780
What's the matter?

424
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,740
Auntie,

425
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,650
I am a local. My mother is a bridge architect.

426
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:26,780
But she died when I was very young.

427
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,020
My father is also a doctor.

428
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,210
They're divorced, so I don't have much contact with him.

429
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,900
I can assure you that as long as Wei'an is with me, she will not be bullied.

430
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,420
And for your last question,

431
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,780
I can answer you with great certainty that I'm not a psychopath.

432
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,180
If you still don't feel at ease, I can do a psychological test.

433
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,340
All right. Go to cook now.

434
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,300
Go, Wei'an.

435
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,780
Auntie, I'm really in a hurry today. I don't have time for preparation.

436
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,980
So I only cooked a few dishes. I don't know if it's to your liking.

437
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,820
I hope you will like it.

438
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,720
Dr. Gu, it is your first time here.

439
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,980
But you cooked yourself. We are sorry for that.

440
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,080
It's all Wei'an's fault. She should call me in advance and let me know.

441
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,480
You bad girl. You didn't behave well when cooking.

442
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,700
Next time you are here, I will treat you well.

443
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,720
It is fine.

444
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,140
It's not Wei'an's problem.

445
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,290
It is me. I want to show myself. So I took her job.

446
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,940
Right?

447
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,020
Enough.

448
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,320
- Dr. Gu. 
 - Auntie, please just call me Xiao Gu.

449
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,180
Here.

450
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,040
What are your plans? Do you plan to get married?

451
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,820
Mom.

452
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,380
I have quite a lot of plans myself.

453
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,580
But most importantly, it depends on Wei'an.

454
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,480
I don't have any idea.

455
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,020
Auntie, here is the thing.

456
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,940
No matter whether we get married or not, and no matter when we get married,

457
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:02,600
my love for Wei'an is true. It will never change.

458
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,500
How to prove it?

459
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
You still remember?

460
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,280
How did you know? It is tomato and fried egg noodles.

461
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,380
And it's two eggs fried on one side only.

462
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:59,060
Wei'an told me before. She said this is the taste of dad.

463
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,060
So I've decided since then,

464
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,800
I'll cook it for her from now on.

465
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,420
Uncle is gone, but

466
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,560
the taste can go on.

467
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,960
Yes.

468
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,755
Wei'an, eat it.

469
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:23,560
- Come on. 
 - You eat first, Mom.

470
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,920
Auntie, you eat first. Taste if it is the same flavor.

471
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,640
- Come and taste it. 
 - Let's eat.

472
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,660
Come on.

473
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,270
Mom, I'll see Gu Yunzheng off.

474
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,420
You guys cooked so much. You two take it back.

475
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,300
Thank you, Auntie.

476
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,320
The two of us?

477
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,940
Take it back?

478
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,800
Don't you need to go to work tomorrow? Didn't you tell me Xiao Gu's home is closer to the hospital?

479
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:02,920
Auntie, don't worry. As long as Wei'an is with me, I will take good care of her.

480
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,680
See you then.

481
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,030

482
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,950
Why are you so nervous? When did that happen Dr. Gu?

483
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,380
Dr. He, don't forget to return your badge to the HR department.

484
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,626
 Gu Yunzheng.

485
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:39,440
 All these things happened because of you.

486
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,140
You're back.

487
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,500
Auntie, now the sound therapy room is under ultraviolet disinfection.

488
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,740
But the chess room, the billiards hall, and the yoga hall are open.

489
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,000
Why don't you go and play?

490
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,540
No need.

491
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
Now there are only a few people in the sports rehabilitation room.

492
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,500
And we recently hired a new coach.

493
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,560
Now there are only a few people in the sports rehabilitation room.

494
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,040
He can make a rehabilitation plan for Ms. Su.

495
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,900
I can lead you there.

496
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,740
Auntie, exercise physiotherapy helps delay the illness.

497
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
Shall we go and take a look?

498
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,500
Besides, I can ask the others out. So you two can also join her.

499
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,200
Auntie?

500
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,340
It happens that my waist is uncomfortable these days.

501
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,980
Can you ask the coach to take a look at it for me?

502
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,900
No problem. This way, please.

503
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,340
Ms. Su, please come with me.

504
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,160
Coach Sun, this is Ms. Su, whom I have mentioned to you.

505
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:43,040
I hope you can have a rehabilitation plan that is safe and able to
strengthen the small muscle groups.

506
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,560
Okay, then I'll get ready first. First, let's check Ms. Su's muscle strength.

507
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,640
Thank you.

508
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,620
 Let's take a look at this patient's image

509
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,640
 from before taking part in drug trials to after the trial.

510
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,320
Auntie, have you been to this rehab room before?

511
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,500
Yes.

512
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,140
Have you ever made a video here?

513
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,560
Wei'an, what is it? What do you mean?

514
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:25,220
Xiao Du's assistant told me it was for advertising.

515
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,940
It won't show my face.

516
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,720
How does his assistant know my aunt is here? Who introduced this sanatorium to you?

517
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,980
Is it related to Zhang He Hospital and Senior Brother?

518
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,700
Xiao Du did it out of kindness.

519
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,020
He was afraid it would be too hard for me to take care of her by myself.

520
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:49,140
He told me this place has signed a... It's free anyway.

521
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,740
So I want to have a try. And I took your aunt here.

522
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,180
No. It is a high-end sanatorium. How can it be free?

523
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,460
What are you thinking?

524
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,980
You even lied to me that it was introduced by the neighbor.

525
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:11,400
Auntie, did he ask you to sign the voluntary withdrawal agreement?

526
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,800
No.

527
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,340
I... I quit voluntarily.

528
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,700
I have something to do.

529
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:40,160
At this year's neurology conference, HDQ39 was widely questioned.

530
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,120
The party at the scene exposed three cases of ruptured aneurysms.

531
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,860
Professor Wen Yuliang, who is in charge of research and development, couldn't convince the public at the conference.

532
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:57,300
President Du, I wonder if it is because you tried to hide it from us or because of mismanagement.

533
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:10,990

534
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,020
