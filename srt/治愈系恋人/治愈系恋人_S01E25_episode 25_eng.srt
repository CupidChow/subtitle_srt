 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,060
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,440
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,310
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,180
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:23,820
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,980

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,980

16
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,020

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,280
You're here, so I'm happy.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,340
And when I'm happy, I feel ten years younger.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,120
This works better than any skincare product.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,700
Have some tea.

21
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,860
Why are you...

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,260
Auntie, I'm really useless.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,080
What happened now?

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,940
I originally was going to apply for the research assistant position at Huaren Lab,

25
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,780
so that I could contribute more to Yuncheng's career in the future. If we have more in common,

26
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,380
maybe he'll change his mind sooner.

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:15,680
But who knew that this position would be given to Professor Gu Yunzheng?

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,700
Su Wei'an is Gu Yunzheng's girlfriend.

29
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,980
So no matter how hard I try, it's all useless.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,280
Isn't this cheating?

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,660
How can such a big hospital like Huaren allow something like this to happen?

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,420
Exactly.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,940
When I took the preliminary exam, there were so many experts.

34
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,420
They were either eight-year doctorates or seven-year master's.

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,380
How could a mere undergraduate like her pass the retest?

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,420
Gu Yunzheng must have used his connections to make it happen.

37
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,100
This girl is really something.

38
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,500
How can Huaren let her do whatever she wants?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,180
All right, I got it.

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll tell your uncle when he comes back. He'll definitely handle it seriously.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,580
You're still awake?

42
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,180
I'm going to sleep now.

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,700
I heard that Yunzheng has a girlfriend now.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,380
Who did you hear that from?

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
You don't need to worry about that.

46
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,220
I also know that his lab is currently hiring, isn't it?

47
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,380
Yes.

48
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,580
Their team still needs a research assistant.

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,380
Why do you care about this?

50
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,420
His girlfriend is on the candidate list for this research assistant position.

51
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,940
What did you say?

52
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,480
Who?

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,180
Su Wei'an.

54
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,040
She's the only undergraduate student among the candidates.

55
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,620
People say that this position was designed for her.

56
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,180
Otherwise, how could an undergraduate beat out both doctoral and master's students?

57
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,840
If it's not because of this, what else could it be?

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,800
This is outrageous.

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,580
Yes, this position doesn't have high educational requirements.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,900
But I absolutely won't allow him to mix romantic affairs with work.

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,340
This is a big taboo in the workplace.

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,580
Don't lose your temper with Yunzheng.

63
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,660
Your relationship with him is already not good.

64
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,400
If you bring up his girlfriend again, he might hold a grudge against you.

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,740
But I can't just let him do whatever he wants.

66
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,140
Well... Xiao Ran is also applying for this position.

67
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,740
How about you give her the position? That would solve everything.

68
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,220
I don't care if Wen Ran gets the position or not.

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,660
But Su Wei'an absolutely cannot get it.

70
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,920

71
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,340
That's her.

72
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,180
Yes. It was her in the photo.

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,100
This is outrageous.

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,180
We're studying so hard,

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:12,200
- and she's just an undergraduate. 
 - She found a boyfriend who's a professor and solved all her work-related problems directly.

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,270
Read your book.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,820
Look at her.

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,180
I'm sick of this.

79
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,460
Shush! Keep it down. Don't let her hear you.

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,700
If it was already settled, they should've told us earlier.

81
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,220
We came all the way here for nothing.

82
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,380
Keep your voice down.

83
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,540
Don't let her hear you.

84
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,260
What are you afraid of?

85
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,460
If she dares to do it, she shouldn't be afraid of being talked about.

86
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,440
Why is the usually quiet Huaren alumni group suddenly so lively?

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,220
I'll take a look.

88
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,880

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880

90
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,080

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,580
Oh, no, Boss.

92
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,720
What's the matter? You seem flustered.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,380
Look, the news is all over the WeChat groups.

94
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,040
Su Wei'an is the Academic Daji. 
  (T/N: Daji is a character in legends who was considered as the incarnation of evil itself.)

95
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,860
She engaged in transactions involving power and sex with Gu Yunzheng.

96
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,980
Look, this is even worse.

97
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,800
Su Wei'an was forced to drop out of school after an unsuccessful attempt to claim authorship of a thesis.

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,580
Gu Yunzheng, driven by love, sought revenge by stealing Wen Ran's position.

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,260
Who's spreading these rumors and setting the tone here?

100
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,980

101
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,740
Wen Ran.

102
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,500
Crap.

103
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,240

104
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,460
What is this? What in the world is this?

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,260
Okay, okay. There are a lot of people here.

106
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,500
Wait, no. Don't you medical students all have very high IQs?

107
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,580
How come there are still people who believe such gossip?

108
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,860
This is obviously Wen Ran's doing. She's so shameless.

109
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm not surprised. This is her usual style.

110
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,960
Wei'an, look.

111
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,860
Dr. Gu posted using his real name.

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,680

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,350

114
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,180
He also initiated a vote on whether to support a public retest.

115
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,120
Everyone loves a good show. I'm sure many people support the retest.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,380
Wei'an, Dr. Gu's move to protect his girlfriend is so cool and handsome.

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,700
Professor, why was Wen Ran the one chosen at the end?

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,000
The hospital doesn't really believe those online rumors and gossip, right?

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,780
You personally conducted the entire interview and written test,

120
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,580
and the whole process was fair and just.

121
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,180
We can't revoke Su Wei'an's admission just because of one messy post, right?

122
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,140
Yunzheng, it wasn't because of that post.

123
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:55,980
The results were already finalized before the post came out.

124
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,060
Then... then why wasn't it Su Wei'an?

125
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,960
Didn't you tell me that she ranked first in both the written test and the interview?

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes, Su Wei'an indeed ranked first in both the interview and the retest.

127
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,860
However, in terms of overall academic scores, GPA from school, and other achievements,

128
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,620
Wen Ran is on par with her.

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,860
Moreover, Director Du also believes that Wen Ran has greater potential in scientific research.

130
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,180
Moreover, Director Du also believes that Wen Ran has greater potential in scientific research.

131
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,040
Director Du?

132
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,580
- Yunzheng. 
 - Su Wei'an ranked first in both the written test and the interview.

133
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,860
Why did you abuse your authority and decline her admission?

134
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,740
This person can disrupt the peace of the hospital. Do you believe that?

135
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,420
In the past, she caused a scandal just to fight over authorship rights.

136
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,540
I will never allow such a scheming person to cause trouble in Huaren's lab.

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,420
Without an investigation, you have no right to speak.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,960
She was clearly the one whose authorship was taken.

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,280
And she was the one who was framed.

140
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,720
What exactly did Su Wei'an do wrong?

141
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,420
She's talented in medicine.

142
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,820
She's capable, and she also has a strong passion for it.

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,080
My lab needs people like her.

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,620
Does the lab need her or do you need her?

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,160
Do you think everyone is like you?

146
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,640
You blur the line between public and private interests,

147
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,680
and you randomly brought a nurse home to be your wife.

148
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,560
Old Du.

149
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,740
Yunzheng, no matter how angry or anxious you are, you can't confuse right and wrong.

150
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,000
Yunzheng, no matter how angry or anxious you are, you can't confuse right and wrong.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
I resigned from my job before marrying your father.

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,860
No matter what, we're still your elders.

153
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,850
How can you say such harsh words to us?

154
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,260
Gu Yunzheng, you don't need to bring up those useless things with me.

155
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,360
Aren't you just here to plead with me on her behalf?

156
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,160
But there's a way to plead.

157
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,240
With your attitude, don't expect me to change my mind.

158
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm not pleading for anyone.

159
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,420
Competition should always be fair.

160
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,260
The research assistants in my lab must be hired on merit,

161
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,120
and not because of public opinion or connections.

162
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,280
Please take a look.

163
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,560
More than 90% of people have already agreed to a public retest.

164
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,400

165
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,820
This matter is not only about the reputations of Su Wei'an and me.

166
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,780
It's also about Huaren's reputation.

167
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,960
If you want fairness and justice, let's have another competition in public.

168
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,380
Gu Yunzheng.

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,860
I saw the posts on the forum.

170
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you know how unpleasant the posts were? Is this how you protect her?

171
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,460
Why are you blaming me?

172
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,720
It's obvious that Wen Ran is the one who started this.

173
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,380
Why do the messes between you two always have to affect Wei'an?

174
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,160
I don't know what sweet talk you used to deceive her into being an assistant for you

175
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
instead of being a supervisor for me.

176
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,420
If you cause her humiliation for no reason again, I won't let you off the hook.

177
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,380
So, President Du had previously tempted Wei'an with the position of lab supervisor at Jiehui.

178
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,260
Thank you for the reminder.

179
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,960
If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known that Wei'an is so passionate about medicine and research.

180
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,900
Gu Yunzheng.

181
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't take advantage of Wei'an's feelings for you.

182
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,380
If she suffers any more harm, I won't let it slide.

183
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,280
There's no need for you to meddle in my relationship with Wei'an.

184
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,780
Just keep an eye on your ex-girlfriend.

185
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,240
Have her stay away from Su Wei'an.

186
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,500
Otherwise, I won't let it go.

187
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,380
Look, what's this?

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,160
It's a retest notification.

189
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,240
Did your post work?

190
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,570
Yes.

191
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,460
Come.

192
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,260
Thank you, my Professor Gu.

193
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,060
Student Su Wei'an, let's reveal your true abilities to everyone this time.

194
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,480
Let's win this game fair and square.

195
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,200
Of course.

196
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,520
It's just like back in university. You've helped me get into the exam room again.

197
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
You've got this.

198
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,165
Dear professors and judges.

199
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:48,020
Before the retest, I'd like to say a few words.

200
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,580
I went through two exams: a written test, and an interview.

201
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,066
Then, I secured the research assistant position.

202
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,080
The entire process was fair and transparent.

203
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,480
I don't know what the purpose of a retest is.

204
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,540
If I still come out on top in this retest, can we consider it final?

205
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,640
Don't waste the school’s public resources just to open a back door for some people. 
  (T/N: Give them special privileges)

206
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,980
This retest is the final examination.

207
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,320
The hiring results will be announced in public.

208
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,260
Okay, Director.

209
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,080
Since we've already had two exams, just tell me your opinions briefly.

210
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,510
What do you consider the most important quality of a scientific research assistant?

211
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,280
- Okay— 
 - I think...

212
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,040
when doing research, the most important thing is persistence.

213
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,830
We can't give up halfway.

214
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:47,830
We can't just run away when faced with the slightest problem.

215
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,140
I went through eight years of non-stop hard work and studying.

216
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,830
Then, I earned a Ph.D. from Huaren Medical University.

217
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,000
While in school, I won first prize in the Science Cup, as well as many other awards.

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,260
I've also put in tremendous effort.

219
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,020
I know very well that achievements are not only from the past but also accumulations.

220
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,160
And this will only strengthen my passion for and pursuit of scientific research.

221
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,200
Su Wei'an, it's your turn now.

222
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
Okay.

223
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,740
I believe that, as a research assistant, the most important thing is to be down-to-earth,

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,040
and take it one step at a time, doing everything well.

225
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,180
Every piece of data, every inference, and every experiment should be rigorous.

226
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,840
One should avoid rushing for quick results and, more importantly, hold back from cheating.

227
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,640
Su Wei'an, since you value data and experiments so much, have you published any research results?

228
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,860
And you dropped out of school halfway.

229
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Do you really understand what academic research entails?

230
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,460
I do.

231
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,880
While in school, I wrote a scientific manuscript.

232
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,320
Did you only write it?

233
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,440
Writing is not the same as publishing.

234
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,580
My manuscript was once published in a journal with an impact factor greater than six. 
  (T/N: Impact factors measure the importance of a journal)

235
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,940
I believe the quality of my paper should be pretty good.

236
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,960
But why is the content of your article identical to Wen Ran's paper that won first prize in the Science Cup?

237
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,950
Did you publish it together? Why didn't you share authorship?

238
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,740
I also want to know why.

239
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,260
After the organizers received my complaint letter, they promptly revoked the first prize.

240
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:36,100
I'm also very curious. Why is this revoked first prize mentioned in Classmate Wen's resume?

241
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,980
Dear Professors, although this prize

242
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,340
was maliciously reported by Classmate Su Wei'an,

243
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,420
the organizers had only temporarily revoked the trophy.

244
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,400
I still have the award certificate.

245
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,260
Later, we provided the organizers with detailed supporting documents.

246
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,420
Our mentor's decision was indeed based on workload and contribution.

247
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,880
I didn't steal this first authorship from her.

248
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,540
You and I both know

249
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,560
that when I left school, I didn't take the experiment log.

250
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,780
So you concluded that I can't provide evidence.

251
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,000
However, all professors know that scientific research is a rigorous process and is all tied together. Nothing can be faked.

252
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,660
The fluorescent staining method was used in that paper.

253
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,220
Classmate Wen, as the primary contributor to this paper,

254
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,260
you should be quite familiar with the experimental methods and procedures, right?

255
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,360
Yes.

256
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,780
I think so too.

257
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,800
Because you used the same exact fluorescent staining method in another paper.

258
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,240
I want to ask you,

259
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,660
in the experiment, which company's primary antibody did you use?

260
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,260
It's been so long, and there were so many reagents. 
  (T/N: A substance used in chemical analysis)

261
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,660
How is it possible to remember them all?

262
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,320
You can't remember?

263
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,250
The article clearly states that it's from Meika Company.

264
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,460
You're right. Are there any problems?

265
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,220
Can you tell the professors here,

266
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,900
what methods did you use in your experiment to avoid false positives?

267
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:40,140
In my paper, there are specific methods and detailed materials in the methods section.

268
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,560
In the paper, I filed a complaint on

269
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,140
the primary antibody that was targeting the receptor in the experiment was sent from the United States in March 2014.

270
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,020
The antibody company added special labels in this batch

271
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,580
to be able to increase blocking time and reduce the primary antibody's incubation time.

272
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,340
They used a higher antibody concentration to allow for more washing, which can help avoid false positives.

273
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,800
After this batch, improvements were made to the reagents.

274
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,700
But Classmate Wen used the same exact method in a new paper.

275
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,780
She and her reviewer both didn't realize that, with her method, it's impossible to obtain any reliable results.

276
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,480
She and her reviewer both didn't realize that, with her method, it's impossible to obtain any reliable results.

277
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,700
Classmate Wen, do you want to withdraw the new paper yourself or should we wait for another complaint?

278
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,680
Maybe I remembered incorrectly.

279
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,140
The reagents I used might be from that batch sent in March 2014.

280
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,480
The two papers were written three years apart.

281
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,020
How could it be possible to use only one batch of reagents?

282
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,720
When the experiments for the first paper were completed, due to the large consumption of reagents,

283
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,580
Professor He Xiaoguang told me to order more reagents.

284
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,760
All of this is documented.

285
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Director, that—

286
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,380
I may have used the reagents that other professors had left over.

287
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,780
Professor, I have nothing more to say.

288
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,800
There's no need to continue. Let's end it here.

289
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,860
The Human Resources Department will come up with a plan right away.

290
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,800
Investigate the papers published by each department in the past five years.

291
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,220
When it comes to academic misconduct, there is zero tolerance.

292
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Director Wang, we must thoroughly investigate, especially the two papers authored by He Xiaoguang and Wen Ran.

293
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,540
There's no place for dishonesty in scientific research.

294
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,100
Huaren is also not a den for wrongdoing.

295
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,260
Director Du.

296
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,020
So what are the scores and results for today?

297
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,940
You're all here.

298
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,960
I declare that starting today, the Neurosurgery Department will undergo comprehensive rectification.

299
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,630
You will thoroughly investigate academic misconduct.

300
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,860
Dr. Gu Yunzheng, you're responsible for reviewing the department's papers.

301
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,580
No flaws can be overlooked.

302
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

303
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,480
Boss, who won?

304
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,840
Who won, Boss?

305
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,220
Su Wei'an.

306
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,580
I knew it!

307
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,940
Come, it's time to eat.

308
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,220
Look. What do you think?

309
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,840
This is the outfit I specifically used for experiments when I was in school.

310
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,340
Do I look like a doctor?

311
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,080
You are a doctor.

312
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,960
Here, let's take a picture.

313
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,100
Three, two, one.

314
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Okay.

315
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,960
Look! It's cute, right?

316
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,680
Seems like it.

317
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,420
Wei'an,

318
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,780
this time, you competed against Wen Ran and won.

319
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,180
But it doesn't mean the rumors and gossip will disappear.

320
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,840
Are you really ready to work together with me?

321
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
Of course.

322
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,060
I entered Huaren fair and square. I won't embarrass you.

323
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,600
Not embarrassing me isn't enough. I have high expectations.

324
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,580
I know, I know.

325
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,420
I still remember how you tormented me in the past.

326
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,700
I'm serious.

327
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,800
This time, we need to find direct evidence that aneurysms and HDQ39 are related as quickly as possible.

328
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,480
Otherwise, there's a risk of new adverse events.

329
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,880
Our workload right now is much greater than it was before.

330
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,740
You need to be mentally prepared.

331
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Does it smell good?

332
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,780
I think I smell a fox.

333
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,180
You...

334
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,880
I regret moving here.

335
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,820
It's like a sheep entering a lion's den.

336
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,600
It's giving you, the master, the opportunity to enslave me 24 hours a day.

337
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,980
How can I bear to do that?

338
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Professor Gu is ready to transform into a barista, masseur, or chef at any time.

339
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,580
He is available 24 hours a day, dedicated to serving Student Su.

340
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,800
You have a lot of identities.

341
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,880
There's one more.

342
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,780
I'm also the prospective son-in-law of the Su family.

343
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,560
When will you take me to see Sister Lan?

344
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,700
Don't push your luck.

345
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,480
It's getting late.

346
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,540
I'll take the subway. You drive. See you at the hospital later.

347
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,860
Wait, Wei'an.

348
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,560
You... Are you not eating?

349
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll eat at the hospital. It's my first day, so I can't be late.

350
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,700
I-I worked hard to make this...

351
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,340
We already live together, but we still can't go to work together.

352
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,860
What a tragedy.

353
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,080
Good for you, Su Wei'an. To get even with me and Professor He,

354
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,980
you defamed me in front of so many people.

355
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,700
I just stated the facts. How is that defaming?

356
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,840
The last time I video-chatted with you,

357
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,120
you already knew there was a problem with the antibodies.

358
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,380
Why didn't you tell me beforehand? Why did you have to bring it up during the retest?

359
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,220
Wen Ran. In the past, I considered you as a friend.

360
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,100
I answered whatever you asked, and helped with whatever you needed.

361
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,220
But ever since you went to Professor He and twisted the truth, you've no longer been my friend.

362
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,780
Don't think you're so great.

363
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,980
Yes. You conducted the experiments.

364
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,500
You also wrote the paper.

365
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,080
But without my father's finishing touches, do you think your paper would have made it into a journal with an impact factor of six?

366
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,700
So it was Professor Wen who made the later revisions on that paper.

367
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,220
Of course.

368
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,240
Considering your personal abilities, you couldn't have revised that paper.

369
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
You...

370
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,780
When you begged me to get your aunt into the HDQ39 clinical trial,

371
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,320
I got it done.

372
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,600
What exactly do you want me to do?

373
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,000
I really should thank you for asking your dad for me.

374
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,780
But I asked around. My aunt strictly followed the allocation concealment rules.

375
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,600
Is that also a reason for you to take credit?

376
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,880
Back then, you were the one begging to join my dad's drug trial. And you got in.

377
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,620
Now that there's a problem, you want to cause trouble.

378
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,440
I should have noticed earlier that you're just an ungrateful person.

379
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,940
Wen Ran. Scientific research has nothing to do with personal grudges.

380
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,540
Don't mix them up all the time.

381
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,980
It's good that you're aware.

382
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,720
So no matter how much you hate me, don't interfere with my father's work on the drug.

383
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,560
If you dare ruin his efforts and contributions,

384
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,500
I won't let you off the hook.

385
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,380
 Liang Yayi, why did you slander Xiao Ran?

386
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,340
 You can compete fairly to be the president of the Student Union.

387
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,200
 Wei'an, we can't control what other people say.

388
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,260
 I personally saw Wen Ran giving the former president a watch.

389
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,200
 The points among the candidates were very close.

390
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,080
 You probably knew that his vote was crucial.

391
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,760
 Liang Yayi, you misunderstood me.

392
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,360
 Senior was playing basketball and left his watch on the court.

393
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,620
 I just picked it up and returned it to him.

394
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,080
 You picked up a brand-new watch that was in its box?

395
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,200
 I saw it clearly. Don't think about denying it.

396
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,580
 Do you have evidence?

397
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,380
 Su Wei'an, Wen Ran is lying. I'm not lying to you.

398
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,020
 Whether you're lying or not, you should give us evidence.

399
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,080
 Don't talk nonsense next time.

400
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,100
 Sooner or later, you'll find out what kind of person you're standing up for.

401
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,240

402
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,770
 He Xiaoguang was questioned and Wen Ran's doctoral degree has been revoked.

403
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,795
My goodness.

404
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,035
Did they get fired?

405
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,300

406
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,640
 My dear Student Su, don't forget to clock in on your first day of work.

407
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,000
What are you trying to do?

408
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm asking you a question!

409
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,100
You took advantage of the problem between Wen Ran and Su Wei'an to slander me, right?

410
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,860
You even resorted to such dirty tricks.

411
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:07,780
Dr. He, do you have a bad memory? Who, trying to suck up to those in authority,

412
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:14,460
took credit for their own students' achievements, staining Huaren's academic environment?

413
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,140
That's enough.

414
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,120
Do you think the hospital director and Director Wang want to see us two tigers fight each other?

415
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,860
Two tigers fighting each other?

416
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
A fight between two tigers assumes they're both tigers.

417
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,020
Someone like Dr. He who steals their own students' papers is just academic trash.

418
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,960
You're just seeking revenge on me for your personal gain.

419
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,480
You're doing it all for her.

420
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,460
Who's Su Wei'an? She's just a crazy woman!

421
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,140
She dared to make a bet with Professor Wen at the Neurology Annual Conference.

422
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,560
Who is she compared to Professor Wen? Are they at the same level?

423
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
I'm sincerely advising you.

424
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,120
Don't risk your reputation for her.

425
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,200
But what if she proves it?

426
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
I'll leave Huaren!

427
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,840
In addition to leaving Huaren, you also need to publicly admit what you did to her back then and apologize.

428
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,540
If Su Wei'an can't prove that HDQ39 can indeed cause aneurysms,

429
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,520
you'll leave Huaren together with her.

430
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,120
Deal?

431
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Deal.

432
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,540
Make sure you keep your word.

433
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,420
You have one month.

434
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,380
Did you guys see the notice board?

435
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,380
The hospital is thoroughly investigating academic misconduct.

436
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,040
They punished He Xiaoguang and Wen Ran severely.

437
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,000
Professor He has such a dark history.

438
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,580
From now on, it'll be impossible for him to get promoted.

439
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,940
And Wen Ran has had her Ph.D. revoked.

440
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,185
She's just an undergraduate now.

441
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,800
Su Wei'an is really amazing.

442
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,580
This is a perfect example that it's never too late for revenge.

443
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,140
She has gone through—

444
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,520
Su Wei'an. Come here.

445
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,201
What is it, Professor Gu?

446
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:28,760
When it comes to medicine for Huntington's dopamine system, how many main categories are there?

447
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,140
How do they work?

448
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,740
There are two main categories. One targets motor symptoms and the other is for non-motor symptoms.

449
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,805
It works mainly by inhibiting VMAT  (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy)  and directly blocking dopamine receptors.

450
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,340
Among the drugs currently under development,

451
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,180
how many have entered Phase III clinical trials in the past two years?

452
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,480
Three.

453
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,500
They are NRT057, HYD902 and HDQ39.

454
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,040
But the first two drugs have been stuck in a bottleneck for more than a year.

455
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,825
What's the reason for that?

456
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:57,120
The reason...

457
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,180
The reason is complicated.

458
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,520
These two drugs have been analyzed in the paper on the Phase III clinical trial results.

459
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,600
And the subgroup analysis also shows significant differences.

460
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,920
One opinion is that the effects of this drug may be long-term.

461
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,340
The observation time is not long enough.

462
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,420
There's no need to say things like drug companies are leaving themselves a way out.

463
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,636
What is your own opinion?

464
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:18,501
After all, the sample size was several times larger.

465
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,540
It's possible that the results were diluted.

466
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,200
You mean that the result of Phase III is inaccurate?

467
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,620
No. I mean that the result of Phase II may have some bias.

468
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,000
Where did the bias occur?

469
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,400
In the results of the Phase II clinical trial, how is the enrolled patient's course of disease represented?

470
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,280
Median.

471
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,420
In the clinical trial of phase III, what is the inclusion criteria based on?

472
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,800
This is in the supplementary materials.

473
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,180
I only read the main text.

474
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,460
You spent 8 hours on 10 articles.

475
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,720
Each paper took an average of 40 minutes.

476
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,000
What have you been reading?

477
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,071
Whether it is the main text or a supplement,

478
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:08,740
all of its contents are very useful and important for evaluating a study.

479
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,625
Why can't you give me an answer?

480
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:14,350
Sorry, Professor Gu. I'll make it up today.

481
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,300
Professor Gu, I know you're always strict.

482
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,960
But Classmate Su didn't even finish graduate school.

483
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,220
It is her first day working here, and you assigned her so many tasks.

484
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,100
I think she's already doing pretty well.

485
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,800
Compared to others, she is doing pretty well.

486
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,600
But her ability is far more than that.

487
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,800
Doing things like this can't be forgiven at all.

488
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,620
Su Wei'an, if you don't show your real abilities,

489
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,680
you'll just keep being criticized for relying on your connections.

490
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,700
Yes, Professor Gu.

491
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,260
Before getting off work today, I'll go through it carefully, including the supplementary materials.

492
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,500
I had to wait in a long line to buy this.

493
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,320
Boss, you must have learned face-changing.

494
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,560
After work, you're a completely different person.

495
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,440
What do you mean, "Boss"?

496
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,260
You are the boss.

497
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,920
I wouldn't dare.

498
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,460
You bossed around when you assigned work.

499
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,600
It scared me, and I'm still shaking.

500
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
What kind of boss does that?

501
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,300
I'll help you deal with him.

502
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,560
I thought you were mad because I criticized you like that in public.

503
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,540
Am I that stupid?

504
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,140
I know you are helping me.

505
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,580
And it was indeed the retest that led to the rectification of the paper.

506
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,400
It's normal that people are mad at me.

507
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,170
But, the stricter you are with me, the more they'll sympathize with me.

508
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,230
Yes, but not exactly.

509
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,980
What do you mean?

510
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,720
You really want to criticize me?

511
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,150
Let's talk at home.

512
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,720
Eat first, then talk.

513
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,300
Talk first, then eat.

514
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,880
Wei'an, why do I make you read those articles?

515
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,480
To keep up with all the research developments?

516
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,920
What is our goal?

517
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,220
To prove the problem with HDQ39 and its connection with aneurysms.

518
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,160
That's right.

519
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:01,310
Have you thought about why studies on drugs of the same type with similar mechanisms always fail in Phase III clinical trials?

520
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:08,220
In this situation, rather than all the crowning arguments in the paper,

521
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,960
shouldn't we understand what they are really doing?

522
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,700
Shouldn't you learn all the supplementary materials?

523
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,300
I should.

524
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,920
I didn't think this through.

525
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,720
Then starting from tonight,

526
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,540
let's read through these ten papers together, word by word.

527
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,920
Find a breakthrough in the paper to design the experiment.

528
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
So much work.

529
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,920
I shouldn't have fallen in love with the teacher.

530
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,180
There are endless review materials and endless tests every day.

531
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,300
What?

532
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,960
Are you afraid?

533
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,060
It's too late for regrets now.

534
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,000
Do you think other couples are the same as us?

535
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,640
Working on their careers day and night?

536
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,920
If you don't want to work,

537
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,840
do you want to do something else?

538
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,400
Let's eat.

539
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm addicted to my studies.

540
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,160
Let's eat.

541
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,360
Here, broccoli.

542
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,320
Mom!

543
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,480
You're back.

544
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,260
Why did you call me back so urgently?

545
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,900
Where's Dad?

546
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,740
Don't drink that.

547
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,460
This is pear and white wood ear soup I just made. Here you go.

548
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,480
You all are so busy.

549
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,760
No one can stay by my side.

550
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,960
If you have something to say, just say it.

551
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,520
I heard that Xiao Ran didn't get the research assistant position she applied for.

552
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,480
She can't stay at the hospital either.

553
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,460
How about letting her join Jiehui?

554
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,480
Why are you getting involved in the company's operations?

555
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,560
I know you two broke up.

556
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,200
And there's a problem with the project Professor Wen is researching.

557
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,680
But Xiao Ran's heart for you has never changed.

558
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,600
Besides, your company needs someone like Xiao Ran

559
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
who knows what's best for you.

560
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,280
She can help you solve tough problems.

561
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,760
Tough problems?

562
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,400
Yuncheng, I told you so.

563
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,080
How can we let go of our three-year relationship so easily?

564
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,560
Xiao Ran, I heard that

565
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,920
you didn't get the research assistant position in the end.

566
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,000
Jiehui is in need of a marketing manager right now.

567
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
Come to the company and help me.

568
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:48,000
Yuncheng, the reason I interviewed for the research assistant position is that no matter when,

569
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,160
as long as you needed me, I can be by your side.

570
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,160
I just didn't expect to get set up by Su Wei'an.

571
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,220
When I video-chatted with her back then, I asked her what to do if there are too many false positives after staining.

572
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,880
She didn't mention the antibodies at all back then.

573
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,460
She set me up on purpose.

574
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,040
None of this matters. I know your abilities.

575
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,120
It's just that the company has requirements for performance reviews.

576
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,360
They can't lower the standards just because I introduced you.

577
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,220
You can understand, right?

578
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,360
Of course.

579
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,600
I don't need any special treatment.

580
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:31,880
As long as I can watch you from a distance at the company, I'll be satisfied.

581
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,980
Yuncheng, I know you loved Su Wei'an in the past.

582
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,900
If you see her again, it'll be hard for you to let go.

583
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,780
But she is Gu Yunzheng's girlfriend now.

584
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,960
Can we still...

585
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,560
Xiao Ran.

586
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,780
I've put a lot of effort into HDQ39.

587
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,660
You've seen that over the years.

588
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,300
Now there's so much negative news surrounding the company.

589
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,620
It's still unclear whether or not this drug can make it to the market.

590
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:05,000
If it's not handled well,  it will be a fatal blow to Jiehui.

591
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,880
So, I'm not in the mood to think about anything else right now.

592
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,160

593
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,840
The unblinded results show that

594
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,740
the three patients who experienced adverse reactions were all taking HDQ39,

595
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,765
and not the placebo.

596
00:39:35,765 --> 00:39:39,040
How do you explain this?

597
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,020
Professor, less than 10 percent of the samples were lost.

598
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,940
It will not affect the launch of HDQ39.

599
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,380
We haven't figured out the side effects of this drug yet.

600
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,700
Can it be launched so rashly?

601
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,840
As long as the process is in compliance, the launch won't be affected.

602
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,340
Prepare materials right now to submit a report to the Ethics Committee.

603
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,920
Let them make the decision.

604
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,350
Professor.

605
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,980
The patients experienced adverse events after they withdrew from the trial.

606
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,560
We don't have to report it.

607
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,970
Xiao Yang,

608
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,860
don't forget we are doctors.

609
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,480
We consider the patient's health as the top priority, not anything else.

610
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,520
I researched HDQ39 to relieve the symptoms of Huntington's disease,

611
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,020
not to pursue profits from it going to market.

612
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,900
You... The way you're talking now doesn't seem like you're a doctor from Zhang He Hospital, but an employee of Jiehui.

613
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,160
- Professor— 
 - Tell me.

614
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,740
What benefits did Jiehui Company give you?

615
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,400
Professor!

616
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,560
I admit, I am a bit impatient.

617
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,570
But that's because I don't want to see our years of hard work go to waste.

618
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,280
There really is no benefit transfer between me and Jiehui.

619
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
If you don't believe me,

620
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,740
you can ask Miss Wen.

621
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,220
She is an employee of Jiehui now.

622
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,620
What did you say?

623
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,980

624
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
Dad, you are back.

625
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,000
Old Wen,

626
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,760
have some water.

627
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,960
Xiao Ran, why did you join Jiehui without letting us know?

628
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,860
I'm not interested in clinical practice.

629
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,940
I want to do scientific research.

630
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,420
Yuncheng happens to have a job opening.

631
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,520
Jiehui is also a big company.

632
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,660
Xiao Ran, didn't you say earlier that you were going to apply for the research assistant position at Huaren?

633
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,080
Yes. I considered it.

634
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,800
I think Jiehui's pay is better than Huaren's.

635
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,400
Are you unwilling to work there, or are you unable to?

636
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,560
I have already figured out the whole story of how you got to Jiehui.

637
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,800
Did you know?

638
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,720
Your daughter was fired by Huaren.

639
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,280
Xiao Ran, is that true?

640
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,270
What's going on?

641
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,900
No, Dad. It was that Su Wei'an.

642
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,400
She just had to compete with me for the research assistant position.

643
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,300
She just wanted to prove that there's an issue with HDQ39.

644
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,440
She's up to no good.

645
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,820
Xiao Ran, why are you still lying?

646
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,780
That paper was published in a journal with an impact factor of six back then, Su Wei'an was the primary author.

647
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:10,020

648
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,100
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

649
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,260
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

656
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:57,180
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

657
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,260
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

658

♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

659
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,500
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫
