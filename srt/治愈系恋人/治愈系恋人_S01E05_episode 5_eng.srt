00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,980

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,980

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,480
Hurry up and leave, there's a situation.

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,940
Hi.

18
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,890
General Kouyate is here. He brought a group of armed soldiers as well.

19
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,080

20
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,060
What's the point? It's just two boxes of alcohol.

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,840

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,820
I need to see the General.

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,720
General, I lost the alcohol.

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,540
I'll pay you back. Please don't cause trouble in the hospital.

25
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,420
What are you trying to do here?

26
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,620
This is my fault, so I'll take responsibility.

27
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,800
Little girl, you really know how to find good places to hide.

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,480
General, you can speak Chinese?

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,770
The General attended military school in Shijiazhuang before. He even knows the local dialect.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,467
You bad girl, do you know the consequences of selling me fake alcohol?

31
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,420
Fake alcohol?

32
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,320
That's impossible. I never sell fake alcohol.

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,720
Maybe you changed the alcohol yourself so that you can claim that it's fake.

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm an honorable General, so why would I need to frame you?

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,660
You arrogant girl, we'll settle this issue later.

36
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,060
Right now, I'm not here for you, but for him.

37
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,400
Wait, General, but you've already been examined.

38
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
There's no tumors and no bleeding spots. How can you prove that you're sick?

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,060
My instincts are never wrong. It's up to him to prove it.

40
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,020
General, why are you insisting that you're sick?

41
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,400
General, why are you insisting that you're sick?

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,380
Back in the day, from this position,

43
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,580
I could shoot you in the head with one shot while you're standing downstairs.

44
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,000
But now I can't.

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,840
It could also be that your eyesight has deteriorated or your age—

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,100
In any case, you should consult with your primary doctor.

47
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,620

48
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,820
Eliot?

49
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,240
I'm not afraid to die.

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,100
What I'm afraid of is not knowing who my enemy is until I die.

51
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,660
Eliot has no guts. What about you?

52
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,620
If you don't help me figure out the problem in my brain, I'll kill her.

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,720
Selling fake alcohol is a serious crime in Lakaya,

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,860
and now I suspect that it's her fake alcohol that's causing my headaches.

55
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,300
I didn't sell fake alcohol.

56
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,300
Put the gun down. I can do surgery for you,

57
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,180
but can you trust me with your life?

58
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm not afraid of bullets. Not to mention a scalpel.

59
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,460
But of course,

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,040
if you dare to make any moves, don't expect to leave the operating room alive.

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,250
Fine.

62
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,740
I'll do the surgery for you in a month.

63
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,600
I... will definitely find your enemy.

64
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,210
Good. I found the right guy.

65
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,300
You're a good doctor.

66
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,700
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

67
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Why did you promise the General that?

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,460
The hospital has already examined him, and it's clearly written in the medical records that there are no problems.

69
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,320
Or did you promise to do the surgery just to dispel his suspicions?

70
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,720
It's not because the General threatened to kill me if you didn't agree, right?

71
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,160
You can't be that foolish, right?

72
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,340
If I buy a ticket and return to China or go to another country, there's nothing he can do to me.

73
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,380
Dr. Gu. What will you do if you still can't find any problems after the surgery?

74
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,220
This will then be seen as a major case of medical malpractice,

75
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,320
and you might not even be able to be a doctor anymore.

76
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,140
You can't take this risk.

77
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
Su Wei'an.

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,700
You're really worried about me, aren't you?

79
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,120
Not at all.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,140
I... I'm just afraid that you'll get me in trouble.

81
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,000
If the surgery fails, because I'm an interpreter, I won't be able to escape.

82
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,820
Wait, but why do you just have to do this surgery?

83
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,220
Because someone will die if I don't do it.

84
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,060
Do you know what the General's illness is?

85
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,070
What I mean is, if I don't do it, I'll die.

86
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,420
Do you think the two of us would be able to leave this room alive if I didn't agree to do the surgery?

87
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,580
Do you think the two of us would be able to leave this room alive if I didn't agree to do the surgery?

88
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,760
Then... why don't you buy a ticket back to China?

89
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,833
I'll help you stall for time.

90
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,553
The General can't chase you in China.

91
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,120
Su Wei'an. Do you not trust me?

92
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,500
I trust science.

93
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,500
The CT scan and MRI both confirmed that there's nothing wrong.

94
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
General Kouyate isn't sick.

95
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,320
You are...

96
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,540
I'm Eliot, General Kouyate's attending physician.

97
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,560
Eliot... You know Chinese?

98
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,320
My grandmother is from Beijing. I learned a little bit from her.

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,300
I've heard about you. You're Dr. Gu Yunzheng from Huaren Hospital.

100
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,860
Do you no longer want to keep your zero-fatality record in the operating room?

101
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,178
Zero fatalities on the operating table. It's a record to be proud of.

102
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:16,440
It shows that Dr. Gu is still too young and has done too few surgeries.

103
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,620
Newcomers are always eager to prove themselves, and I can understand that, Dr. Gu.

104
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,700
But patients aren't bargaining chips for doctors to gain fame and fortune.

105
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,800
Who said so?

106
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,360
The number of Dr. Gu's weekly outpatient visits and operations in China far exceeds those of doctors like you.

107
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,540
In terms of clinical experience, you may not be better than him.

108
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,500
Is that so? What does a patient like you know about clinical experience?

109
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,160
General Kouyate has always been my patient.

110
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,500
The diagnosis was based on a remote consultation with a French group of experts.

111
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,840
May I ask why, with a diagnosis that found no abnormalities,

112
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,960
is Dr. Gu insisting on doing this surgery? Is he trying to provoke the National Hospital of France?

113
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,140
Dr. Eliot.

114
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,220
Your hospital really isn't that important to me.

115
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,500
I just want to give this patient the best medical treatment.

116
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,260
Now, I'm the patient's attending physician.

117
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,200
Dr. Gu, if you insist on doing this surgery,

118
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,180
I'll invite experts from the Lakaya Health Commission to supervise the whole process.

119
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,740
Dr. Gu, I'm warning you.

120
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,257
If it's proven afterward that you performed a fake surgery,

121
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:44,600
I'll sue you until you can never pick up a scalpel again.

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
Aggressive young lady, I hope you didn't pick the wrong person.

123
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,500
Damn poker face.

124
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,180
His nose is in the air.

125
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
Stop looking.

126
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,140
He already left.

127
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,820
He's so handsome.

128
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,660
As handsome as an ancient Roman sculpture.

129
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,760
What's the use in being handsome?

130
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,500
The patient still switched over to our Boss.

131
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:30,317
Do you know him?

132
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,500
He's General Kouyate's attending physician.

133
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,220
I've asked around.

134
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,720
He's the head of Neurosurgery at the National Hospital of France,

135
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,960
and also a professor of neurosurgery at Paris VI University.

136
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,120
He can be considered an authority in neurosurgery.

137
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,220
An authority?

138
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,860
Then who's better, him or Dr. Gu?

139
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,740
Actually, it's hard to say.

140
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,500
Paris VI University is the largest scientific and medical collective in France.

141
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,200
Paris VI University is the largest scientific and medical collective in France.

142
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,700
It's also one of the top five research universities in the world.

143
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,640
The authority has already said that General Kouyate isn't sick.

144
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,120
Why does he keep insisting on finding a problem?

145
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,080
I also hope Boss finds a reason to politely decline.

146
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,500
These people are armed and dangerous.

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,540
And not to be messed with.

148
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,400
What if the treatment fails?

149
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Bullets don't discriminate.

150
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,560
Then what do we do?

151
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,460
Has Dr. Gu changed his mind now?

152
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,240

153
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
What are you doing?

154
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,560
Join the fight if my oppositions fail.

155
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,100
Search for references and help guard Boss's zero fatalities on the operating table record.

156
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,400
Zero fatalities on the operating table?

157
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,340
Is it a competition? Is it impressive?

158
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,420
Maybe it's a competition with oneself.

159
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,080
Which doctor doesn’t want zero fatalities on their operating table?

160
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,880
Then what about you?

161
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,020
I...

162
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,400
I didn't keep a record.

163
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,020
Hurry and help me find it.

164
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm running out of time. I have to finish reading all of this tonight.

165
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,720
This...

166
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,680
There's so much.

167
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,420
How long will it take us to finish?

168
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,740
For the two of us, an all-nighter should be enough.

169
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
For the two of us, an all-nighter should be enough.

170
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,300
An all-nighter?

171
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,220
No way! Staying up all night will give me acne.

172
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,420
This isn't it.

173
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Let's just do it.

174
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,000
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

175
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,640
Can you read surgical records?

176
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,940
What should I focus on?

177
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,820
Focus on...

178
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,400
Never mind.

179
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,600
Can you understand the shadows and masses in this CT scan image?

180
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,800
Am I really useless?

181
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,560
No, of course not.

182
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,300
To me, you're very useful.

183
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,140
Help me... sort these research paper abstracts.

184
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,160
I'll tell you how to do it.

185
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Take this one, for example.

186
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,700
Put it together with others that are the same,

187
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,020
and put them over here, and then this one...

188
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,340

189
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,380

190
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
What is it?

191
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,580
 Why are you doing surgery on a patient without knowing the cause of their illness?

192
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,000
 Why are you doing surgery on a patient without knowing the cause of their illness?

193
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,880
You already found out?

194
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,060
You can't do this surgery.

195
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,080
You can't do this surgery.

196
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,020
I've already sent a letter to Friendship Hospital.

197
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,340
 They'll communicate with the patient about canceling the surgery.

198
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,190
In what capacity are you giving me orders?

199
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,180
As the director? Or my father?

200
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,080
No matter what capacity it is, I'm doing this for your own good.

201
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,320
That patient is a local dignitary.

202
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,780
 What if something goes wrong with your surgery?

203
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,420
Do you want to end up like your mom?

204
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
You don't deserve to talk about her.

205
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
Let me tell you again.

206
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,060
Listen carefully.

207
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,100
She abandoned us first back then.

208
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,420
You were the one who abandoned her first.

209
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,654
 We encounter various diseases every day,

210
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,380
 and as a doctor, the most painful thing is being helpless in the face of a disease.

211
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,740
 and as a doctor, the most painful thing is being helpless in the face of a disease.

212
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,860
 and as a doctor, the most painful thing is being helpless in the face of a disease.

213
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,140
 So I hope that all the students here

214
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,360
 will never take this kind of pain for granted, never give up easily,

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,320
 will never take this kind of pain for granted, never give up easily,

216
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,620
 and will always encourage each other.

217
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,140
 All right. That's it for today, class dismissed.

218
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,120
 Wei'an.

219
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,180
 Su Wei'an.

220
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,980
 What's up?

221
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,320
 You like Professor Gu.

222
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,960
 No.

223
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,480
 Don't make such a joke.

224
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,860
 No? You're acting all smitten.

225
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,700
 No wonder you kept asking questions in class today.

226
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,840
 Were you trying to get Professor Gu's attention?

227
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,200
 No.

228
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,380
 When did you start liking him?

229
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,060
 You fell in love with him when he helped you out that time when you were late for the final exam, right?

230
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
 You fell in love with him when he helped you out that time when you were late for the final exam, right?

231
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,320
 It's not that I like him.

232
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,460
 It's that I want to be him.

233
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
General, I advise you to think twice. You can't fool around with your life.

234
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,020
General, I advise you to think twice. You can't fool around with your life.

235
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,380
- General! 
 - You can't go in, Madam.

236
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,920
General, here's two boxes of Moutai.

237
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,880
General, here's two boxes of Moutai.

238
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,360
Double compensation.

239
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,140
Is it enough?

240
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,580
If not, I can add more.

241
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,940
This taste is spot on.

242
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,820
As you Chinese say,

243
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,120
don't climb the Three Treasures Pavilion without a reason. 
  (TN: One should avoid unnecessary involvement or meddling without a good reason.)

244
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,680
General,

245
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,880
please give up on the surgery.

246
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,500
Is Gu Yunzheng afraid?

247
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,440
He even sent a woman to beg for mercy.

248
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,080
No, he has no idea I'm here.

249
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,580
General, there are many possible reasons for your abnormal condition.

250
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,860
Surgery might not even be necessary.

251
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,400
General, Miss Su is right.

252
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,980
I'll go with you to the Paris Main Hospital next month.

253
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,240
They have the most advanced equipment in the world. You can get checked again there.

254
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,300
Get out of here!

255
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,200
It's already been a year.

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,580
I know there's a time bomb buried inside me, but you just can't find it.

257
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,320
I know there's a time bomb buried inside me, but you just can't find it.

258
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
So we can only surrender?

259
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,520
What does Gu Yunzheng say?

260
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,580
He isn't giving up, just like you.

261
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,560
He even said that in the face of disease, doctors and patients should be on the same side.

262
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,540
He even said that in the face of disease, doctors and patients should be on the same side.

263
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
To Dr. Gu.

264
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,600
You Chinese also say, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cubs?" 
  (TN: No pain, no gain.)

265
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,940
You Chinese also say, "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger's cubs?" 
  (TN: No pain, no gain.)

266
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,020
General, what does it take to get you to give up the surgery?

267
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,980
General, what does it take to get you to give up the surgery?

268
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,240
Miss Su, don't you want my surgery to be successful?

269
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,680
Miss Su, don't you want my surgery to be successful?

270
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,300
Destroying the enemy and living a long and healthy life.

271
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,000
Destroying the enemy and living a long and healthy life.

272
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,060
I can drink more alcohol, and you can make more money.

273
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,580
I can drink more alcohol, and you can make more money.

274
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,520
I don't want money.

275
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,080
I just don't want anything to happen to Dr. Gu.

276
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,180
Are you still that money-obsessed Miss Su?

277
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:23,600
Dr. Gu is one of the best neurosurgeons in China.

278
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
Are you sure you want to jeopardize a doctor's career for your own reasons?

279
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,440
Are you sure you want to jeopardize a doctor's career for your own reasons?

280
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,440
If he really is as good as you say, why do you think he'll lose?

281
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,460
If he really is as good as you say, why do you think he'll lose?

282
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,640
Because you're actually not sick at all.

283
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,970
Do you know that this condition you have is called hypochondria in psychology?

284
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,880
- Miss Su. 
 - You should go see a psychologist, not Dr. Gu!

285
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,170
- Miss Su. 
 - You should go see a psychologist, not Dr. Gu!

286
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,640
How dare you?!

287
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,250
- Get her out of here! 
 - General.

288
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,820
- General. 
 - Let go.

289
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,480
General, she's drunk. She didn't mean to offend you.

290
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,270
Miss Su, please stop talking. I'll take you home.

291
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,470
General.

292
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,240
Let Dr. Gu take this crazy woman back.

293
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,740
- Yes, Sir! 
 - Yes, Sir.

294
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,740
Hello?

295
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,790
 Come to the General's residence and take this crazy lady away.

296
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,130
 Come to the General's residence and take this crazy lady away.

297
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,220
 She's had too much to drink.

298
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,060
Okay, I understand.

299
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,580
This idiot.

300
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,220
This Dr. Gu, who is he to you?

301
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,580
He...

302
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,520
He is my...

303
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,940
Boyfriend?

304
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,760
No!

305
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,990
He's over there.

306
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,080
And I'm here.

307
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,320
He's my professor,

308
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,360
the one I admire the most,

309
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,220
and the person I used to want to be.

310
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,440
Why "used to?"

311
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
I...

312
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,720
I'm not that lucky.

313
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,420
The way you are right now reminds me of my mentor.

314
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,830
She also sighed like this often and complained to God.

315
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,880
She also sighed like this often and complained to God.

316
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,900
She loved to play dice in her lab.

317
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,120
Did your mentor also have trouble with her experiments?

318
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,360
Did your mentor also have trouble with her experiments?

319
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,680
It's because she always chose the road less traveled.

320
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,980
Even though she failed often,

321
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,680
Dr. Marta is still the most amazing doctor I've ever known.

322
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
Dr. Marta is still the most amazing doctor I've ever known.

323
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,240
Dr. Marta?

324
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,630
The Dr. Marta who was the first in the world to try to use cell transplantation to treat Huntington's disease?

325
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,100
The Dr. Marta who was the first in the world to try to use cell transplantation to treat Huntington's disease?

326
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,780
The Dr. Marta who was the first in the world to try to use cell transplantation to treat Huntington's disease?

327
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,780
How do you know?

328
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,985
This was her experiment on a rare disease more than 20 years ago.

329
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:29,505
You probably weren't even born yet at that time.

330
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,760
Su Wei'an.

331
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Thank you.

332
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,620
Dr. Eliot, it's getting late.

333
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,520
We'll go back to the hospital first. Bye.

334
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,300
Dr. Gu.

335
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,260
Dr. Gu, why are you so determined to do this surgery?

336
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,340
Dr. Gu, why are you so determined to do this surgery?

337
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,980
Because doctors should never ignore any signals from the patient.

338
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,220
Because doctors should never ignore any signals from the patient.

339
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,260

340
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,940
 Let's keep drinking!

341
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,140
Either you or I have to get drunk today.

342
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,540
Either you or I have to get drunk today.

343
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,500
You're still thinking about drinking.

344
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,890
Why on earth did you go to the General's house for a drink tonight?

345
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,520
Why on earth did you go to the General's house for a drink tonight?

346
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,080
It's all because you're a troublemaker and you give me no peace of mind.

347
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,100
It's all because you're a troublemaker and you give me no peace of mind.

348
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,680
Who's the troublemaker here?

349
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,260
It's the middle of the night, and I had to go to the General's house to pick you up.

350
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,620
Eliot.

351
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,220
Hurry and help me plead with the General.

352
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,415
Su Wei'an. Can you please stay away from that Eliot in the future?

353
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,740
Su Wei'an. Can you please stay away from that Eliot in the future?

354
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,930
Why? He's a good person.

355
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,780
Because you're my interpreter, and not Eliot's.

356
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,620
Just rest here tonight and clear your head.

357
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,100
Just rest here tonight and clear your head.

358
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,660
Don't go.

359
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,300
 These facial features are too ordinary.

360
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,120
 These facial features are too ordinary.

361
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,920
 These facial features are too ordinary.

362
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,840
Fang Mingfan!

363
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,000
What are you trying to do?

364
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

365
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,900
What kind of person?

366
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,780
Your face, wipe it.

367
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,670
Oh no! I didn't remove my makeup all night. This is a disaster.

368
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,780
Oh no! I didn't remove my makeup all night. This is a disaster.

369
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,820
A hundred face masks won't even make up for this.

370
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,000
Paper!

371
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,820
Fang Mingfan, I'm warning you. You can't tell anyone.

372
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,940
Tell anyone what?

373
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,200
You can't tell anyone that my makeup got ruined, and also that I spent a night with you here.

374
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,100
You can't tell anyone that my makeup got ruined, and also that I spent a night with you here.

375
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,240
Who would I tell?

376
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,220
You. This...

377
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,200
Anyways, just don't tell anyone, okay?

378
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
If you tell anybody, I won't spare you.

379
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,420
- Okay. 
 - Don't laugh.

380
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,060
Jiang Jiang.

381
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,220
Actually, even with your ruined makeup, you're pretty.

382
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,940
You're so early.

383
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,940
Why are you wearing the same clothes as yesterday?

384
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,400
Aren't you also?

385
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,520
I woke up very early this morning and went for a workout.

386
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
I woke up very early this morning and went for a workout.

387
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,320
I...

388
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,060
I went to make some money and talked business with a big client.

389
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,520
I went to make some money and talked business with a big client.

390
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,420
You've been drinking. Who were you drinking with?

391
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,280

392
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,400
Have you found a direction for the surgery?

393
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,300
Did you sober up? Does your head still hurt?

394
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,300
Then let's go and have breakfast together.

395
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,780
You still have the mood to eat breakfast?

396
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,920
You were in the mood to drink so much, so why can't I eat?

397
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,420
- I... 
 - I know. You did that for me.

398
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:51,200
You were afraid my reputation would be ruined. But Su Wei'an, let me ask you something.

399
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,720
Why do you think I want to do this surgery for General Kouyate?

400
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,710
How would I know?

401
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,800
Is it because the General pointed a gun at you, or because you wanted to compete with Eliot?

402
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,205
Su Wei'an.

403
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:16,225
I'm a doctor, and we only have one reason for doing surgery for a patient.

404
00:31:16,225 --> 00:31:20,883
And it's that the patient meets the surgical indications and must undergo surgery.

405
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:24,260
- Why don't you believe me? 
 - I believe you.

406
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,045
But I've looked through all the cases with unclear imaging that I could find, and there's nothing similar to the General's.

407
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:34,400
So you just gave up?

408
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,860
Did Huaren Medical University only teach you how to give up?

409
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,900
- What are you saying? 
 - You're foolish indeed. No wonder you're an undergrad.

410
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,580
I'm not an undergrad. I have a bachelor's degree.

411
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,760
A bachelor's degree?

412
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,960
Everything that Professor Gu taught you in your college classes, I guess you've forgotten it all.

413
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,240
I really don’t know how you managed to get your bachelor's degree.

414
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,880
 Students, during this class,

415
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,160
 we're going to talk about diagnostic ideas of brain tumors that are based on practice.

416
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,460
 It's clear that there are no obvious lesions in the patient’s CT scan.

417
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,660
 But let's take a look at the MRI again.

418
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,860
 We can clearly see lesions present on the patient's brainstem, right?

419
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:39,460
 Professor Gu, if there are no obvious abnormalities on the MRI, then what should the doctor do?

420
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,600
 They should do a clinical follow-up,

421
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,400
 and based on experience, judge the progression rate of the disease to determine the follow-up schedule.

422
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,700
 Then should doctors trust clinical experience or precise instruments?

423
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,560
 When a doctor treats diseases,

424
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,900
 they use guidelines as the criterion, knowledge as the basis, and experience as the tool.

425
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,020
 And with rigorous examination results, we can determine

426
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,980
 specific lesions efficiently and accurately to avoid delays and misdiagnosis.

427
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,880
 So I hope everyone will keep this in mind.

428
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,420
 Only by utilizing the instruments and developing your own clinical thinking, can you be truly responsible for patients.

429
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,020
You remember me.

430
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,200
So you kept asking questions in class because you wanted me to remember you?

431
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,300
Of course not.

432
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:33,620
It's a question that you yourself asked, and you forgot the answer.

433
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,960
Utilize the instruments. But, how are you sure that there'll be visible abnormalities in a month?

434
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,360
What characteristics did the patient have when walking?

435
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,460
Swaggering, unsteady, and shuffling.

436
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,980
Which diseases do these symptoms usually indicate?

437
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Drunkenness, lower limb weakness, or cerebellar ataxia.

438
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,660
What are the characteristics of the patient’s speech?

439
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,900
His speech was slurred and he had difficulty speaking. Dysarthria.

440
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,360
What was his main complaint?

441
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,530
 I could shoot you in the head with one shot while you're standing downstairs. But now I can't.

442
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,860
His marksmanship declined.

443
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,060
His limb flexibility decreased.

444
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,620
So?

445
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,900
So the lesion may be in...

446
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,860
in the brainstem.

447
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,940
Not bad. You didn't completely forget everything.

448
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:45,060
Imaging technology is so advanced now. How could we have missed the lesions completely?

449
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,480
It could be because of its odd position, or because the disease is in its early stages.

450
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:59,160
But anyways, doctors like us cannot ignore any weak signals coming from a patient's body.

451
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,520
General, the MRI already shows that there are abnormal signals in your brainstem.

452
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,550
Leave the rest to Dr. Gu. Please trust him.

453
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,840
You'll destroy the enemy?

454
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,640
- Why are you guys here? 
 - I represent the local health commission.

455
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,100
I'll be supervising today's surgery.

456
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:30,100
The MRI already shows that there are abnormal signals in the brainstem.

457
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,920
After this, you will witness the superb medical skills of Chinese doctors.

458
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,920
Su.

459
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,540
Gu Yunzheng is so young, and he dares to do brainstem surgery?

460
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,460
Then you're wrong. We should trust Dr. Gu.

461
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,650

462
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,740
General!

463
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,480
- What are you doing? 
 - I want to go in. Wherever the General is, I'll be there.

464
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,680
He said he wants to be wherever the General is.

465
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,560
Let him in then.

466
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,720
The doctor said you can go in, but you have to obey the sterility rules in the operating room. Let's go.

467
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,920
Boss, wherever you are, I'll be there. I'll even die with you.

468
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
As long as your hands don't shake, no one will die.

469
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,400
- You... 
 - Die with you? Then my life would be too sad.

470
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,160
It's been so long already. Can he really do it?

471
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,520
I told you before that he's not capable of doing brainstem surgery.

472
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,540
Dr. Gu insisted on risking the General’s life.

473
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,439
Irreversible damage hasn't settled in yet, so it's not too late to close his head.

474
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,040
The surgery isn't over yet. Don't jump to conclusions.

475
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,187
His blood pressure is dropping.

476
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:28,407
The blood pressure is dropping.

477
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,900
Dr. Gu, put down your scalpel immediately. Otherwise, I'll hold you responsible for medical malpractice on behalf of the Health Commission.

478
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,340
Hand it over to Dr. Eliot right now.

479
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,160
Get out of the way or I'll kill you.

480
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,520
Step aside now!

481
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,180
Don't even think about getting closer to Dr. Gu. Unless I'm dead.

482
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,840
No one can stop Dr. Gu’s surgery. No one can interfere with the lead surgeon.

483
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,080
Miss Su, you're just an interpreter. You're not qualified to make comments regarding surgery.

484
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,360
It isn't too late to stop now.

485
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,000
I graduated from Huaren Medical University, studying clinical medicine.

486
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,055
I have a medical certificate. I'll take responsibility for every word I say.

487
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,820
If anything goes wrong, none of you will live.

488
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,860
The lesion is in the medulla oblongata.

489
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,787
The lesion is in the medulla oblongata.

490
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:47,007
This is unbelievable.

491
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Did you guys see it clearly?

492
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,040
You all should consider apologizing to Dr. Gu.

493
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,460
Record these numbers.

494
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,240
Why isn't the General waking up yet? It’s been so long since the surgery ended.

495
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,980
You can't leave, you quacks!

496
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,934
The General won't wake up so fast, but the operation was very successful.

497
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:31,640
Dr. Gu did a perfect job. The lesion was also perfectly removed. I underestimated him.

498
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,062
You were wrong?

499
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,140
Dr. Eliot.

500
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:52,851
You promised just now.

501
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,440
Dr. Gu is an excellent doctor, just like you said.

502
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,380
I apologize for all my previous actions.

503
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,520
Dr. Gu, I'm sorry.

504
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,960
You are also worried about the patient's safety. When the biopsy report comes out, we'll notify you right away.

505
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
Thanks.

506
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
What should I do?

507
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,000
What is it now?

508
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,640
In the operating room just now, you once again risked your life to protect me.

509
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,960
Tell me.

510
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,960
I owe a girl two lives, so how should I pay her back?

511
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,080
This wasn't the case, don't overthink it.

512
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,540
You stepped in front of a gun for me. Can I not overthink it?

513
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,460
Just now, you told the Health Commission's representative

514
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,460
that I was your idol and you're willing to die for me.

515
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,260
 Idol?

516
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,700
I understood everything, and I was very touched.

517
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,060
When did I say something like that? Don’t pretend to understand.

518
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,400
You didn't say that? Then maybe I heard the voice of your heart.

519
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,740
Su Wei'an.

520
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,960
Don't joke with your life anymore.

521
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,060
You can't risk your own life. Not even for me.

522
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,220
If you're alive, you can save a few more lives.

523
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,780
Exchanging my life for yours is worth it.

524
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,700
I told you. Don't say such things again.

525
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,180
No one's life is more valuable than someone else's.

526
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,160
W-Wait a minute.

527
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,360
What? Recognize your mistake?

528
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,420
Didn't you just say that you're worried about how to repay me?

529
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,440
Give me a pay raise.

530
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,520
Su Wei'an! You really want money more than your life, don't you?

531
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,001
Did you know that the gun from earlier didn't even have the safety catch pulled?

532
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:11,010

533
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,950
