 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,060
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,540
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,390
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,220
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,280
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,380
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:23,820
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,980

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:37,680
But compared to an exciting life, what I prefer is a calm and lasting one.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,220
Well, you don't have to push yourself too hard.

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,620
Just relax and be yourself.

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,140
But I don't have time for that.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,800
Why?

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,900
I... I need to earn money to support my family.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,140
My dad passed away and my mom retired.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm the only one supporting the family.

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,260
I have to take care of my mom's pension and handle our loans.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,030
How can a little person like you have so much to worry about?

26
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,480
I really wish I had an iron.

27
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,220
So next time you frown, I can smooth out the wrinkles.

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,980
I don't want my junior to look like a little old lady at such a young age.

29
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,000
Then I have to thank you first.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,160
This way, I can save some money on facial masks.

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,640
Pharmaceutical representatives earn a lot.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,780
Do you want to consider joining my company?

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,080
Forget it.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
Domestic competition is too fierce, I can't handle it.

35
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,300
You must remember that I'm always behind you.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,220
I'll always be your strongest supporter.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,540
Thanks, Senior.

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,020
You've always had your own rhythm, just like your performance earlier.

39
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,660
And I can only try my best to keep up with your beat.

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,060
Senior, keep your own rhythm.

41
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,600
Don't change it because of me.

42
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,600
I hope that one day, you'll be the CEO of China's biggest pharmaceutical company.

43
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,800
Even if you're not a doctor, you can still be on Huaren Medical University's honorary alumni list, right?

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,220
Let me take this call.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,940
Hello?

46
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,820

47
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,780
Mom, calm down first. Which hospital?

48
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,460
Huaren?

49
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,460
It's okay. I'm on my way.

50
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,620
To Huaren Hospital, please.

51
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,540
Hello, Professor Gu.

52
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,860
Xiao Zhang, do you know who in our department is on duty for emergencies tonight?

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,740
Professor He Xiaoguang and Wen Ran.

54
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,140
Why are you so excited?

55
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,500
Guess who's coming?

56
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,980
Don't beat around the bush. Just tell me.

57
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,280
Su Wei'an, the female student who reported Professor He and Wen Ran back then.

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,670
Really?

59
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,820
What a small world.

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,780
The emergency department will be quite a spectacle tonight.

61
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,680
Who did you say? Su Wei'an?

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,080
Today, her relative came to our emergency department.

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,020
Professor He and Wen Ran are on duty.

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,620
No.

65
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,380
The tendon reflex wouldn't be hyperactive like this.

66
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,060
Now, we should perform a differential diagnosis to rule out more serious illnesses.

67
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,300
The patient's family said that this symptom occurs regularly.

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,260
- It can go away on its own. 
 - Yes.

69
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,440
This is indeed just a fluctuation in the symptoms of chorea.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,780
This is very likely to be a symptom of a new illness.

71
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,460
Do you think I'm medically illiterate?

72
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,700
Do you think you aren't? Who's the doctor here, you or me?

73
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,640
You've only learned the basics for a few days, and now you're showing off?

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,980
Wei'an, we completely understand how you feel.

75
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,740
But you're not a doctor after all.

76
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,340
You should trust the doctor's judgment.

77
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,100
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

78
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,180
Why would anyone wish for their relative to be seriously ill?

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,640
I've only learned the basics, but I know we should perform a differential diagnosis now.

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,300
You're sending the patient home after simply glancing at her.

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,020
Is this how a doctor should act?

82
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,260
With your irresponsible attitude, it's hard for me to trust your medical ethics and skills.

83
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,660
I want to see the chief doctor on duty today.

84
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,240
You want to see the chief doctor? Do you think you have the right to see them?

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,120
Besides, don't use seniority to pressure me.

86
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,160
He Xiaoguang, if anything happens to my aunt today, I'll sue you until you can no longer be a doctor.

87
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,820
Do you think I can't handle you?

88
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,440
Security. Security!

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,200
- It's okay, Mom. 
 - Why don't we listen to the doctor and go home first?

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,220
- It's okay, Mom. 
 - Why don't we listen to the doctor and go home first?

91
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,820
Wei'an, let me make a call first. Don't worry.

92
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,460
Mom, Auntie's condition is critical right now.

93
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,000
- This little girl is causing trouble. 
 - What are you doing?

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,980
- Get her out of here. 
 - What are you doing?

95
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,480
- Sir, don't block me. 
 - What? 
 - What's the matter?

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,380
Don't get physical.

97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
It's nothing, someone's causing trouble here.

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,380
You can go about your work, Dr. Gu.

99
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,970
I'm on duty today, so I'll handle this.

100
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,360
Dr. He, I was asking you what's the matter with the patient.

101
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,260
The patient's main complaint is stiffness in her limbs.

102
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,600
Given that she has a history of high blood pressure and Huntington's disease—

103
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
What did you say?

104
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,380
Huntington's disease?

105
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,940
Yes.

106
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,420
The patient shows a positive Babinski sign. Arrange a head CT for her immediately. 
  (TN: foot reflex that leads to extension of the big toe)

107
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,360
Hurry.

108
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
A head CT won't show chorea.

109
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,940
But it can show cerebral hemorrhage.

110
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,880
Dr. Gu.

111
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,820
You're not suspecting that I've misdiagnosed, are you?

112
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,900
The patient is alert and articulate, with symmetrical facial features.

113
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,340
The muscle strength of her limbs is normal.

114
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,560
Even if she shows a positive Babinski sign, Huntington's disease itself may also present pathologically positive signs.

115
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,660
These are the typical fluctuations of chorea symptoms. Why are we wasting more time here?

116
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,080
Instead, the patient's family members are being unreasonable and causing trouble.

117
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,701
If her head CT shows no problems at all, then are they going to sue us for unnecessary treatment?

118
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,040
Dr. He, what are the signs of Huntington's disease?

119
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
Dancing movements.

120
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,740
Hold on, Dr. Gu, Huntington's disease is rare.

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,840
We see very few cases among our patients.

122
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,760
Besides, this isn't my specialty.

123
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,600
By publicly asking me such detailed questions about it,  aren't you making it difficult for me?

124
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,300
Dr. He, you don't even know the specific signs of Huntington's disease.

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,640
How can you be sure that the patient's stiffness is caused by Huntington's disease?

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,000
Right now, shouldn't we rule out more serious illnesses first?

127
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
How long has the patient been like this?

128
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,000
More than three hours.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,460
When she had this symptom in the past, how long did it take to resolve itself?

130
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,740
- About... 
 - Within half an hour.

131
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes.

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,440
Head Nurse, I'm heading to the CT room now to check the patient's results.

133
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,830
Be prepared for surgery at any time.

134
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,680
She needs surgery?

135
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Have faith in Dr. Gu.

136
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,540
It's okay, Wei'an.

137
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,340
I'll stay with you until your aunt is better.

138
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,360
Thank you, Senior.

139
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,700

140
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,820

141
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,700
Aneurysm clip.

142
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,100
What's the patient's relationship to Su Wei'an?

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,720
According to Wei'an's mom, it's her aunt.

144
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,020
Her biological aunt?

145
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,280
I think so.

146
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,960
What's wrong?

147
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,540
Nothing.

148
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,700

149
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Wei'an, it's been so long, why haven't they come out yet?

150
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,240
Should you go ask?

151
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,560
Mom, Gu Yunzheng is the best doctor in the Neurosurgery Department.

152
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,380
Trust him. Don't worry.

153
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,000
Here they come.

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Dr. Gu.

155
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,848
The operation went very well.

156
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,640
But right now, we're still unsure about the extent of damage caused by this hemorrhage to the patient.

157
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,820
She may fully recover from this, but there can also be some functional impairment.

158
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,420
She still needs to be hospitalized for further observation.

159
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,900
Then when will she wake up?

160
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,260
It's hard to say. It depends on the patient's situation.

161
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,420
We'll send her to the ICU first. 
  (T/N: Intensive Care Unit)

162
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,540
When her condition stabilizes, we'll transfer her to the regular ward.

163
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,420
What caused this hemorrhage?

164
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,580
The patient had a ruptured aneurysm.

165
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,740
Aneurysm?

166
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,100
But don't worry.

167
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,540
We've already clipped the responsible aneurysm during the operation.

168
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,460
She's no longer in danger now.

169
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,100
But before my aunt joined the drug trial, she did an MRA. 
  (T/N: Magnetic Resonance Angiography)

170
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,280
Her blood vessels were all normal. How could there be an aneurysm?

171
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,080
That's right.

172
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,720
What drug trial?

173
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,260
HDQ39.

174
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,580
A specialized drug specifically for treating Huntington's disease.

175
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:24,020
It's a joint research project between Jiehui and Professor Wen Yuliang of Zhang He Hospital.

176
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,900
This is considered an adverse event that occurred during a drug trial.

177
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,600
I will communicate with Professor Wen and discuss the patient's future treatment plans with him.

178
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,580
Okay.

179
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,240
Dr. Gu, I guess we'll need your help with a lot of things in the future.

180
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
No problem.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
Mom, it's late. Let the doctor go back and rest.

182
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
- Okay. 
 - Let's go back too.

183
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,600
Then please excuse us.

184
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,780
Auntie, Wei'an, my driver is downstairs. Let me give you a ride.

185
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,820
It's okay, we'll call a taxi.

186
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,180
Yes, Xiao Du, we shouldn't trouble you anymore.

187
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,060
You've been waiting with us for so long already.

188
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,360
It's very late,

189
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,140
and it's a long ride. I'll be worried.

190
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,620
Let's save the courtesy.

191
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,880
If we keep being so polite, it'll be morning soon.

192
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,200
Okay, thank you then.

193
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,760
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

194
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,680
Thanks, Senior.

195
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,380
Let's go.

196
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,840
Xiao Du,

197
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,780
do you know that Dr. Gu from earlier?

198
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,520
Do you know him well?

199
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,780
I know him, but that's all. Is something the matter?

200
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,180
Ah Yuan is hospitalized now.

201
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,060
Wouldn't it be better to have a doctor we know?

202
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,400
Auntie, my father is the director of that hospital.

203
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Other than Dr. Gu, I know all the other heads in the Neurosurgery Department.

204
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,360
If you need any help from them, please feel free to ask.

205
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,780
- That's wonderful. 
 - Mom.

206
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,380
Dr. Gu is very sincere and responsible when treating patients.

207
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,780
Even if you don't ask him, he'll do what a doctor should do.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,160
Do you two know each other?

209
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,540
- They met in Laka— 
 - Dr. Gu is a professor at Huaren.

210
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,800
At our school, he's known for his medical skills and ethics.

211
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
You don't have to worry.

212
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
Good. That's good, then.

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,620
 The patient's main complaint is stiffness in her limbs.

214
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,320
 Given that she has a history of high blood pressure and Huntington's disease...

215
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,440
 What's the patient's relationship to Su Wei'an?

216
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,340
 According to Wei'an's mom, it's her aunt.

217
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,505
 Her biological aunt?

218
00:15:34,505 --> 00:15:37,660
 I think so. What's wrong?

219
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,500
 Huntington's disease?

220
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,720
Good morning, Dr. Gu.

221
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,880
Wait, Li Wantong, what are you trying to do?

222
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,180
You tell me.

223
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,260
It is said that giving a man a tie can win his heart.

224
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,560
This brand is suitable for the outstanding you.

225
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,320
Miss Su! Long time no see.

226
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,460
I picked out a tie for Dr. Gu. Does it look good?

227
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,980
Yes.

228
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,200
Do you want to come in?

229
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,760
No thanks.

230
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,485
Gu Yunzheng, doing such a manly thing in front of me

231
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:18,400
will only make me even more obsessed with you.

232
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,560
Li Wantong and I aren't what you think.

233
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,420
You don't need to explain to me. I don't mind.

234
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,180
You're lying.

235
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,020
Why are you afraid to look me in the eye right now?

236
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,020
Su Wei'an, do you know that your eyes and expressions can give you away?

237
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,540
Can I ask you for a favor?

238
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,340
Can you please pretend not to know me in front of my mom?

239
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,905
I don't want her to know everything about my time in Lakaya.

240
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:08,485
Is it everything about Lakaya, or everything between us?

241
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,780
Are you trying to hide it from your mom, or are you afraid Du Yuncheng will misunderstand?

242
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,520
Are you afraid they'll find out that you took a beating for me?

243
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,640
Are you afraid they'll find out we saw a night rainbow together?

244
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,820
Or are you afraid they'll find out we've watched the stars together?

245
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,860
We've been through so much together in Lakaya.

246
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,260
Which one are you most afraid of them finding out about?

247
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
All of them.

248
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,860
Dr. Gu, if you keep dwelling on the past, it becomes meaningless.

249
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,340
What are you doing?

250
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,120
This is a hospital.

251
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,400
Luckily it's a hospital.

252
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,820
If it wasn't, would you run away again?

253
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,120
Su Wei'an, from now on, don't even think about running away again.

254
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,340
Instead of thinking about how to leave me,

255
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,800
you might as well think about how to honestly explain why you left without saying goodbye.

256
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,140
There's nothing for me to explain.

257
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,820
You're lying to me.

258
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,000
It was for Du Yuncheng, all right?

259
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,400
Auntie, don't be nervous. It's okay.

260
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

261
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,260
Senior, what are you doing here?

262
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,140
Have you returned with the food?

263
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,380
It's all thanks to Xiao Du.

264
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,720
He's here helping me with Auntie's matters.

265
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,040
There's so much I don't understand.

266
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,540
Luckily, he's here. Hurry and thank him for me.

267
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,640
Thank you, Senior.

268
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
Let's not be so formal.

269
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,920
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

270
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,275
- Come here, sit down. 
 - Come. Sit.

271
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,240
What's wrong? Are you not wearing enough?

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,940
I'm fine.

273
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,380
You still remember?

274
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,120
Do you always have candy with you?

275
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,360
Wei'an has hypoglycemia.

276
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,180
After I met her, I got used to carrying a piece of White Rabbit candy with me. 
  (T/N: A Chinese milk candy)

277
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,960
He's so thoughtful, isn't he?

278
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,520
Why are you here?

279
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,160
Why can't I be here? Shouldn't I be the one asking you this?

280
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,320
You must be busy with your company. What are you doing here?

281
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,000
Ms. Su Yuan is a drug trial subject for HDQ39.

282
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,200
We need to pay close attention. Is there a problem?

283
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,560
No problem.

284
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm more than glad that you can also stop by to see me.

285
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:12,500
Auntie, hello. Things were too hurried yesterday.

286
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,440
I didn't even get a chance to greet you.

287
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
I wasn't experienced enough earlier.

288
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,700
I didn't know there was a mistake with Dr. He's diagnosis.

289
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,440
I didn't expect the situation to be so serious.

290
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm really sorry.

291
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,780
Mom, this is Wen Ran, my classmate from university.

292
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,340
Yes, Auntie. I was Wei'an's best friend in university.

293
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,940
And now, I'm also Yuncheng's girlfriend.

294
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,240
You two are good friends?

295
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,780
You're so pretty. And elegant, too.

296
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,980
- Thank you, Auntie. 
 - It's nice to meet you.

297
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:51,060
Wei'an, you said before that your distant relative was diagnosed with Huntington's disease.

298
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,240
I didn't expect it to be your biological aunt.

299
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,060
This isn't a distant relative anymore, it's a close relative.

300
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
I remember that chorea is genetically dominant in the family.

301
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,120
I remember that chorea is genetically dominant in the family.

302
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,600
The probability of it is 50%.

303
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,840
- Wei'an, are you— 
 - Of course not.

304
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,880
For this kind of thing, it's better to do a genetic test to be sure.

305
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Did you do one yet, Wei'an?

306
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,060
Yes.

307
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,440
I'm negative. I don't have the disease-causing gene.

308
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,000
Where did you do the test?

309
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,800
Nowadays, many institutions out there are scams.

310
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,420
Why don't you give me the report? I'll take a look at it for you.

311
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,340
There's no need. Thank you for your kindness.

312
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,680
Did you do the test at our Huaren Hospital?

313
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,240
We all have electronic records now. I can help you pull it up and take a look.

314
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,820
There's no need.

315
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,880
Doing the test is good enough. You don't need to push her.

316
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
How is this pushing her?

317
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,900
Wei'an is my best friend from university.

318
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,100
I'm just worried about her.

319
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,940
Auntie, our Huaren Hospital is the best institution for genetic testing.

320
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,960
What if the results from a small hospital outside aren't accurate?

321
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,860
I still have to see the report to feel at ease.

322
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,120
Don't you think so too, Auntie?

323
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,720
Yes.

324
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,600
Wei'an, why don't we do another test when we have time?

325
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,880
Xiao Ran, did you have breakfast yet?

326
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,660
No.

327
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,400
Come with me to get a cup of coffee.

328
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,060
Okay.

329
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,540
I'll be going then.

330
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,180
This girlfriend of his—

331
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,840
I already told you before. Don't randomly match people up.

332
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,580
And she's good friends with you.

333
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,000
Isn't she too naive?

334
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,140
She was so easily tricked by that incompetent Dr. He.

335
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,680
Actually, you're the naive one.

336
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,960
Fang Mingfan, actually, your knowledge base is already sufficient.

337
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,260
Watching so many videos and not doing anything hands-on is pointless.

338
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,700
Boss, sharpening the knife won't hinder chopping wood. 
  (T/N: Making preparations won't hurt.)

339
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,320
I've already told Jiang Jiang.

340
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,820
I promised her that I'd go see Dr. Li for psychological counseling.

341
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,760
Within this month,

342
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,165
I'll get rid of my phobia.

343
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,965
One month?

344
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,880
Do you really mean it?

345
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
One month, no more, no less. Just trust me, Boss.

346
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,705
Okay.

347
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,605
I'll trust you one more time.

348
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,180
Boss, what are you doing in the office right now?

349
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,480
I have an afternoon shift.

350
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,360
Where else should I be?

351
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,700
Su Wei'an's whole family is at the hospital.

352
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,400
It's the perfect opportunity for you to shine.

353
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,800
I heard that someone from Jiehui has been coming here every day recently.

354
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
And he's been coming super early in the morning.

355
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,600
Boss, you're falling behind.

356
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,080
Who's this someone?

357
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,200
It's the guy who used to rarely come to our hospital to see Dr. Wen.

358
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,380
He's been quite proactive lately.

359
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,900
You're quite proactive too. No wonder you came so early.

360
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,360
What?

361
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,465
In your eyes, am I someone who doesn't properly do their job?

362
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,530
No. Our Boss

363
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,610
is the most dedicated person.

364
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,340
 I just don't believe you can keep sitting still here.

365
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,000
 Five. Four. Three. Two.

366
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,931
Now you're coming to your senses.

367
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,940
Mom, go home and rest for a bit.

368
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,820
But what if something happens to Ah Yuan overnight?

369
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,260
I'm here. I'll keep an eye on her.

370
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,740
Okay. I'll go home and bring the stuff she'll need in the hospital then.

371
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,240
- Xiao Du, thank you so much. 
 - Not at all, Auntie.

372
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,100
Be careful.

373
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Okay, I'm leaving.

374
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,820
Wei'an, there's a five-star hotel nearby that signed a cooperation agreement with our company.

375
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,980
Wei'an, there's a five-star hotel nearby that signed a cooperation agreement with our company.

376
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,860
How about I ask Assistant Lin to arrange a room for you there?

377
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,940
There's no need. I'll just stay here.

378
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,780
What if something happens?

379
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,260
What could happen?

380
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,140
I'll tell Assistant Lin to come. He'll keep you updated. It's nearby.

381
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,460
I have an apartment very close to the hospital.

382
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,280
I'll sleep in the hospital for the next few days. You can go stay at my place.

383
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,940
No need. I can just rest here.

384
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,320
No need. I can just rest here.

385
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,220
Rest here? In the corridor?

386
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,000
Rest here? In the corridor?

387
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,340
How would that work?

388
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,580
The hospital has a clear rule that no one can sleep in the corridor.

389
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,420
Sleeping here not only affects your own rest, but also disrupts other patients and their families.

390
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,540
Sleeping here not only affects your own rest, but also disrupts other patients and their families.

391
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,860
You should stay in the hotel. It'll be more comfortable at night.

392
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,020
You should stay in the hotel. It'll be more comfortable at night.

393
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,160
My neighborhood is very quiet. There are no hooligans around.

394
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,180
It's safer for girls to live there.

395
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,980
There's really no need.

396
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,660
Just leave me alone for a while.

397
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,140
How about this, Wei'an?

398
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,440
When I'm on duty, you can stay in the lounge for attending doctors.

399
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
When I'm on duty, you can stay in the lounge for attending doctors.

400
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I'll sleep in the office.

401
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,960
There are showers and beds there.

402
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,920
You can also use my card to get breakfast in the morning.

403
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,480
This will also make it more convenient for you to look after Auntie.

404
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,740
Wei'an, if you fall sick due to fatigue,

405
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,340
Wei'an, if you fall sick due to fatigue,

406
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,580
who will take care of your mom and aunt?

407
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,120
Thank you then.

408
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,860
I'll go buy some things.

409
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,000
Senior, you should go back and rest early too.

410
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,280
President Du.

411
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,620
Does your girlfriend know that you're being so concerned about Wei'an here?

412
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,720
I hope you can take care of yourself, as well as your girlfriend.

413
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,060
What do you mean?

414
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,820
I suggest you go and ask the owner of One Way Bar.

415
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,900
Ask him to show you the surveillance footage.

416
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:58,480
You'll find out what really happened on the day Wei'an was harassed.

417
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,380
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence to run into you in the attending doctors' lounge.

418
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,980
Dr. Gu, what a coincidence to run into you in the attending doctors' lounge.

419
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,660
It's okay.

420
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Dr. He, the current surgical indications for the patient in bed No. 26 are clearly not suitable for minimally invasive surgery.

421
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
Dr. He, the current surgical indications for the patient in bed No. 26 are clearly not suitable for minimally invasive surgery.

422
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,300
Why don't you consider a craniotomy?

423
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,540
That was because the patient's family insisted.

424
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,900
Who's the patient's attending doctor?

425
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,340
Dr. He, I think you should be very clear

426
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,360
about whether it's the patient listening to the doctor or the doctor listening to the patient.

427
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,740
about whether it's the patient listening to the doctor or the doctor listening to the patient.

428
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,840
Mind your own business.

429
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,060
Here, have some water.

430
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,420
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

431
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,280
Thank you for getting rid of He Xiaoguang for me.

432
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:33,000
Then why don't you thank me for getting rid of Du Yuncheng?

433
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,340
Thanks for that too.

434
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,245
In hospital public areas, single men and women should not get too close.

435
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:40,900
In hospital public areas, single men and women should not get too close.

436
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,380
It can easily attract gossip.

437
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,140
If Du Yuncheng bothers you again in the future, just tell him directly.

438
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,420
Don't cause unnecessary trouble for yourself.

439
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,520
You're right, Dr. Gu.

440
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,780
Is this how you treat your benefactor?

441
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,020
Isn't that what you said just now, Dr. Gu?

442
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,170
Single men and women being together in public areas like this can easily attract gossip.

443
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,040
So in your heart, I'm the same as Du Yuncheng.

444
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,100
Is there any difference?

445
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:15,705
What's the difference?

446
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,600
Do you need me to prove what's different?

447
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,020
Gu Yunzheng, this is the hospital.

448
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,520
Hurry up and get out. I'm busy.

449
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,100
Su Wei'an,

450
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:51,397
what is this?

451
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,560
It's just an ordinary stone.

452
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,420
If it's just that, is it necessary to put a metal ring on it?

453
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,140
Indeed, it's not necessary.

454
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,020
Throw it away then.

455
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,280
How could I bear to throw it away?

456
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,640
Because this stone...

457
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,620
I know you can't forget the person who gave you this stone.

458
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,240
You're overthinking things, Dr. Gu.

459
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,060
This is just a souvenir from my trip to Lakaya.

460
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,420
For you, Lakaya is a place worth remembering.

461
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,680
Get out! I want to sleep.

462
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,060
Brother Xiao Kai, actually, there's something I didn't tell you.

463
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,800
I already have a boyfriend.

464
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,880
Brother Xiao Kai, actually, I already have a boyfriend.

465
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,040
My boyfriend is a doctor who saves people's lives.

466
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,140
To me, when he's working, he shines like an angel.

467
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,920
I think...

468
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,040
It's okay, I can do this.

469
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,440
Xiao Ying.

470
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,520
Brother Xiao Kai, I have something to tell you.

471
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,200
Xiao Ying. I'm sorry.

472
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,680
Thank you for hanging out with me these days.

473
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,570
But to be honest, I've always seen you as the little sister I grew up with.

474
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:15,030
If this caused any misunderstanding, I must apologize.

475
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,720
You're not pursuing me?

476
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,140
You know, my parents kept pushing me to get married.

477
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,840
I really had no other choice.

478
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,660
But everything is fine now. They've gone back to America.

479
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,250
So every time you asked me out was just to put on a show for your parents?

480
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:38,080
Honestly, you're not my type.

481
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,480
Well, if there's nothing else, I have to go work out with a friend.

482
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,160
I'll head out first.

483
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,940
I guess...

484
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:02,782
I've been fooled.

485
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,480
Dr. Fang.

486
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:31,749
You're studying?

487
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,860
You're even reading reference books.

488
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:41,740
You've been in clinical practice for so many years. What happened? Have you forgotten all the basics?

489
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,280
You're starting to practice again like when you were in university?

490
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:53,280
Speaking of which, Gu Yunzheng is truly quite brave to ask you to be his first assistant.

491
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,940
I think one day, you might ruin his zero-fatality on the operating table record.

492
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm joking.

493
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,680
This is none of your business.

494
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
I'll overcome these problems myself.

495
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,520
Xiao Fang. You see, efforts will always yield results, but they might not always lead to success.

496
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,120
So take my advice.

497
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,760
If you really can't do it, don't force yourself.

498
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,280
Just give up.

499
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,320
You can't give up.

500
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,520
Jiang Jiang?

501
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,980
I think Dr. Fang will achieve great things in the future.

502
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,520
Because he knows where his problems are and he's thinking of solutions every day.

503
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,880
Unlike some doctors who can only envy others' abilities and give up at the slightest difficulty.

504
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,260
Read more biographies of famous people.

505
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,420
How many people peak early in their careers only to end up with nothing?

506
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,140
And how many people find success in their later years?

507
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,920
Dr. Fang is definitely the latter.

508
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,000
I hope you, Doctor, are not the former.

509
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,720
Is she your friend? What a sharp tongue.

510
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,640
Just ignore him.

511
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,080
Thank you, Jiang Jiang.

512
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,460
If anyone dares to stop you from trying, I'll teach them a proper lesson.

513
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,320
Okay.

514
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,200
Go ahead.

515
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,540
Come in.

516
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,120
Why are you here again?

517
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,640
You tell me.

518
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,160
What's the matter?

519
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,220
It's too stuffy in here. Let's eat outside.

520
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,320
Eat outside?

521
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,920
Are you sure?

522
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,720
Yes.

523
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,820
Here.

524
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,060
Eat some more.

525
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,800
 If I knew people would stare at me like a national treasure when I ate outside, I would've just eaten inside.

526
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,080
Just focus on eating.

527
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,140
Don't worry about them.

528
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,960
If you ignore them, they'll disperse on their own.

529
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,660
Is there something on my face?

530
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,400
The way you eat hasn't changed at all.

531
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,640
Once you develop a habit, it's tough to change it.

532
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,260
No matter how hard you try to pretend, it won't work.

533
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,160
Why do I get criticized even when I'm eating?

534
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,040
I'm full.

535
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,020
Okay, I won't say any more.

536
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,740
You've been working hard caring for the patient.

537
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,540
Eat some more.

538
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,120
Su Wei'an,

539
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,160
- why on earth would you— 
 - If you keep asking questions, I'm going to be full again.

540
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,740
Okay, I'll stop.

541
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,040
I won't force you.

542
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,560
But if you want to tell me one day, I'm always ready.

543
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,440
 How did she know where I was?

544
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,860

545
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,220

546
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,940
 Wen Ran, you're actually tracking me.

547
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,740
Yuncheng, you rarely ask me out.

548
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,140
We haven't had a date like this in a long time.

549
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,160
Let's break up.

550
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,900
Yuncheng, you're joking, right?

551
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:19,260
For so many years, I've been trying to convince myself that you're my best choice.

552
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:24,560
Although it's not a perfect match, at least we were happy together.

553
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,440
But now I've realized that we're not people of the same world.

554
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,960
Don't we have a lot in common?

555
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,780
Yuncheng, if there's anything I didn't do well enough, just tell me.

556
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,060
I can always improve.

557
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:45,360
From the very beginning, we weren't a good fit.

558
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,280
I'm sorry.

559
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,880
Yuncheng.

560
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,200
It's because of Su Wei'an, isn't it?

561
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,760
It has nothing to do with her.

562
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,300
Ever since we met Su Wei'an again, you've changed.

563
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,400
Since you insist on mentioning her, fine.

564
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,140
Let me ask you.

565
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,660
That night at One Way Bar, why did that troublemaker find her?

566
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,560
How am I supposed to know?

567
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
You can deny it.

568
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,000
But the bar's surveillance camera recorded everything.

569
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,680
Before Su Wei'an came back, we were fine with each other.

570
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,400
And as soon as she came back, you want to break up with me.

571
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,600
If it's not because of her, then what is it?

572
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,080
You peeked at my phone, didn't you?

573
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

574
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,930
When did you install such a thing on my phone?

575
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:10,080

576
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,080
