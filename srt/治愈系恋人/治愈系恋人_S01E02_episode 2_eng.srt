 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,060
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,340
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:49,100
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,440
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,020
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,680

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,180

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,900
What could be better for you than this French interpreter job?

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,580
No way.

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,480
I haven't tried it yet. Why do you say I can't do it?

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,820
Yes, Dr. Gu. Wei'an can do it.

20
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,580
She's very good at French. And she knows medicine.

21
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,080
She even saved someone today, didn't you know? You even helped us.

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,707
So you're the surgical genius.

23
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:02,627
That hole was very precise.

24
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:11,220
Working at a hospital is hard and poorly paid.

25
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,120
You can't keep it up. It's not suitable.

26
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
Can I apply for the job?

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,740
I know French, too.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,780
Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Spinal cord injury classification.

29
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,640
Cranial nerve palsy. Translate, please.

30
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,660
 I don't even know what they mean in Chinese. Not to mention French.

31
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,960
I...

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,060
I...

33
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,082
But I have a heart filled with devotion.

34
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:50,842
I want to do my little part.

35
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,440
Well, your little part seems insignificant enough to ignore.

36
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,540
Forget it.

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,820
We just want to pay you back soon as possible, Dr. Gu.

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,800
- No need to repay it. 
 - No way!

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,660
Debts should be repaid.

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,260
Boss.

41
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,100
It's the first time I've seen someone with debts act so boldly.

42
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,900
Dr. Gu.

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,580
The patient has grade 5 muscle strength in the left upper limb and both lower limbs.

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,300
The neck is soft with no stiff-neck. Babinski sign is negative.

45
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,080
The patient is recovering well.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,900
Pardon.

47
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,760
- Grade 5 muscle strength... 
- Grade 5 muscle strength

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,580
in the left upper limb and both lower limbs. The neck is soft with no stiff-neck.

49
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,380
The Babinski sign is negative. The patient's condition is normal.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,540
He's recovering well.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,540
Is this our new interpreter?

52
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,670
See, I told you Wei'an can do it.

53
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,580
That's right, Boss. She's impressive.

54
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,120
We've found a treasure.

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,200
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

56
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,920
You have a one-month probation period. I hope you won't give up halfway again.

57
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,803
Hold on.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,940
Is there anything else to discuss?

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,670
Let's clarify the conditions first. Weekly pay with full board.

60
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,900
Also, Jiang Muying must join me in starting the job. And we're moving in tonight.

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,560
We only need one interpreter.

62
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,540
Boss, the more, the merrier.

63
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,340
- But professional French vocabulary... 
 - She can learn.

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,080
- I can learn. 
 - I can teach.

65
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,320
Arrange dormitories for both of them.

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
Wei'an, you were amazing just now.

67
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,760
You translated such a long list of medical terms.

68
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,700
It shows that even though you dropped out of school for three years, you haven't forgotten your expertise.

69
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,060
This knowledge has been ingrained in your bones and your instincts.

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,540
Not really...

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,540
Wait. It's only been a while. Where did you get the clothes?

72
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,220
Clothes? You dare mention it?

73
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,840
All my beautiful clothes in the suitcase are now all gone.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,860
If I hadn't found a night market nearby, I wouldn't have any clothes to change tomorrow.

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,420
I've bought some for you too.

76
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,120
Take a look. Do you want to change?

77
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,320
Let's put them away.

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,220
All right.

79
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Is this left by the previous doctor?

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,680
If you hadn't dropped out of school, you'd probably be a resident by now.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm sure you'd be wearing this white coat. How cool it would be!

82
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,920
I'll put this in the cabinet. You can try it later.

83
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,300

84
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,340
These guys are impressive.

85
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,440
They've been here for hours without moving, not even going to the restroom.

86
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,200
Maybe we should come back another day.

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,680
No. My hard-earned money is inside.

88
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,160
No way. We have to do something.

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,860
Make money!

90
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,100
Who is he?

91
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,160
- My employee. 
 - I miss you so much, Mommy An!

92
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Okay. Don't speak anymore. I'm busy right now.

93
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,920
Sakun!

94
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,660
It's dangerous. Sakun!

95
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,120
Wait, Su Wei'an. You hired a child?

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,290
No. He just runs errands for me.

97
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,420
Like delivering milk to customers.

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,100
Sakun!

99
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,660
He just called you mommy.

100
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,860
He calls anyone who's nice to him mommy and daddy.

101
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,100
He has several siblings in his family.

102
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,640
And Sakun has been sick since birth. His mother doesn't care about him.

103
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,210
And his dad has passed away.

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,660
What illness?

105
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,380
AIDS.

106
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,800
Sakun!

107
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,600
- How do you know about this? 
 - I always knew it meant a lot to you.

108
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,940
Let's go!

109
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,100
Sakun.

110
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Have you been good lately? Do you remember what I told you?

111
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't get hurt or bleed.

112
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,420
Have you been taking your medicine on time?

113
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,180
No, Mom can't afford it.

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,700
- Do you feel any discomfort anywhere? 
 - Headache.

115
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,540
Why don't you go to the hospital?

116
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,620
Mom says it's too expensive. We can't afford it.

117
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
It's okay, Sakun.

118
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,300
- We'll make money. 
 - Great! Make money!

119
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,240
Sakun! Where are you?

120
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,300
Mom.

121
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,620
Be careful!

122
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,580
Where did you go?

123
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,120
Where have you been?

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Who told you to run around? Go home!

125
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,000
I've got a headache.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,880
If you go to sleep, you won't feel the headache anymore.

127
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,840
Have you seen An?

128
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,040
No, I haven't.

129
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,020
Tell me if you see her.

130
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,060
It’s a disaster! I shouldn’t have rented her the house. Does she not understand it’s a large sum of money?

131
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,780
What a waste! Such a large sum of money!

132
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,320
I must find her!

133
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,560
- What are you doing? You'll have to pay for it if you go out now. 
 - You understand? We must find her!

134
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,540
I'm going to compensate her. Sakun's treatment.

135
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,960
Are you crazy?

136
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,100
You work so hard to earn money just to treat a child who's not even related to you?

137
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,220
Are you nuts?

138
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,540
His own mother doesn't even care about him. Why do you take care of him?

139
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,860
Because those with the same illness empathize with each other. 
  (fig. misery loves company)

140
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,000
What illness!

141
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,000
Wake up, Su Wei'an!

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
AIDS is incurable. You know that.

143
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,200
What about him? Should he just wait to die?

144
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,460
He's still so young.

145
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,700
As long as he takes his medicine and controls his condition well, he'll be cured one day.

146
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,960
Wait! What's wrong with you?

147
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,760
I mean, even if you pay him money, will his mother take him to a doctor?

148
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah, you're right.

149
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,000
It's not just money. He needs medicine more than anything.

150
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320

151
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600
Dr. Gu.

152
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,870
- Are you okay, Wei'an? 
 - I'm fine.

153
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,540

154
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,700
You've dropped out of school. Why do you still keep your campus card from Huaren Medical University?

155
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,500
Why don't you throw it away along with your dream?

156
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,220
Why should I throw it away?

157
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,420
There's still money in it. I can use it when I go back to school.

158
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,500
Is it all right if I fold it up and put it in the box?

159
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,100
Okay.

160
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,980

161
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,900
Wei'an.

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,580
Why did you buy such a large amount of accident insurance?

163
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,680
And the beneficiary is your mom?

164
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,280
It's inauspicious to buy an accident insurance.

165
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,800
Why do you curse yourself?

166
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,120
Fortunes can change in an instant. I'm alone in a foreign country.

167
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,600
Who knows what might happen?

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,900
And you, if you insist on following me,

169
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,080
I suggest you get one too.

170
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,540
- Don't curse me! 
 - I'm not cursing you.

171
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,700

172
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,680
What are you looking at?

173
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,440
Let me show you.

174
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,120
She's gone square dancing again.

175
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,300
Sister Lan is so cute.

176
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
Jiang Jiang.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,780
You've been in Lakaya for long enough. Why don't you go home early?

178
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,680
I'm really busy here.

179
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,440
Tell Sister Lan when you get back that I'm doing well in Paris.

180
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,620
Are you kidding me? It's so different from Paris.

181
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,200
It's not so bad.

182
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Working in the city center and living in a double room.

183
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
The healthcare and catering are well-matched.

184
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
What's wrong with it?

185
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,580
All right.

186
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,200
Since it's so good here, I won't leave then.

187
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,360
I, Jiang Muying, have a job now. I'm also an interpreter.

188
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,100
Okay.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,340
Go to bed. It's late.

190
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
What about you?

191
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,080
I'll go to sleep soon.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,740
Okay.

193
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,220
Wei'an.

194
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,900
I feel like you've changed a lot in the three years since we last saw each other.

195
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,520

196
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,700

197
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,750

198
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,250

199
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,540
Oh, honey. I'm still at the office.

200
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,840
I don't have any plans for tomorrow. How about you?

201
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
It looks like it's going to rain heavily outside.

202
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,100
Okay.

203
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,480
The signal here is not good when it rains.

204
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm going outside so I can talk to you.

205
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,640
Hello. Why don't you come pick me up?

206
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,060
I don't think I'm going to make it to your place today.

207
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,080
Okay.

208
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,320
Hey, Security. There was someone...

209
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,160
 If the security guards catch her, she would be retaken to the police station.

210
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,840
It's all right.

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,980
But why don't you come pick me up? I want go to your place.

212
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,360
Yes, I miss you too.

213
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,090
You can come to the hospital to pick me up.

214
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,560

215
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,460
What are you doing?

216
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,830
Okay, I love you.

217
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,330

218
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,540
Bye.

219
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,860
Su Wei'an.

220
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,880
What are you doing here?

221
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,900
Don't you know that trespassing in the pharmacy can be a crime?

222
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,780
No, I didn't trespass. I... I'm here to see...

223
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,520

224
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,540
Etravirine,

225
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,380
the medicine to treat HIV.

226
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,500
You trying to steal the medicine?

227
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,860
Of course not. Don't say it like that.

228
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,540
I'm here to buy the medicine.

229
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,660
Stop denying!

230
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,240
Now, I have reason to suspect that you're selling drugs illegally.

231
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,340
No wonder you suddenly came to the hospital to apply for an interpreter job.

232
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,000
So this was your plan.

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,080
No, it isn't.

234
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,240
Dr. Gu. Dr. Gu, please listen to me.

235
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,660
Dr. Gu.

236
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,700
- Security! Is anyone there? 
 - Be quiet.

237
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,200
- Hello? 
 - W-W-We'll be caught.

238
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,540
You've got a lot of guts. You're still afraid of being found?

239
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,760
When I saw you acting suspiciously outside just now, I should have called security to take you away.

240
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,580
And we wouldn't be locked up here now.

241
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,780
Let me explain.

242
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,540
What are you doing?

243
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,640
Calling security.

244
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,660
No, please don't.

245
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,700
I forgot to tell you. The base station is unstable here when it rains. There's no signal.

246
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,940
It seems like fate.

247
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I guess you won't take me to the police station again, will you?

248
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:28,060
Don't you know that the main switch controls the lights in the pharmacy?

249
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
What are you planning to do now?

250
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,780
Find something to break the window.

251
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,700
No! We'll be discovered if you do that.

252
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,120
What do you mean by "we"? What's it got to do with me?

253
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,700
You dared to come here to steal medicine. You should have thought about the consequences.

254
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,200
No, I didn't.

255
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,060
Fine. Go ahead. You recruited me anyway.

256
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,300
If we get caught, I'll say that you ordered me to steal

257
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,860
and sell the medication. We'll split the profit 70/30. Seven for you, three for me.

258
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,680
Wait.

259
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,540
Don't you have any morals?

260
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,160
What's that? Is it worth anything?

261
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,020
Snake!

262
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,860
Get your hands off me!

263
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,450
It's just a gecko.

264
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,800
 This was a birthday gift from my mother.

265
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,280
 What's the big deal? I just wanted to take a look.

266
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm really sorry.

267
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,900
Please don't be angry. I was just trying to scare you.

268
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,300
I won't get you into trouble.

269
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,380
Move aside.

270
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,280
That medicine isn't for me. It's for someone to extend their life.

271
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,680
Let go of it.

272
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,540
Let me help you put it back together.

273
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,120
Is this bracelet important to you?

274
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,395
 You broke my bracelet.

275
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:03,500
 It can't be fixed anymore.

276
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,157
 You're annoying, and so is your mom.

277
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,000
 Leave my house.

278
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,260
 It's my house. You're annoying. Go away!

279
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,623
 Go!

280
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:17,900
 Yunzheng. Let go.

281
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,720
 What are you doing?

282
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,000
 Honey.

283
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
 It's all Yuncheng's fault. Don't blame Yunzheng.

284
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,580
 Yuncheng, apologize to your brother.

285
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,487
 You child.

286
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,000
Try to put it together on this paper.

287
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,640
It will be clearer this way.

288
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,860
You can't do it like that. The letters are in the wrong order.

289
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,760
I've tried many combinations but can't get a complete meaning out of it.

290
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,540
Let me help you.

291
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,400
Okay?

292
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,100
Okay, it's done. Dark rainbow.

293
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,440
That's what it means in French.

294
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,560
Dark rainbow.

295
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,080
Yeah.

296
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,740
Dark rainbow. It's a rainbow in the night sky.

297
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,440
It's a super miracle.

298
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,000
The person who gave you this bracelet

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,300
probably wanted to bring you good luck.

300
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
Is it from your first love?

301
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,520
Or from your girlfriend?

302
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,060
No.

303
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,480
I've figured it out for you. You should be feeling better now, right?

304
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,800
You won't report me, will you?

305
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,940
It's a different story.

306
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,500
I know a lot of rumors the dark rainbow.

307
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,360
Would you like to hear them?

308
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,940
Like what?

309
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,990
Like...

310
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,660
Like the fact that the dark rainbow only appears under specific conditions.

311
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,680
If you're lucky enough to see it, it means

312
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,460
that somewhere in this world, a miracle

313
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,560
is happening.

314
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,060
It's so romantic, right?

315
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,160
And I also know where you can see it.

316
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,800
- Do you? 
 - Yes.

317
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,740
It's far away.

318
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,820
But it doesn't matter. As long as you take my vehicle.

319
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,500
For the sake of our friendship tonight.

320
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,720
Give you a 20% discount. How about that?

321
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,920
No, thanks.

322
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
Why didn't you push me away?

323
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,600
You're too heavy. I couldn't move you.

324
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,460
You could have woken me up.

325
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,440
You've been pressing on me all night.

326
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,960
I fell asleep at dawn. I just woke up.

327
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,720
How could I have been pressing on you all night? I'm not a mountain.

328
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,420
Are you sure you just woke up?

329
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,720
 How can you be so tidy when you've just woken up?

330
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,900
 You're so fresh and clean. Suspicious.

331
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,320
 He's… good-looking.

332
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,580
Who is it for?

333
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,400
You said that medicine is for extending someone's life.

334
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,440
For a friend who can't come to the hospital.

335
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,360
Why can't he come to the hospital?

336
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,800
Not everyone is like you in this world,

337
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,260
with a stable income and good health.

338
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,000
Many people can't afford to come to the hospital.

339
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,100
What's worse,

340
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,143
even if they have money,

341
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,360
some diseases can't be cured.

342
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,460
Dr. Gu.

343
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:44,414
We were here last night, and...

344
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,160
I understand.

345
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,840
She said she understood.

346
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,720
Understood?

347
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,240
But I didn't finish explaining.

348
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,220
Don't worry, I didn't see anything.

349
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,540
Come with me.

350
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,640
Last night...

351
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,000
Thank you for helping me figure out the meaning behind those letters.

352
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,020
I should be thanking you for not reporting me.

353
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,900
You can't take these medicine away.

354
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,240
Please. I'll give you more money, okay?

355
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,840
Double the amount?

356
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,540
No need.

357
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,460
For a cheapskate like you to be so willing to spend money,

358
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,060
this person must be very important to you.

359
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,380
How about this? Can you give me a box first?

360
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,060
No, I can't.

361
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,080
Let me keep these medicine for now.

362
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Bring the patient to the hospital within 24 hours.

363
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,660
No matter how difficult it is, we can work it out together.

364
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,900
But you can't

365
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,100
take these prescription drugs so easily.

366
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,920
Shut up, you're making a lot of noise.

367
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,740
Your crying is giving me a headache. Bear it.

368
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,340
Sakun, come on, get up.

369
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,515
- How are you feeling? 
 - I'm getting a headache.

370
00:30:10,515 --> 00:30:12,240
Headache?

371
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,040
How dare you come back?

372
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,880
My house was destroyed because of you.

373
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,100
You have to pay me double.

374
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,020
I'll pay. But you have to take him to the hospital.

375
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,840
He can't stop taking his medicine, don't you know that?

376
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,080
Are you kidding me? We're poor, don't you know that?

377
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,420
We don't even have enough money to eat. It's even more impossible to get medicine.

378
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,380
Sakun.

379
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,840
You wretched child, why don't you just die?

380
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,260
You're a waste of food.

381
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,600
Sakun.

382
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,040
-  Do you feel any discomfort anywhere? 
 - Headache.

383
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,280
Oh no.

384
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,260
Let's go.

385
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,500
Put him down.

386
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,580
He needs to go to the hospital immediately. Otherwise, his life will be in danger.

387
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,080
You caused my house to be destroyed.

388
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,600
Even triple the rent won't be enough to compensate me.

389
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,980
Money! You only care about money.

390
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,840
Hello?

391
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,340
You said if I tell you where Su Wei'an is, you'll give me money?

392
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,970
She went to the hospital.

393
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,350

394
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,920
Dr. Gu, help him!

395
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,860
What happened?

396
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,240
The patient has a headache, with projectile vomiting and unsteady gait.

397
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,780
Fang Mingfan. Take him for a CT scan of his head immediately.

398
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,180
- Hurry up! 
 - Okay.

399
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,040
Be careful.

400
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,280
You're the surgeon with a zero mortality rate. Will he be okay?

401
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,440
Don't worry. Where are his parents?

402
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,880
- He might need immediate surgery. 
 - I'll sign it.

403
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,880
- You? 
 - Surgery fees and hospitalization fees. I'll take care of all the expenses.

404
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,840
You'll take care of it?

405
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,040
Please, I'm begging you. You must save him.

406
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,880
Boss. There's a shadow at the bottom of the third ventricle. It's hydrocephalus caused by obstruction.

407
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,280
I'm going to find the child's family to sign the consent form.

408
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,320
I'll sign it.

409
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,340
We can't get in touch with the patient's family at the moment. Let her sign it.

410
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,800

411
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,240
- Surgery now. 
 - Yes.

412
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,700
By the way, the patient is HIV positive. Take proper precautions.

413
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:30,189
The medicine you took last night was for him.

414
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,940
Fang Mingfan, notify the operating room for level 1 protection.

415
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,560
Replace all the nurses with wounds.

416
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,260
Yes.

417
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,740
 What kind of person is she?

418
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,640
Interpreter Su.

419
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,500
You'll be the interpreter for this surgery. Is there a problem?

420
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,700
No problem.

421
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,700
Your posture is very standard. You really look like a doctor.

422
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,740
 You just look like a doctor, Su Wei'an. Did you forget? You can't be a doctor for the rest of your life.

423
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,580
Start the surgery.

424
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,550
- Increase the electrocoagulation. 
 - Increase the electrocoagulation.

425
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,640
- Increase the suction. 
 - Increase the suction.

426
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,340
I... I think I pressed on something.

427
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,100
Don't move. It's a cysticercus.

428
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,620
Dr. Fang, keep your hand steady.

429
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,100
The cysticercus wall is adhering to the basilar artery. If there's a hemorrhage, Sakun will die.

430
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,520
Interpreter Su. Who is this child to you?

431
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,000
A neighbor.

432
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,540
You didn't have money to pay your fine but had money to pay his medical bills.

433
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,960
Your neighbor is not ordinary.

434
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,800
Are you ready for the next surgery?

435
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,160
No problem.

436
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,300
As a dropout, you know that the cysticercus wall is adhering to the basilar artery.

437
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,650
I'm not a dropout. I graduated with a bachelor's degree.

438
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,540
You were directly admitted to a doctorate

439
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,900
but dropped out midway. Aren't you a dropout?

440
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,200
Since you chose to drop out, why are you still studying these specialized terms?

441
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,040
Su Wei'an. Why did you drop out?

442
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,220
Does it have anything to do with you?

443
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,220
Besides, in this world, there aren't so many reasons.

444
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:15,960
Can you tell me why a grown man like you wears such a strange bracelet daily?

445
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,900
Take her away!

446
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,840
- Let go of me! Listen to me! 
 - What are you guys doing?

447
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,640
I'll pay more to compensate for the General's wine.

448
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,240
Can you afford it?

449
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,620
You've ruined the General's banquet. He is furious. Take her away.

450
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,945
Don't move. Let her go.

451
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,760
Keep holding the knife if you can!

452
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,100
Gu Yunzheng, they have guns. Don't be impulsive.

453
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,200
Tell him that the Friendship Hospital is protected.

454
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,060
Who dares to hurt Chinese citizens here?

455
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,140
And tell him to control himself.

456
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,300
If he accidentally touches my scalpel, he'll get his clothes dirty.

457
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't move. Or you'll die.

458
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,060
Friendship Hospital is protected.

459
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:10,440
I don't believe that. Doctors save lives. How can they kill people?

460
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,540
A surgeon's professional skill is that even if they stab you a hundred times, you won't die.

461
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,480
You'd better stay here forever.

462
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,520

463
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,300
Boss, what happened just now?

464
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,200
Are you idle now?

465
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,140
Have you finished writing the medical records and recording the course of the illness?

466
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,060
I just admire your heroic act. It's a once-in-a-lifetime hero-safe-beauty scene.

467
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,780
Oh no, it's a hero acting for a just cause scene.

468
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,000
Sakun hasn't been discharged yet. His guardian can't be taken away.

469
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,322
Boss.

470
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:05,300
I heard you spent the night with Miss Su at the pharmacy last night.

471
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,860
You spent the night with Dr. Gu?

472
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,980
No, I didn't. He's talking nonsense.

473
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,400
Hey, why are you talking nonsense here?

474
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,600
You're just making things up.

475
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,540
I'm not lying! The pharmacist saw you with her own eyes.

476
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,400
The scene was a mess.

477
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,160
Su Wei'an, explain it to me.

478
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,300
She must have mistaken me for someone else.

479
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm new here. How could she know me?

480
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,260
She wouldn't mistake the boss for someone else, would she?

481
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,580
Wait. I don't mind you accusing me. But how can you throw mud at Dr. Gu?

482
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,020
Go over all the plans for tomorrow's surgery.

483
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,600
Memorize the approach and procedure. I'll do a spot check later.

484
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,190
Hey, Fang Mingfan.

485
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,340
Are you here to provide medical assistance or to gossip?

486
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,960
There's no conflict between the two.

487
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,980
What did you say?

488
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,240
Two tablets at a time, three times a day.

489
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,920
Dr. Fang.

490
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,070
- Interpreter Jiang. 
 - Dr. Fang.

491
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,480
Come over here.

492
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,140
Dr. Fang. Can I ask you something?

493
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,910
Interpreter Jiang. Just call me Mingfan.

494
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,380
- No need to be so polite. 
 - Okay, Mingfan. Let me ask you something.

495
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,680
Does your boss have a girlfriend?

496
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,720
Boss?

497
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,000
Yes.

498
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,740
He's in a relationship? With whom? Is she pretty?

499
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,480
Well, he’s not bad-looking.

500
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,240
But he is a medical expert.

501
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,900
God-like in my boss's eyes. It's not just love.

502
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,600
If she is a medical expert, wouldn't she already be in her seventies?

503
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,610
Can she still be in a relationship with Gu Yunzheng?

504
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,500
Who is she? What's her name?

505
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,140
- Cushing. 
 - Ku Xin?

506
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,440
Is there a girl with the surname Ku here?

507
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,140
Cushing, the father of modern neurosurgery.

508
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,860
Boss is obsessed with him.

509
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,160
You tricked me, Fang Mingfan.

510
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,500
My boss is not dating anyone.

511
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,600
But if you like him, I advise you to give up.

512
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,420
He only cares about medicine.

513
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,480
 If it were possible to matchmake Su Wei'an and her idol,

514
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,340
 when Gu Yunzheng's aid mission ends, they can return to China together.

515
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,360
 Maybe Su Wei'an can regain her passion for medicine.

516
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,720
 Jiang Muying, you're so clever.

517
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,340

518
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,180

519
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,520
Sakun.

520
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,600
Sakun.

521
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,420
What's wrong? It's okay.

522
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,260
I'll give you a checkup.

523
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,750
Sakun. Let me perform a magic trick for you.

524
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,820
Sakun.

525
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,340
Is it cute? Come on. It's for you.

526
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,180
Daddy.

527
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,520
What did you call me?

528
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:53,740
Sakun. Let go of Dr. Gu.

529
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:10,090

530
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,920
