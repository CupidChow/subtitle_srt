2
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,960
'♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

3
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,640
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,160
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,220
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,100
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,980

16
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,980

17
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,920
I'll be off if there's nothing else.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,820
I have to visit the embassy to get an expedited visa.

19
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,140
According to our contract, you need to apply for resignation one week in advance

20
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,800
According to our contract, you need to apply for resignation one week in advance,

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,680
and you can't leave until one week after the date of application.

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,620
During this period,

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
be on your duty as usual.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,820
Absence from duty will lead to a deduction of salary.

25
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,700
Absence from work will lead to a pay cut.

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,880
No problem.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,220
Until this Sunday, right?

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,760
Don't worry, I'll work until the last day.

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
And even if I leave, Jiang Muying can also take over.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
And even if I leave, Jiang Muying can also take over.

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,820
Remember to pay me.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,940

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,200
Wei'an. Perfect timing.

34
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,020
Wei'an. Perfect timing.

35
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,660
Boss wants you to translate all these materials for him. You can't leave until you finish.

36
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,360
Boss wants you to translate all these materials for him. You can't leave until you finish.

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,940
He said this is passing him skills.

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,260
I think he just doesn't want to let you leave.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,580
What's going on with them two?

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,240
Su, excuse me. Sakun's condition has worsened and he's hospitalized again.

41
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,660
We were looking for you everywhere.

42
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,700
Sakun.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,420
Where do you feel sick?

44
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,120
It hurts everywhere.

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,580
Hurts?

46
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,900
Where does it hurt?

47
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,400
Everywhere.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,340
Let me take a look.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,620
Mommy An, don't leave.

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,940
This isn't good then.

51
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,040
Sakun, it looks like this toxin has invaded your entire body.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,860
Sakun, it looks like this toxin has invaded your entire body.

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,600
You need Chinese acupuncture to help you force out the toxins.

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,260
Do you know what acupuncture is?

55
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,780
It's a long needle like this that's inserted into your body.

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,340
It's a long needle like this that's inserted into your body.

57
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,800
It doesn't hurt at all.

58
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,960
Mommy An, my pain has gone away. It’s gone now.

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,160
Sakun.

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,020
I have a disease like yours...

61
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,880
that has no cure.

62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,440
But now, someone has developed a way to cure this disease.

63
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,140
So I have to go to France.

64
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,540
It's my last chance.

65
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,300
Mommy An, don't leave. Don’t.

66
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,820
Don't worry.

67
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,520
I'll come back to see you as soon as I can, okay?

68
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,740
Mommy An. Mommy An.

69
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,480
Here, lie down first.

70
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,020
Jiang Jiang.

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,620
Don't bother with me anymore, I have to go to France.

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,180
If Sakun really becomes ill,

73
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,480
please take good care of him for me.

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,320
Wei'an, Sakun really needs you.

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,680
Friendship Hospital also needs you.

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,900
And Dr. Gu and I, we both really need you.

77
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,140
Please don't leave, okay?

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,700
Right, Dr. Gu?

79
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,980
Dr. Gu.

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
You'll find a better translator soon.

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
I'm not indispensable to Friendship Hospital.

82
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,780
No, how could you—

83
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,540
You're right.

84
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,540
Regardless of who's gone, the Earth will still rotate as usual.

85
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,520
The people that Friendship Hospital needs

86
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,240
aren't only good translators, but more importantly, people who help contribute to long-term stability.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
aren't only good translators, but more importantly, people who help contribute to long-term stability.

88
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,160
We don't need a capricious interpreter who comes and goes as they please.

89
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,880
I've said it before.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,900
You're not suitable for this job.

91
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,220
 Zheng Zheng, I'm sorry.

93
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,740
 I really wants to go back to celebrate your birthday with you, but I still have some unfinished work.

94
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,840
 I really wants to go back to celebrate your birthday with you, but I still have some unfinished work.

95
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,700
 You're a liar. You are a big liar.

96
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
 Zheng Zheng, I will... I'll definitely come back to see you soon.

97
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,760
 Zheng Zheng, I will... I'll definitely come back to see you soon.

98
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,720
 I promise.

99
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,700
 That's what you said last time.

100
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,220
 I don't believe you anymore.

101
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,380
 You're a bad mom.

102
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,900
 Don't bother to come back.

103
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,540
 I don't have a mom like you.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Grandpa.

105
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,980
 Yunzheng, have you eaten yet?

106
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,440
 Yunzheng, have you eaten yet?

107
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,460
 Have you been busy lately?

108
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,800
It's okay. Not too busy.

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,960
Why do you sound unhappy?

110
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,180
 If something happened, you can tell Grandpa.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,620
Grandpa.

112
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,640
I can never understand,

113
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,680
why do the people I want to keep by my side always leave me?

114
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
why do the people I want to keep by my side always leave me?

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,560
Yunzheng, listen to Grandpa. There are some things

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,540
 that you mustn't hold in your heart and keep to yourself.

117
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,240
 You have to speak up and let the other person understand.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,620
You mustn't hold it in just to save face and leave yourself with lifelong regrets. Do you understand?

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,060
You mustn't hold it in just to save face and leave yourself with lifelong regrets. Do you understand?

120
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,680
Grandpa, what are you so happy about?

121
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,760
I just talked to Yunzheng on the phone.

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,600
That kid might be in love with someone.

123
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,140
- In Lakaya? 
 - Yes.

124
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,680
To me, it sounded like...

125
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,340
Scissors.

126
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,140
He is being trapped by love.

127
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,060
I haven't heard of him liking anyone for all these years.

128
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,120
I didn't expect him to find his match abroad.

129
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,440
It would be great if he could bring her back and show us.

130
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,640
Let's just wait and see.

131
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,940
The girl Yunzheng likes can't be bad.

132
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,900
Why is your head so flat?

133
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,820
Why is your head so flat?

134
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,700
Can I just call you Flattie?

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,420
Flattie!

136
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,100
What can we do to make Wei'an stay?

137
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,300
Right now, she's determined to run off with Eliot.

138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't even persuade her.

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,740
Do you have any ideas?

140
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,060
Jiang Jiang.

141
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,640
You wiped all my makeup off, and I even rubbed my lipstick on you.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,180
I didn't even blame you yet.

143
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,540
If I wear this white coat back to the department, Boss will definitely misunderstand and think that I'm dating outside.

144
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,080
If I wear this white coat back to the department, Boss will definitely misunderstand and think that I'm dating outside.

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,600
He won't misunderstand you.

146
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,700
He'll just be jealous of you.

147
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,860
I never thought that one day, I'd make Boss jealous.

148
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,340
Your boss, his looks are really just wasted.

149
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,140
He's so stupid. He's basically loveproof.

150
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,440
I expected him to be able to bring Wei'an back home. I really was thinking too much.

151
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,100
If Su Wei'an just likes Eliot, then what can Boss do?

152
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,140
If Su Wei'an just likes Eliot, then what can Boss do?

153
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,300
I don't believe that elopement nonsense of hers.

154
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,760
No one knows Wei'an better than I do.

155
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,260
She and Gu Yunzheng definitely like each other.

156
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,620
My radar can't be wrong.

157
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,920
I've got it.

158
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,240
I have a way to make Su Wei'an stay.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,760

160
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,900
It's already ten o'clock.

161
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
In addition to the one we're doing later, we've already done five operations today.

162
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,980
We're breaking the record!

163
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,720
Boss, why don't you look tired at all?

164
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,920
- I'm used to it. 
 - True.

165
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,520
With Interpreter Su here, you won't feel tired no matter what.

166
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,980
You won't have many chances left to enjoy this.

167
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,500
If you're tired,

168
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,160
you don't have to work the next operation.

169
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,680
Tell Jiang Muying to come.

170
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,140
There's no need. It's the last one anyway.

171
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,800
Okay.

172
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,740

173
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,380

174
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,160
Boss, here's our medical team's work manual.

175
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,280
Interpreter Su has already finished translating it for you.

176
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Since you assigned the task, check it yourself.

177
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
I can't stay up any longer. I'm going to bed.

178
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,440
You and Interpreter Su can proofread slowly. Take your time.

179
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,520
- I'm leaving. 
 - Fang Mingfan. Hey!

180
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,260
Then you should proofread it carefully.

181
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,400
I don't want to owe you anything.

182
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,560
We can't just stand here though.

183
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,440
Let's go to the office.

184
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,340
Are you sure this will work?

185
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,560
Yes.

186
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,540
The last time they spent one night together at the pharmacy, their relationship immediately blossomed.

187
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,500
The last time they spent one night together at the pharmacy, their relationship immediately blossomed.

188
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,660
We're letting them be in the same room again now.

189
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,180
It's a dry firewood, so it's sure to catch fire immediately.  (TN: Their love for each other will surely be rekindled.)

190
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,980
Why do I feel like it might not work?

191
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,760
There's nothing much we can do now.

192
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,520
Shut off the power after I count three, two, one. Okay?

193
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,120
Okay.

194
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,960

195
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,260
Not bad.

196
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,360
Thanks for your hard work.

197
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,240
No problem, it's my duty.

198
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,160
It took you a long time, right?

199
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
It took a couple nights.

200
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,680
Is anyone there?

201
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,200
There's still people inside.

202
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,800
The power's out.

203
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,960
Is anyone there? We're still here.

204
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
Is anyone there? We're still here.

205
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,500
 Boss, she's going to leave.

206
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,740
 If you don't express your feelings now, it'll be too late.

207
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,620
Is anyone there?

208
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,940
 I can only help you so much. Good luck.

209
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,960
Anybody?

210
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,840
It was Fang Mingfan.

211
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
He did this on purpose.

212
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,540
My flight is this afternoon.

213
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,280
As for my work, I've already handed it over to Jiang Jiang.

214
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,560
 If Jiang Jiang doesn't do well, please take care of her and encourage her.

215
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,470
 If Jiang Jiang doesn't do well, please take care of her and encourage her.

216
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,140
 - I lied to you.  
 - What is Boss saying?

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,540
The reason I want to keep you is not because I lack a translator,

218
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,080
The reason I want to keep you is not because I lack a translator,

219
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,940
and it's not because you can speak French and understand medicine.

220
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,080
When I first met you in Lakaya,

221
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,950
I thought you were a money-grubber.

222
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,840
A deserter who gave up medicine to do business.

223
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,080
But you... you're so familiar with medical terms,

224
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,120
and you're willing to do whatever it takes to save Sakun.

225
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,280
And you also shielded me from clubs and bullets.

226
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,260
Su Wei'an.

227
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,650
Do you remember that night at the pharmacy?

228
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,960
It was as dark as it is now.

229
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,400
And you helped me spell out the letters on the bracelet.

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,440
Under that jacaranda tree, your makeup-free appearance was really pretty.

231
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Under that jacaranda tree, your makeup-free appearance was really pretty.

232
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Dr. Gu.

233
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,740
Don’t overthink it.

234
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,120
All those things you mentioned, I just did them casually.

235
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,220
If it were anyone else, and I am there, I would also protect them.

236
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,320
If it were anyone else, and I am there, I would also protect them.

237
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,900
Wei'an, that New Year's kiss

238
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,990
wasn't just a random kiss.

239
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,420
- I don't want to just be friends with you. 
 - Stop it.

240
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,080
I know what you want to say.

241
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,180
Ever since the New Year's party,

242
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,720
I've known how you feel.

243
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,890
I'm not an idiot.

244
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,680
I can see it in your eyes.

245
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,390
And even more so, I can hear it from your words.

246
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,840
But I'm glad you didn't tell me.

247
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,990
If you didn't,

248
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,200
I can just continue playing dumb.

249
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,300
I just don’t have any long-term potential, neither in studying medicine nor in love.

250
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,260
I just don’t have any long-term potential, neither in studying medicine nor in love.

251
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,520
So no matter what wrong impression I gave you before, the person I like now is Eliot.

252
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,800
So no matter what wrong impression I gave you before, the person I like now is Eliot.

253
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,880
I want to go to Paris with him.

254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,880
Do you understand?

255
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,280
You like Eliot?

256
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,360
Do you really mean it?

257
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,140
If it isn't meant to be, there's no use trying to force it to happen.

258
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,880
It's not worth it for someone like me.

259
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,760
Stop wasting your time on me.

260
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,600
Jiang Jiang, open the door.

261
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I know you're out there.

262
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,200
Jiang Jiang.

263
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,120
Are you asleep?

264
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,880
This is a smart recording pen.

265
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,420
The terms in the dictionary that are marked with stickers are all commonly used terms in neurosurgery.

266
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,040
The terms in the dictionary that are marked with stickers are all commonly used terms in neurosurgery.

267
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
And that ointment.

268
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,540
It's used to relieve itching.

269
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,640
They all say it works very well.

270
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,080
Jiang Jiang.

271
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,400
Fang Mingfan treats you very well.

272
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,120
You should cherish him.

273
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,020
 Jiang Jiang,

274
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,240
 I'm sorry.

275
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,660
 There are some things I don't know how to tell you.

276
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,560
 I have to find a cure before I start having symptoms.

277
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,560
 So I have to go to France.

278
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,160

279
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,100
- Filament. 
 - Filament.

280
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,920
- Filament. 
 - Filament.

281
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,360
- Hemostatic gel. 
 - Hemostatic gel.

282
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,480
- Hemostatic gel. 
 - Hemostatic gel.

283
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,700
The bleeding has stopped.

284
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,760
Fang Mingfan, close up the skull.

285
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,240
Okay.

286
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,280
Boss, this is the last surgery for today.

287
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
Leave the rest to me. You can go first.

288
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,260
Go where?

289
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,160
Wei'an should be already on her way.

290
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,280
An, are you feeling unwell?

291
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,960
We'll arrive at the airport soon.

292
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,300
No, I'm just thinking...

293
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,720
In the materials you showed me, the changes in the mice that went through cell transplantation were really obvious.

294
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,800
In the materials you showed me, the changes in the mice that went through cell transplantation were really obvious.

295
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,620
Dr. Marta's research should enter clinical trials soon, right?

296
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,600
Dr. Marta's research should enter clinical trials soon, right?

297
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,140
I think so.

298
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,580
What's the matter?

299
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,880
Did the experiment make new progress?

300
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,960
Or did it run into a bottleneck?

301
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,380
Actually, there are many world-class labs in Paris.

302
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,240
Dr. Marta also has a more promising research project on brain-computer interface.

303
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,040
If you're interested, I can make arrangements for you.

304
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,920
What do you mean?

305
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,220
You know that I only want to be a part of the Huntington's disease program.

306
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,440
You know that I only want to be a part of the Huntington's disease program.

307
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,880
The Huntington's disease project team's progress is very slow.

308
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,340
You can join other experimental groups while waiting for the Huntington's disease project to enter clinical trials.

309
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,280
You can join other experimental groups while waiting for the Huntington's disease project to enter clinical trials.

310
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,860
- Then you can switch back. 
 - No, I can't wait. Not even for a moment.

311
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,740
Why not?

312
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,040
Why does it have to be the Huntington's disease project?

313
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,760
Why are you following me?

314
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,780
Wei'an left this for you.

315
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,180
 Please run an enhanced head CT scan as soon as possible.

316
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,100
 Brainstem mass. Multimodal MRI, high-grade glioma is considered likely.

317
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,020
 Brainstem mass. Multimodal MRI,

318
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,880
 high-grade glioma is considered likely.

319
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,440
This is a smart recording pen.

320
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Just say a keyword and the corresponding French word will come up.

321
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,000
Wei'an used your work manual to summarize your most commonly used words.

322
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,580
And she stayed up for several nights to record this.

323
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,680
The road to the airport should be very busy right now.

324
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,280
I think taking a motorbike will be faster.

325
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,100
What do you mean?

326
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,280
What I mean is, if you don't leave now, you won't be able to catch up with her.

327
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
What I mean is, if you don't leave now, you won't be able to catch up with her.

328
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,880
She said she must go to France with Eliot.

329
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,980
Why should I chase her?

330
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,580
This question... you can only ask yourself.

331
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,660
You know what, Dr. Gu?

332
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,080
Wei'an once had a textbook with your name written all over it.

333
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,360
When I found it, she explained to me that it was because she wanted to be a doctor like you.

334
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,180
When I found it, she explained to me that it was because she wanted to be a doctor like you.

335
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,380
But do you believe her?

336
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:05,320
I've never even seen a single doctor write Hippocrates's name all over a book.

337
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,780
Although I... Dr. Gu!

338
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,060
I don't know why she's going to France, but it certainly isn't because of Eliot.

339
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,820
♫  Your secret  ♫

340
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,800
♫  Luckliy, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

341
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,580
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,560
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

344
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,820
 Don't even think about getting closer to Dr. Gu. Unless I'm dead.

345
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,620
♫  I've forgotten that I was lonely once  ♫

346

357
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,080
An,

358
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,256
your attention to and understanding of chorea is unusual.

359
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:24,156
Is the person who's sick really just a friend?

360
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:46,180

361
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,240
Cytosine, adenine, and guanine amplification numbers are greater than 40.

362
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,800
Carries the gene that causes Huntington's disease.

363
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,880
An, it's you.

364
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,240
So you know why now.

365
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,860
This is the only reason why I'm going to Paris.

366
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,880
I'm sorry, An.

367
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,580
I can't take you to Paris like this.

368
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,340
Why?

369
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
Eliot, I just want to participate in Dr. Marta's experiment.

370
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Eliot, I just want to participate in Dr. Marta's experiment.

371
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,240
I definitely won't pester you.

372
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,770
- You don't need to be burdened at all. 
 - The experiment failed again.

373
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,850
This project has been terminated. I'm sorry.

374
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,200
Terminated?

375
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
I'm sorry, An. I lied to you.

376
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,620
But according to the information you showed me, the experiments are going very smoothly.

377
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,360
But according to the information you showed me, the experiments are going very smoothly.

378
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,420
Why did it get terminated?

379
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,700
The video I showed you was three months after taking the medicine.

380
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,300
But in fact, after six months, the mouse mortality rate exceeded 60%.

381
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,060
The test still failed.

382
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,340
An, I'm sorry.

383
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,760
I wanted to take you to Paris so much.

384
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I was so focused on the thought that the air of romance in Paris would create beautiful chemistry between you and me.

385
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,600
I was so focused on the thought that the air of romance in Paris would create beautiful chemistry between you and me.

386
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,040
But I didn't expect...

387
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,860
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,440
It's okay.

389
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,800
I should be used to disappointment by now.

390
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,040
I guess this is the real script.

391
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,420
Don't worry, it's okay.

392
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,840
A genetic test report won't change anything if you're still willing to go to Paris with me.

393
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,680
A genetic test report won't change anything if you're still willing to go to Paris with me.

394
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,700
Boarding pass. Please show your boarding pass.

395
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,600
Wei'an?

396
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,800
Wei'an.

397
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,500
This is great.

398
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
I finally caught up to you.

399
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,500
Wei'an, don't go anymore. Okay?

400
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,660
What's the matter, Wei'an?

401
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,340
Where's Eliot?

402
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,545
- He left. 
 - He left?

403
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,500
Why did he leave you here alone?

404
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,780
What happened?

405
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,700
Nothing.

406
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,100
I just suddenly didn't want to go anymore.

407
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,900
You don't want to go anymore?

408
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,480
That's good.

409
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,140
I'll take you back then.

410
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,920
Go back...

411
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,840
Where else can I go back to?

412
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,800
Right. I... I found your motorcycle.

413
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,060
Right. I... I found your motorcycle.

414
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,680
Right. I... I found your motorcycle.

415
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,600
I searched all over Lakaya, and when I found it, it was pretty much destroyed.

416
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
I searched all over Lakaya, and when I found it, it was pretty much destroyed.

417
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,140
So I fixed it piece by piece.

418
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,380
Can you fix anything that's broken?

419
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,190
Sure.

420
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,000
I can fix anything.

421
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,740
Can you fix me, then?

422
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,120
What?

423
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,700
It's nothing.

424
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,060
Wei'an!

425
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,030
I'm returning it to its original owner.

426
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,150
From now on, don't lose it anymore.

427
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,680
That's not right.

428
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,105
I've replaced most of the parts on this motorcycle,

429
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:18,500
so we can say that it's our joint property now.

430
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,120
It's yours for daily use, but from time to time,

431
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,940
you can also give your busy leader a ride.

432
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,500
Thanks.

433
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,600
Wei'an.

434
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,000
If you really want to go to France, we will have many opportunities in the future.

435
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,460
If you really want to go to France, we will have many opportunities in the future.

436
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,700
You can still make money here.

437
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,320
I'll help you with whatever you want to do.

438
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,580
You dropped something!

439
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,060
You can't hold a child so tightly!

440
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,000
- What's wrong? 
 - Wei'an!

441
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,460
I don't know what's going on either.

442
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,440
My child.

443
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,460
Have you seen my child?

444
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,940
My child is missing.

445
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,900
I lost my baby.

446
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,820
This toy, is it yours?

447
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,720
It's a human trafficker.

448
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,900
What? Wei'an!

449
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,920
Wei'an! Where are you going?

450
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,980
Human trafficker.

451
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,000
Wei'an just said that man is a human trafficker!

452
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,500
Hurry, call the police.

453
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,780
There was a human trafficker at Friendship Hospital.

454
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,480
Please hurry and send someone to arrest him.

455
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,400
Hello?

456
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,940
Why did the police hang up on me?

457
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,600
If the police in Lakaya were effective, human traffickers wouldn't be so rampant.

458
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,520
Then... what should we do now?

459
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,860
Faster, faster!

460
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,600
Sit tight.

461
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,720
Be careful.

462
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,760
Give us the child!

463
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,520
Who are you?

464
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,800
Give me the child.

465
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,300
Crazy lady.

466
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,260
Do you want to die?

467
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,200
Do you want to die? How dare you make a scene on my turf?

468
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,640
Yes, I want to die. Give me the child!

469
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,940
Don't be reckless. The child may get hurt.

470
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,980
How much? I'll buy the child.

471
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,080
Can you afford it?

472
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,620
Give me all the money you have on you.

473
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,380
- Why? 
 - To buy the baby.

474
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,840
Su Wei'an, is there any kind of business you don’t do?

475
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
If we don't buy the child, someone else will.

476
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,480
Hurry up.

477
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,360
$10,000 USD, in cash.

478
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
That's so much.

479
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,840
I only have this much.

480
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,720
That's not enough.

481
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,240
Alipay. Is Alipay okay?

482
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,340
Are you kidding me? What kind of joke is this?

483
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,940
- Get out of here! 
 - Wait!

484
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,320
I really have money.

485
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,000
Su Wei'an.

486
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,010
This phone, plus some money. A deposit.

487
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,720
- You stay. You go back and get the money. 
 - No. I'll stay, and he'll go.

488
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,940
He's richer than me.

489
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,690
What are you saying?

490
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,560
Gu Yunzheng, I'll count to three.

491
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Run away quickly and don't look back.

492
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,920
Su Wei'an, quit your personal heroism.

493
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,760
We came together, so we'll leave together.

494
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,120
Boss, what's wrong with this child?

495
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,340
Oh no.

496
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,580
This child has turned purple!

497
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,820
He needs to be taken back to a hospital.

498
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,360
I'll give these to you, so give me the child. Quickly!

499
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,820
Hurry, we have to catch them this time.

500
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,200
- It's the General's people. 
 - Kill them!

501
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,860
Watch out!

502
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,080
Su Wei'an!

503
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,160
- Su Wei'an! 
 - Don't move! Squat down!

504
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,920
Su Wei'an!

505
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,420
Wei'an!

506
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,300
Don't move! Squat down!

507
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,860
Hurry!

508
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,120
Wei'an!

509
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,800
- Wei'an! 
- Wei'an!

510
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,720
Boss.

511
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,780
Fang Mingfan, take that child to the hospital first and tell the emergency room to give him a full body check-up.

512
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,440
Fang Mingfan, take that child to the hospital first and tell the emergency room to give him a full body check-up.

513
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,320
Okay.

514
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,020
Jiang Jiang, my bag.

515
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,660
My bag is still on the motorcycle.

516
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,480
- Wei'an! 
 - Give all my money to my mom.

517
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,160
My death insurance can finally come in handy.

518
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,480
Wei'an.

519
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,520
Come help us!

520
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,460
Wei'an, wake up.

521
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,840
Dr. Gu, will Wei'an…

522
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,280
Start the car!

523
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,820
Hurry!

524
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,500
- Take it easy. 
 - Hang in there, Wei'an!

525
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,140
Dr. Gu, how did Interpreter Su get hurt?

526
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,940
Half an hour ago, she sustained a stab wound to the left upper abdomen.

527
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,100
Estimated blood loss of more than 800cc.

528
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
No obvious organ protrusion was seen.

529
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,080
Does she have any family here?

530
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,800
Who will sign the papers?

531
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,640
I'll sign them.

532
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,020
- Here, take it easy. 
 - Careful.

533
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,300
- Slowly. 
 - Okay, lift.

534
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
We'll take care of her.

535
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,840
Be careful!

536
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,700
Be careful.

537
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,280
Dr. Xu, the patient is in hemorrhagic shock.

538
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,480
Dr. Xu, the patient is in hemorrhagic shock.

539
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,700
- You must assess the injury to the abdominal cavity. 
 - Okay, I got it.

540
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:10,980
Also, her wound is close to the spleen, so you must carefully check for any internal organ damage.

541
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,740
- Also— 
 - Dr. Gu,

542
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,600
I'm also a professional surgeon.

543
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,020
Don't worry and leave Interpreter Su to me.

544
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,100
Go and take a rest.

545
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,760
I'm fine.

546
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,680
I'll just wait here.

547
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,780
Dr. Gu, there's nothing you can help with here.

548
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,640
Just leave it to me.

549
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,000
Dr. Xu, we're relying on you!

550
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,500
Dr. Xu, you must save Wei'an!

551
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,820
Hello?

552
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,500
 Boss, I did a head CT scan for the child and ruled out craniocerebral injuries.

553
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,240
 Boss, I did a head CT scan for the child and ruled out craniocerebral injuries.

554
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,140
 I checked with the child’s mother, and there is no past medical history.

555
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,720
 The emergency doctor did a full physical exam, and he's fine now.

556
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,940
 By the way, what about Interpreter Su? How is she?

557
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,060
She just entered the operating room.

558
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,760
I'll keep you updated with any news.

559
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,400
 My death insurance can finally come in handy.

560
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,340
Dr. Gu, what are you doing?

561
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,860

562
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,460

563
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,540
Dr. Gu!

564
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,860

565
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,500

566
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,700

567
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,180

568
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,660
This is the death insurance policy Su Wei'an was talking about.

569
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,880
Dr. Gu, what are you doing?

570
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,440
Wei'an isn't dead yet.

571
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,520

572
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,300

573
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,880
 I also hope that with Professor Gu’s good advice, I can live to be 60 years old.

574
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,980
 Your life is worth more than mine.

575
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,060
 If you're alive, you can also save more lives.

576
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,600
 If he died, I would've compensated him with my life.

577
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,700
 Don't even think about getting closer to Dr. Gu. Unless I'm dead.

578
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,520
 Yes, I want to die. Give me the child!

579
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,540
 Su Wei'an, why do you want to die so badly?

580
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,020
Has Su Wei'an... had any illness before?

581
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,100
No.

582
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,540
What about her family?

583
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,900
Do any genetic diseases run in her family?

584
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,600
No.

585
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:10,020

586
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,940
