16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,600

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,760
That's not good. I'm still at the hospital now.

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,120
Why would the police have my blood test result?

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,340
Where was that nosy Chinese woman from? I better not see her again.

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,485
These are your medicine for five days.

21
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,765
- Okay. 
 - I got it.

22
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,705
- Hi. 
 - Are you the Chinese woman who saved me?

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,640
No, I'm not. But she's a friend of mine.

24
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,320
Where can I find her?

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,040
Why are you looking for her?

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,831
For thanking her, of course. She saved my life.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,960
- Her name is Su Wei'an. She also works in this hospital. 
 - Dr. Gu, take a look.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,860
Rest well.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,640
Tell him that he recovered well after the operation. He can be discharged anytime.

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,960
Okay.

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,280
- You're recovering well. 
 - Dr. Gu, this is his list of expenses. He can be discharged after paying.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,020
This is his list of expenses.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,520
This is your list of expenses.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,040

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,960
My God. Why does it cost so much?

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,180
Where can I get the money to pay you? Why did you save me?

37
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,620
I shouldn't be the one to pay for this.

38
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,500
It should be paid by that Chinese woman who saved me.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,260
- Where is she? Where? Why did she save me? 
 - He's crazy.

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,100
Where? Why did she save me?

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,420
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,460
But is Wei'an going to be okay? I just told him Wei'an saved him.

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,360
Why did you tell him?

44
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
He... He asked me.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,675
Tell him that I signed the treatment bill. I gave the blood test report to the police.

46
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:14,140
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,460
Interpret as I said.

48
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,200
What did he say?

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,360
It's Dr. Gu who gave your blood test report to the police.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,240
It's you?

51
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,440
Come on. Go ahead and hit me.

52
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,300
Come on.

53
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,380
Don't touch me! What are you doing?

54
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,380
Let go of me! What are you doing?

55
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,200
Let go of me! Let me find that woman!

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Are you that Chinese woman? Why did you save me?

57
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,220
- Gosh. Dr. Gu, were you okay just now? 
 - I'm okay.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,820
What's going on?

59
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,000
Wei'an, the man you saved... He's a lunatic.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,260
He couldn't afford the medical bill and even blamed you for saving him.

61
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm sorry. I was careless and told him it was you who saved him.

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,739
Does this man have some sort of sequela from the surgery, or is there still a clot in his brain?

63
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,840
Indeed.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,820
The operation was successful. All clots have been cleared.

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,900
He can be discharged anytime.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,980
You knew he was DUI and hit someone, yet you still did a good job on him.

67
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,040
As a doctor, I'm not to judge who deserves to die. I only save lives.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,100
Besides, aren't you the one who saved that patient?

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Dr. Gu, didn't you ask me to tell that man that

70
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,760
you gave the blood test result to the police?

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,640
Why are you saying this to Wei'an now?

72
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,738
You're injured.

73
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:15,638
Does it hurt?

74
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,940
Wei'an, didn't you say that a surgeon's hands are more precious than gold?

75
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,240
What shall we do?

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,580
- I... I'm fine. It's okay. 
 - How could it be okay? You're bleeding a lot.

77
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,065
- Let's go. Dr. Gu. 
 - Wei'an. Treat Dr. Gu now.

78
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:31,000
- You should bind the wound up fast. 
 - I'm fine.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,340
- Come on. Let's go. 
 - Wei'an, go with him.

80
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,760
Forget it.

81
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,785
The head nurse is more professional. I'll leave it to her.

82
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,800
You're simply beyond help.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,040

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,740
Boss, these are the French interpreters I selected.

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,840
All with overseas experience.

86
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,500
Just put them there.

87
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,740
This one looks good. Twenty-eight years old.

88
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,860
A French major from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

89
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,760
Pursued graduate study in Paris.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,220
Can a girl who studied in Paris bear with the hardships in Lakaya?

91
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,580
This one. This one's 44 years old.

92
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,020
Looks like a hardworking type. How about him?

93
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,320
At his age, he probably has a whole family to care for, do you think he'll leave them behind?

94
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,860
How about this one? This one...

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,680
Enough, Fang Mingfan.

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,420
You must take your time looking for a French interpreter.

97
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,720
Rushing leads to delays.

98
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,260
It's not that easy to find a good fit.

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,900
So, let's put quality before quantity.

100
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,880
Put quality before quantity.

101
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,580
Previously, you told me to quickly find someone new to replace the temporary Interpreter Su.

102
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,020
Now you're in no hurry. You want me to do it slowly.

103
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,880
You're so unpredictable, Boss.

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,800
Anything else?

105
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,760
Boss, come on. Take a look at this.

106
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,160
Actually, I think that all of them are qualified.

107
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,960
These two are no worse than Interpreter Su.

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,140
Why don't you pick two as backups? In case Interpreter Su leaves one day.

109
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,860
Interpreters don't make too much money, after all.

110
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,980
- These two, huh? Okay then. 
 - Yeah.

111
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,580
If you really think they're good, I can consider replacing Interpreter Jiang.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,100
That won't be necessary.

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm happy with our current interpreters. Interpreter Su is quite good.

114
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,180
No need to replace her. Bye, Boss.

115
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,310

116
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,080
Here, Wei'an.

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,500
This is the vitality tea that Dr. Gu told me to make for you.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,840
You'll be full of energy after drinking it.

119
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,940
Seriously?

120
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,260
 See? She still needs my help.

121
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,780
- It's good. 
 - Right?

122
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,900
- What is this? 
 - Cabinda bark.

123
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,880
What's wrong with you?

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
What happened?

125
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,720
Cabinda bark?

126
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,580
Yeah.

127
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Well...

128
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,680
Stop drinking.

129
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,540
- What? 
 - This is for enhancing male functions.

130
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,620
Are you sure Gu Yunzheng wants me to drink this?

131
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,020
I had no idea.

132
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,520
Dr. Gu must have been fooled by the ads.

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,380
Let me ask him about it. I'm going to ask him.

134
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,980
Dr. Gu.

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,520
What's this?

136
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,040
Considering that your injured hand cannot get wet,

137
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,940
Wei'an washed and folded your clothes. She had me deliver them to you.

138
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
Why doesn't she send them herself?

139
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,420
You know, Wei'an is shy and feels embarrassed.

140
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,560
Just keep silent about it.

141
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Don't ever ask her in person. She'll blame me.

142
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,690
Tell her she did a great job. But don't do such things again.

143
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,340
Jiang Jiang,

144
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,140
did you really give Interpreter Su a cup of Cabinda bark tea?

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,020
It's over.

146
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,320
You've ruined my boss's perfect image.

147
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,740
How was I supposed to know?

148
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,560
I saw the ad at the stall saying prolonging youth and anti-fatigue.

149
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,600
So I just bought some. Who would have known?

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,420
Why did you do such things anyway?

151
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,880
It was because of me that Wei'an became the target of that driver,

152
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,520
and Dr. Gu's hand was injured. I wanted to do something for them.

153
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,420
And I know Su Wei'an too well.

154
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,900
Only God knows when she'll make the first move.

155
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,340
But you're not helping at all.

156
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,440
You think I don't know?

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,720
This is so frustrating. I only wanted to make it up to them.

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,480
But now things have gotten worse.

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,320
Jiang Jiang, it's okay.

160
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,940
With a friend like you helping her, Su Wei'an will only be happy about it.

161
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,200
I think you're adorable.

162
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
I want someone like you to be my girl...

163
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,320
I mean, friend. Friend.

164
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Aren't we friends already?

165
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,600
Boss's hand is about to recover. How long am I going to wash clothes for him?

166
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,680
Till they tie the knot and are of one mind forever.

167
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,580
Okay.

168
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,920
Stop.

169
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,000
Boss, aren't you going out for fun on the weekend?

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,920
What's wrong with your T-shirt?

171
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,500
What?

172
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,300
- What? 
 - Did Su Wei'an wash it for you, too?

173
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,820
Yes.

174
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,120
Yes or not?

175
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,660
Who did you say I washed clothes for?

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,560
That explains it.

177
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Interpreter Su values money over anything. I was wondering why would she wash clothes for someone for free.

178
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,060
You're right. For someone like Dr. Gu Yunzheng,

179
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,340
his body must be so strong if he drinks Cabinda bark daily.

180
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,880
Why would he need someone else to do such labor for him?

181
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,800
When did I drink Cabinda bark?

182
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:37,140
Jiang Muying, I'll settle the scores when we're back.

183
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,640
Interpreter Su's time is precious. I can't afford to waste any.

184
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,120
From now on, stop doing such things on my behalf.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,980
Dr. Gu is a busy man. From now on, I won't need Dr. Gu's help.

186
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
Follow me.

187
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,900
Lady Su, please have tea.

188
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,500
What tea is it this time?

189
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,240
Your Ladyship, this tea is bought and made all by your humble servant.

190
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,860
There won't be any problem at all.

191
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,780
Fine, you may kowtow and leave.

192
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,840
Are you not mad at me, Your Ladyship?

193
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,940
If that happens again, I'll give you  beating.

194
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,040
Did you get lost in your own acting? Do you really think you're the lady, huh?

195
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,720
Listen, if you ever be mean to me again, I'll give you a beating, did you hear me?

196
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
You're being mean.

197
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,340
November 1. Isn't that tomorrow? What's so important about tomorrow?

198
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,400
It's the day when Lakaya champion coffee beans are open for sale on the market.

199
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,840
It starts at 7 a.m. First come first served.

200
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,860
And there's only one day in a year. Whether I get rich or not depends on it.

201
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,600
Then let me go with you. Take me as your assistant.

202
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,520
You're talking as if you really would do it. Can you get up on time?

203
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,240
Then wake me up! Just... Wake me up by beating.

204
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,100
Okay. I will go to bed now. I can definitely get up on time.

205
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,380
Remember to wake me up.

206
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,980
 The day hasn't even broken yet. Is she sleepwalking?

207
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,460

208
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,880
How much for taking me to 69th Avenue?

209
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,100
It's still dark. You'll have to pay double.

210
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,900
That's too expensive. The sky is already bright.

211
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,540
Save it. I don't bargain.

212
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,440
 Where is she going so early?

213
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,910
- Never mind. 
 - Su Wei'an.

214
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,910

215
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,280
It's so early in the morning. Where are you going?

216
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,060
I don't think I need to report my whereabouts to you.

217
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,523
What about you?

218
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:33,208
I... I'm out for a morning jog.

219
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,400
That doctor went toward the plaza.

220
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,820
The station is right ahead. Is this your everyday morning jog route?

221
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,020
Where exactly are you going so early in the morning?

222
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,120
- To the morning market. 
 - What morning market?

223
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,760
Today's the annual coffee beans contest.

224
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,180
I'm going to get the right of agency of the champion beans in China. I can't be late for that.

225
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,180
You're all about making money, huh?

226
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,140
Go back to rest. Your first operation starts at 8:30.

227
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,040
You are also aware of that, huh? You'll be fined if you're late.

228
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,860
Don't worry. I would never delay an operation.

229
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,320
I... I'll watch you get on the bus.

230
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,020
The bus stop is just up ahead. Go back to rest.

231
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,840
Then I'll jog to the bus stop.

232
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,880
Suit yourself.

233
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,979
Stop following me.

234
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
There seems to be someone up ahead. Something's not right.

235
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,600
Are you kidding? Bad things happen whenever I run into you.

236
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
Let's go.

237
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,360
You made Paj lose so much money. Neither of you will get away today.

238
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,300
Paj? Who's that?

239
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,860
That driver you saved.

240
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,080
Calm down.

241
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,000
You admitted to them that you gave the blood test result to the police.

242
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,260
Why?

243
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,980
Don't you know why? I was worried that he might get back at you.

244
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,440
Why am I so unlucky? Why does someone like you follow me?

245
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Now, not only am I unable to make money, but my down payment has been for nothing.

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,780
Su Wei'an, you...

247
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,580
Watch out!

248
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,340
Stop! All you want is money, right? I'll give money to you.

249
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,360
Go now!

250
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,560
Go! The police are here.

251
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,060
Su Wei'an! Su Wei'an!

252
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,900
Is your hand okay?

253
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,900
My hand is okay.

254
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,580
Doctor on duty! Who's the doctor on duty?

255
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,900
- Come on.
- Boss, what happened?

256
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,080
Give her a CT scan now. She was hit on the back side of her head.

257
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,820
- Check for the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage. Hurry! 
 - Okay.

258
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,140
 I like him.

259
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,580

260
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,320
President Du, although our data from the phase II

261
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,920
experiment is not as ideal as expected, everything is within control.

262
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:23,220
I believe that as long as the next phase fund is ready, we can still carry out the clinical test as per our original plan

263
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,500
It's still too slow. Can we speed things up?

264
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,440
I hope that we can start clinical tests this year.

265
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,240
Scientific researchers must obey objective laws.

266
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,720
I told you this back when you decided to invest in HDQ39.

267
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,320
That's why we can't be overhasty.

268
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,320
Dad, Yuncheng is one of us. Please try to understand the pressure he's under.

269
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,580
Don't you know how much wine he's drunk with investors to raise funds for you?

270
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,520
President Du, my answer is still the same. Scientific researchers must obey objective laws.

271
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,280
We have to remain serious and rigorous.

272
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,980
So, what we're researching is medicine, not other things.

273
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,520
I understand. You're an expert in the field of chorea in China.

274
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,080
I fully trust you in terms of the scientific matters.

275
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,920
As for the fund, you won't need to worry about that.

276
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,560
All right.

277
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,100
-  Is your hand okay?  
 -  My hand is okay.

278
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,620
 You're injured.

279
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,420
 Does it hurt?

280
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,380

281
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,120
Boss, thank goodness there's no intracranial hemorrhage. Just a mild concussion.

282
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,400
You can rest assured now.

283
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,160
You're injured, too?

284
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,140
 Your compositions are all made up, huh?

285
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,540
 Where's your engineer mom? Why didn't she ever show up?

286
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,285
 Could it be you don't have one?

287
00:22:47,285 --> 00:22:50,920
 A motherless child is like a blade of grass.

288
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,960
 Your mom abandoned you. You're a blade of grass!

289
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,720
 Don't talk about my mom like that!

290
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,280
 My mom is in Lakaya. She'll be back soon!

291
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,860
 How dare you push him? Beat him!

292
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,520
 She clearly abandoned you! You're just a blade of grass.

293
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,100
 You are a motherless kid!

294
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,580
 You got into a fight again?

295
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,420
 They said that I don't have a mother.

296
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:32,369
 Don't let me see you lose again.

297
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,100
 Dad, it hurts.

298
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,780
 Tears are the most useless thing in this world.

299
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:11,260
 Why? Why would she risk her life to protect me?

300
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,400

301
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
Jiang Jiang.

302
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,700
Scallion Pancakes. Fresh out of the cafeteria.

303
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,460
What? You don't like these?

304
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,880
Wei'an is still suffering.

305
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm supposed to feel sorry for her and shouldn't eat for three days.

306
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,400
But when I see your scallion Pancake,

307
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,100
I still want to eat them. They smell so good.

308
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,980
How can I be such a foodie?

309
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,240
Just eat.

310
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
It's okay. Su Wei'an has woken up.

311
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,580
Besides, Boss has been watching her.

312
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,520
But, if not for my being talkative back then, she wouldn't get injured at all.

313
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,560
According to your logic, if not for Boss being such good a doctor and curing that hit-and-run driver,

314
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,620
if not for this Friendship Hospital being built near where
the car accident happened,

315
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:38,120
if not for me doing an alcohol blood test for that driver,

316
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,960
if not for the liquor store selling liquor to the driver...

317
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,500
According to your logic, Su Wei'an would never get injured.

318
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,180
Why don't you say that if not for Godzilla saving the earth, Su Wei'an would never get injured?

319
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,880
That makes sense. I'll add that next time.

320
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,340
Thanks. For coming here to comfort me.

321
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,710
Wait a second.

322
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,280
 Now is the perfect timing for Wei'an and Dr. Gu to grow fond of each other.

323
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:26,200
 Although this is a bit far from the damsel in distress scenario, the actual effect seems even better.

324
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,460
 Jiang Muying, you're not the trouble causer, but the Cupid of love!

325
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,160
Gu Yunzheng...

326
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,380

327
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,230
How come you're here? Where's Jiang Jiang?

328
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,240
You were calling my name. Did you dream of me?

329
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,340
No.

330
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,860
Then why did you call my name?

331
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,920
I... I wanted to say that I don't owe you money anymore.

332
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,740
What?

333
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,360
Didn't you pay the fine for me at the police station?

334
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,300
Now, I am no longer in control of my life.

335
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,820
My down and final payments are all gone. And I'm injured.

336
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:49,340
This is enough for you to repay me several times.

337
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,040
If you had not gone to buy those coffee beans, you wouldn't be chased by the bad guys.

338
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,640
Those...

339
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,660
Careful.

340
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,840
Those bad guys were obviously after you.

341
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,880
You... You protected me with your life.

342
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,000
Is it because my life is valuable?

343
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,720
Yeah. Your life values more than mine.

344
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,580
You can save more people if you live on.

345
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:49,160
Su Wei'an, don't do such things again.

346
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,320
No one's life is more valuable than another.

347
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,320
- Jiang Jiang. 
 -  You're awake.

348
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,170
Dr. Gu, you've been watching her all this while?

349
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,140
Thanks. That is so considerate.

350
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,180
What do you mean, considerate?

351
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,540
He's my attending doctor. Isn't it his job to get to know his patients?

352
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,840
Would you help get rid of the messy things on her head later,

353
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,940
in case she gets a wound infection?

354
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,680
Doctor's advice.

355
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,260
Okay.

356
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,940
Wei'an.

357
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,840
I wish I was the one who got injured. It must hurt after bleeding so much.

358
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I'm fine. You know I'm not afraid of pain.

359
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,680
Don't do this anymore. Stay at home and don't go anywhere.

360
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,820
I got it.

361
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:24,680
By the way, don't tell my mom about this. She'll be worried sick.

362
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,940
I won't.

363
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,740
Dr. Gu's advice is so good. I've disliked your messy braids for a while now.

364
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,520
Give me back my pretty medical student.

365
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,840
Jiang Muying, which side are you on?

366
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,745
Well, Dr. Gu has been waiting for you to wake up. He cares about you a lot.

367
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,260
Isn't it the most normal thing for a doctor to care about his patient?

368
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,040
Then what about you? Is it also normal to take a hit for Dr. Gu?

369
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
What do you mean to take a hit for him?

370
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
I did not. That's called having nowhere else to duck.

371
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,460
You know I suffered a huge loss this time.

372
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,220
I think Gu Yunzheng and I aren't suitable.

373
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,840
Whenever I meet him, I'll either lose money or get injured.

374
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,600
Oh yeah?

375
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,420
Maybe Dr. Gu doesn't think so.

376
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:35,660
For saving his life, he'd have to repay you with marriage.

377
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,320
Marriage your foot!

378
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,480
Hold on a second. I'm the one who got injured, but why have you suffered from brain trauma?

379
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,860
Repay me with marriage? You're giving me headaches.

380
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,900
All right, I won't say that again. Be gone, headaches.

381
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,640
Wei'an, you know what?

382
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,220
The odds of us running into true love are just three out of a million.

383
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,180
So if you run into them, you must seize it and not let go.

384
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,160
Only three out of a million?

385
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,680
This probability is lower than getting cancer.

386
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,960
No wonder love and death are the eternal themes of humans.

387
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,140
Death and cancer? Enough of the nonsense.

388
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:35,060
Fine. I shouldn't mention these.

389
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,640
You're no longer my friend if you ever talk about these again.

390
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,380

391
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
 Gu Yunzheng...

392
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,420
 I've tried many combinations but can't get a complete meaning out of it.

393
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,120
 Okay, it's done.

394
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,790
 Charcoal ash.

395
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,040
 You... You protected me with your life. Is it because my life is valuable?

396
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,880
 Your life values more than mine.

397
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,640
 You can save more people if you live on.

398
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,520
This crazy woman. What exactly runs through her mind?

399
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,480
She just died like this?

400
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,800
The heroine did so much for him. And she even died for him in the end.

401
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,520
How could it end this?

402
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,040
- She didn't confess her love to the hero even till death. 
 - So sad.

403
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,560
D-Dr. Gu, we're not slacking.

404
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,840
You know, it's passed working hours. Please don't tell our head nurse.

405
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,660
Let me ask you something.

406
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,500
About that woman.

407
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,120
Why would she die for the hero?

408
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,500
Because of love!

409
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,940
She is madly in love with the hero. She'd never let him get hurt.

410
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,660
She'd rather sacrifice herself to protect the hero.

411
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,700
Then, after doing so much for the hero, why wouldn't she admit it to him anyway?

412
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,640
 - Gu Yunzheng... 
 - You were calling my name.

413
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,100
 No.

414
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,220
That's because all women say one thing but mean another.

415
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,880
 I wanted to say that I don't owe you money anymore.

416
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,820
No matter how much she loves a man, she will never take the initiative to say it.

417
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,500
Whoever says it first loses.

418
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,280
- Really? 
 - Of course. That's what happens in all TV dramas.

419
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,503
Dr. Gu, I know so much more than you about this.

420
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,120
I see.

421
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Dr. Gu, we should go now.

422
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,340
Afraid of losing.

423
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,060
It smells so good.

424
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,160
What a small world, Dr. Gu.

425
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,580
What are you doing here?

426
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,420
Well... I just got off work.

427
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,200
Have you been here for a long time?

428
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,820
I didn't want to disturb you from enjoying the flowers on a moonlit night.

429
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,680
They're quite beautiful.

430
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,200
You also like Jacaranda, huh?

431
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,600
I mean... You look beautiful.

432
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,420
Um, well…

433
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,100
It's getting late. You should go rest.

434
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:12,460
 I mean... You look beautiful.

435
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,680
 Su Wei'an, why are you acting so infatuated?

436
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,180
 Have you been influenced by Jiang Muying? Or are you suffering from the after-effects of concussion?

437
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:41,620
You saw Su at the Friendship Hospital last time?

438
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,782
Yes, she was hiding there, working as an interpreter.

439
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:49,967
Friendship Hospital has a special status. We don't dare to make a move.

440
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:54,692
My head's about to explode. Forget about that. It's her fake alcohol that's giving me headaches.

441
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,620
Get the guards together.

442
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,560
Yes, Sir.

443
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:12,440
But, General. Dr. Eliot said all the examination reports show that your brain is perfectly fine. No tumors, no bleeding.

444
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,560
The equipment and medical resources at the French National Hospital have always been the best in Lakaya. There should be no mistakes, right?

445
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,460
Let's hope that the Chinese doctors at the Friendship Hospital aren't so incompetent.

446
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,840
- Good morning, Dr. Gu. 
 - Good morning.

447
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
 I heard you almost got injured. An interpreter saved your life.

448
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,980
 Remember to return the favor, huh? Buy some tonic and take good care of her.

449
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,640
 When you both come back after your term ends, I'll thank her properly.

450
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,260
Okay, Grandpa. I'll try to bring her back with me.

451
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,320
The same three for today?

452
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,960
Yeah, that's right.

453
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,140
Auntie, please prepare an extra breakfast for me today.

454
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,540
Sure, no problem.

455
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,940
And this millet porridge. I'll also have a bowl of millet porridge, too.

456
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,800
Don't you dislike millet porridge?

457
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,160
Pack the millet porridge for me. It's nutritious, right?

458
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,440
- Yes, of course. 
 - Add some side dishes, too.

459
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,540
Okay.

460
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,530
Auntie,

461
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,580
do you sell the fillings and wrappers for wontons?

462
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,800
Those wontons are not from our cafeteria.

463
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,320
From the wrapper to the filling, I didn't spend a cent of public money.

464
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,420
I just made them for myself.

465
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,920
I can tell the filling is delicious. Isn't it?

466
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Look at the amount. It's not even enough for one person.

467
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Auntie.

468
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,020
All right.

469
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,420
How are you feeling today? Any better?

470
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,020
Nutritious breakfast for everyone.

471
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,360
- Come on, let's eat. 
 - Come.

472
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,880
But I haven't ordered yet.

473
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,900
There's no need to buy, it's free.

474
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,880
When did it become free?

475
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,200
One for each neurosurgical patient. Are you a patient?

476
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,880
Breakfast has become free for patients?

477
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,320
It's special for the patient in bed 2, on doctor's orders.

478
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Special?

479
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
Come, Wei'an, eat while it's hot.

480
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,600
Mini wontons?!

481
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,720
I've missed wontons, Auntie. I want to eat some, too.

482
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,880
Only one bowl is available. Dr. Fang, your breakfast is in the cafeteria.

483
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,420
Hold on, my heart hurts so much.

484
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,340
Quickly check me. I want to eat wontons, too.

485
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,600
Eat while it's hot, as the doctor ordered.

486
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,460
- We can still have wontons in Lakaya! 
 - The sun has risen from the west.

487
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,840
Which doctor prescribed these mini wontons?

488
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,760
Boss. Do you know?

489
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,640
I only know that you're idle now. Go and get an extension for the patient in bed 2.

490
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,340
Extend the stay? Why?

491
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,500
I just have a mild concussion. I should be able to be discharged tomorrow, right?

492
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,740
Remain in the hospital for observation to prevent delayed intracranial hemorrhage.

493
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,900
But I've already recovered.

494
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,140
I'm a doctor. And this is my order.

495
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,500

496
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:10,060

497
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:14,950
