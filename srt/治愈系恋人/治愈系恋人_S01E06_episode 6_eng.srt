00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,980

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,180

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,620

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,640
I've been dying to eat this. It's delicious.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,060
Wei'an, why aren't you eating anything? The surgery was successful. General woke up, too.

19
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,940
We're finally safe. We're free. Let's get hyped. Come on.

20
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,020
Cheers.

21
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,636
It's not time to celebrate yet. The biopsy result hasn't been released yet.

22
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:05,140
General said he wasn't afraid of death but dying from an unknown cause.

23
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,240
Besides, Dr. Gu found the General's enemy.

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,940
Come on. Another toast to Dr. Gu.

25
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,740
- Thank you. 
 - To your hard work.

26
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,880
Wait. You guys don't drink beer? Only me?

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,076
The boss said alcohol paralyzes the central nervous system and affects surgical precision.

28
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,880
Wei'an, what about you? You don't perform surgeries.

29
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,360
Even so, she has to consider the potential risk of alcoholic cerebral atrophy.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,380
Here. Have some shrimp to nourish your brain.

31
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,500
You have cerebral atrophy.

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm sure you don't drink because you can't hold your liquor, and you get drunk quickly.

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,860
You can even see that? Cheers, guys.

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,320
- Come on. Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,380
You're not drinking alcohol. Why did you down it?

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,940
I'll drink it up.

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,560
Hello.

38
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,040
Got it.

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,820
The biopsy result is released.

40
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,360
Dr. Gu, our team won a good fight.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,160
Thank you.

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:39,920
General, the surgery was successful. But we didn't actually win.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,320
According to the biopsy result, the tumor is highly malignant.

44
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,377
Though the entire lesion was removed,

45
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,820
the relapse rate is still very high.

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,800
How much longer can I live?

47
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,680
It depends on the growth of the tumor.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,240
Maybe... Half a year. No more than two years.

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,040
No one can be victorious forever.

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,240
Thank you for letting me know what I have to fight.

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,360
Su, are you being sad? Are you worried that you can't make money from selling me drinks?

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,060
Young Grandet, I'll make you earn enough before I die.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,060
Next month, come to my house for the New Year Party. No one is leaving sober.

54
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,240
We will drink a lot of alcohol. You can make a fortune.

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,160
Jiang Jiang, are you ready?

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,620
- In a minute. 
 - Hurry up. We can't be late. Or the General would be angry.

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,740
All right.

58
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, I found it.

59
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,760
What's this?

60
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
My lucky rose crystal.

61
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,100
Wei'an, I observed the sky and had a divination.

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,160
Tonight, stars are up in the sky, and they all indicate love.

63
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,600
Full scores for love. And tonight, I will meet my Mr. Right.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,100
Even thinking of it thrills me.

65
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,480
What does it have to do with your crystal?

66
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,680
It has to do with my crystal because it gives me good luck of love.

67
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,620
Jiang Jiang, come on. Everything in your eyes can be ceremonial.

68
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,440
I heard about a custom in Lakaya.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,080
When the New Year's bell rings, and you kiss the one beside you, you'll have good luck throughout the year.

70
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
What custom? You must have read too many romantic novels.

71
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,340
You have to believe it. When in Lakaya, do as local people do.

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,760
Even if it's Dr. Gu who stands beside me tonight, I will kiss him. Don't regret it, then.

73
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,260
I won't regret it. I have no time for love.

74
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,260
All right. Go get your hair done now. Hurry. Go.

75
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,820
Be quick.

76
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,160
Wei'an.

77
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
You look gorgeous tonight.

78
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,140
Hurry. The dress suffocates me.

79
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,340
- What? 
 - You're way too handsome.

80
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,100
I have to stand far away from you. Or pretty girls wouldn't notice me.

81
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,420
Why haven't they come yet? It's been a while.

82
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,720
Limo and beauties... It's worth all the waiting.

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,360
Beauties, get in the car, please.

84
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,580
I want to sit in the back.

85
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,175
Fang Mingfan, you drive.

86
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,995
Interpreter Jiang, you take the front seat.

87
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,760
Why are you staring like this? Do I look weird?

88
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,660
You...

89
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:41,697
Aren't you cold?

90
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,140
A handsome face but a harsh mouth.

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,700
Su, you look even prettier than the moon.

92
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:08,360
I wonder if you'd give me the honor to be your dance partner.

93
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,700
Su, I called my mentor on my way here.

94
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,580
Do you want to know what she said?

95
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,680
Really?

96
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,820
When did the serious man become a flamboyant peacock？

97
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,580
Let's talk in the car.

98
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,400
You can't let him take Interpreter Su.

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,820
Wei'an...

100
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,560
She didn't even take me. I've never taken a sports car.

101
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Interpreter Jiang, you have to take my front seat and navigate.

102
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,080
The experiment to cure Huntington's Disease with cell transplantation failed,

103
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,684
but Dr. Marta never gave up.

104
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:38,180
Actually, this experiment has secretly restarted recently.

105
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,000
Really?

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
Has she solved the key problem of increasing the survival rate?

107
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,620
Which cells are used for the experiment, autologous or nurtured?

108
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,940
Is it in a clinical trial? Has she started to recruit volunteers?

109
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,520
Easy, easy. My head is going to explode from all the questions.

110
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Su, I guessed you would be interested.

111
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,120
But to my surprise, you know so much about the experimental details of such a rare disease.

112
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,340
Su, when talking seriously about medicine, you're charming.

113
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,200
I adore you more.

114
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,260
Adore? Please don't kid.

115
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,720
I'm not kidding. You're gorgeous, but you don't know that.

116
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,540
In the crowd, people always spot you at first sight and keep looking at you.

117
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,940
Look. That guy is looking at you.

118
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,680
So are those guys.

119
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,100
And him.

120
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,600
Actually, I don't mind when a princess has some knights.

121
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm not a princess,

122
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,320
and I don't need knights.

123
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,260
Boss, why are you still drinking alone?

124
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,400
If you continue, Interpreter Su will be stolen away by that peacock.

125
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,960
- Sorry. 
 - Never mind. It's okay.

126
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,440
 Gu Yunzheng, what's wrong with you?

127
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,840
 Attention, guests. Then, the New Year countdown starts in ten minutes.

128
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,570
 When the New Year's bell strikes, let's hug and kiss under the giant fireworks.

129
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,920
It can't be wrong. The stars are never wrong. On the New Year's Eve, I will meet my Mr. Right.

130
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,100
But the New Year's Eve is almost over. Why isn't he showing up?

131
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,260
Jiang Jiang. There you are. I've been looking for you.

132
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180

133
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,560
Why? Why is it you?

134
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,900
What? Are you disappointed to see me?

135
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,500
Oh, God. It can't be true.

136
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,780
May I have another one? I'm begging you.

137
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Another one? What?

138
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,520
Another man.

139
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,420
What are you doing here? What do you want?

140
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,000
The wind is rising. I don't want you to catch a cold.

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't do this. I won't like you.

142
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,240
I insist on liking you, okay? Put it on.

143
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,920
You're annoying, Fang Mingfan.

144
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,480
How did I annoy you?

145
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,420
Look. According to the horoscope, I can meet my Mr. Right today.

146
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,600
Mr. Right?

147
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Do you mean me?

148
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,860
No. I don't want it to be you.

149
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,800
Look. In a few minutes, the New Year's bell will strike.

150
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,600
No one but me will be it.

151
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,400
So, accept your fate.

152
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,080
What are you doing?

153
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Su, too much stress will break you down. You should be self-indulgent sometimes.

154
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,160
Otherwise, we'd be bored during the long years.

155
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,960
Not everyone has long years to live.

156
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,800
Life is short. Some people don't want to waste even a second.

157
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,960
Then, we should cherish our time and enjoy the moment.

158
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,580
On New Year's Eve, we ring out the old and ring in the new. Death is farewell as well as rebirth.

159
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:49,560
Everyone, thank you for coming to my funeral party on this special evening.

160
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,526
I've been living a military life. A bazooka once broke my leg.

161
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:06,460
But I luckily survived. To live means to win.

162
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,549
In the last campaign, I met the deadliest enemy.

163
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:18,180
Dr. Gu Yunzheng of Friendship Hospital helped me find this enemy.

164
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,500
But this time, I'm not lucky enough.

165
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,760
A malignant tumor will soon spread all over my brain.

166
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,128
I really want to shoot it now. But I can't die like this.

167
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,000
I like the Chinese saying, "Enjoy life while it is favorable."

168
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,280
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of not living life to its fullest.

169
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,420
Tomorrow, I'll continue to fight and hunt, like how I took my gun on the first day.

170
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,451
I've done great things, and I have no regrets. My life is worth it.

171
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:10,276
This is the funeral I want. No tears. Joy only.

172
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,640
 Do great things and have no regrets. Life is worth it.

173
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,345
We have a custom in Lakaya.

174
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:31,140
When the New Year's bell strikes, kissing the one beside you
will give you good luck of the year.

175
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,379
Let's hug tightly and kiss passionately.

176
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
♫  Your secret  ♫

177
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,420
♫  Luckily, I was there to hear you sleep talk  ♫

178
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,360
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

179
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,860
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

180
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,560
♫  My secret  ♫

181
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,360
♫  I've forgotten I was lonely once  ♫

182
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,560
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

183
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,480
Didn't you say you disliked me?

184
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,960
I... I just borrowed you for a bit. Didn't you see Eliot wanted to kiss me?

185
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,660
Did you force a kiss on me just to avoid Eliot?

186
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,320
But why? Don't you always think Eliot is way too handsome?

187
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,280
What forced kiss? Why do you have so many questions? You didn't want that?

188
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,920
You said you didn't like me. But your body is quite honest.

189
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,860
Jiang Muying, you must be responsible for me.

190
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,520
♫  Your secret  ♫

191
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,525
♫  Luckily, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

192
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,530
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

193
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,520
♫  It's continuous bliss lingering on and on  ♫

194
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,665
♫  My secret  ♫

195
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:46,340
♫  I've forgotten I was lonely once  ♫

196
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:54,780
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

197
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:33,905
 Su Wei'an, what are you thinking? Are you even qualified for love?

198
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,945
 Why did I kiss him? That idiot was so lucky.

199
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,390

200
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,630
 You have a stomach problem.

201
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:56,550
Even if the company has a shortage of funds and you want investment, you shouldn't have drunk that much.

202
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,850
Have some water.

203
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,500
Thanks.

204
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,940
If Director Xu can really invest some money,

205
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,760
the financial pressure of HDQ39 research will be smaller.

206
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,620
I'll keep contacting my father. Don't worry too much.

207
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,740
But I no longer want to see you try so desperately.

208
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,000
Xiao Ran, thank you for sharing my burden.

209
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:58,400
Tonight, shall I go to your place? You're drunk. I want to take care of you.

210
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,140
No need. I...

211
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,020
I have plans.

212
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,640
 - Su Wei'an really dropped out?
- Yes, she did. Last term,

213
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,600
 she made a big scene for the authorship with her best friend. She even reported her mentor.

214
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,980
 But she didn't need to drop out for the authorship.

215
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,980
 I heard Wen Ran's father was a director of Neurology at Zhanghe Hospital.

216
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,620
 Su Wei'an reported Wen Ran and He Xiaoguang. So, she offended both Zhanghe Hospital and Huaren Hospital.

217
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,100
 - Hello, Senior Brother. 
 - Hello, Senior Brother.

218
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,180
 He is Director Du's son, a senior at Neurosurgery.

219
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,020
 I remember he's close to Su Wei'an. Before, I often see them in the lab.

220
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,460

221
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,220

222
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,280
 Huntington's Disease?

223
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,440
 Su Wei'an dropped out. Why did she Google Huntington's Disease?

224
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,100
 Yuncheng, I had my friends ask around in medical schools in Paris. There isn't a student named Su Wei'an.

225
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,100
 Her mother said she was studying in Paris. Can you please ask around more?

226
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,660
 Is it possible that she's in some third-rate college?

227
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,580
 No way. She's a top student. She must be in a top-tier medical school.

228
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,880
 Fine. I'll try harder, then.

229
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,600

230
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,680

231
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:03,040

232
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,660
 Hello, Professor Wen. I'm Du Yuncheng from Jiehui Medicines Company.

233
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,100
 You guys go. I'll catch up.

234
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,400
 You're the son of Du Yongsong, Director of Huaren Hospital, right?

235
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,100
 - You know me? 
 - I've heard my daughter mention you.

236
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,460
  She said you were her senior. Well, what do you want me for?

237
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,180
 Professor Wen, on behalf of Jiehui Medicines Company,

238
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,960
 I want to talk about restarting the research of HDQ39, a new medicine for Huntington's Disease.

239
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,960
 Are you sure you want to invest in the HDQ39 project?

240
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,560
 You have to know Huntington's Disease is a very rare disease in the world.

241
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,460
 The incidence is no more than three out of one hundred thousand.

242
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,120
 - The number of Chinese patients is less than 30,000. 
 - Why would you invest in this rare disease project?

243
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,640
 This medication means a lot to me. I have a reason why this research must be done.

244
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:06,880
 Wei'an, if HDQ39 succeeds and chorea patients may have a cure,

245
00:25:07,525 --> 00:25:10,165
 can you then come back?

246
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,900

247
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,460
Your child has a ruptured arachnoid membrane.

248
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,200
- What? What did you say? 
 - Ruptured arachnoid membrane.

249
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,820
- Rupture of arachnoid membrane. 
 - Tumor on the head?

250
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,180
- You... You don't need to worry. 
 - Tumor on the head?

251
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,780
- I don't need to worry? What is this? 
 - Here.

252
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,600
- I don't understand. 
 - I understand.

253
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,200
- You don't. No. I still don't get it. 
 - I know.

254
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,320
Madam, you...

255
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,680
Afternoon... Come. Interpreters will come. All right?

256
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,980
All right, okay.

257
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,560
Fang Mingfan. Where are the interpreters?

258
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,800
Where's Su Wei'an? Why isn't she here?

259
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,440
You have to ask yourself. Boss, what did you do last night?

260
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,720
Last night?

261
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,040
Go get Su Wei'an here. Get her to outpatient service.

262
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,820
But it's not her shift today.

263
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,259
Last night, you force-kissed her.

264
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,859
Can't she avoid you for days?

265
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,980
Then go get Jiang Muying here.

266
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,640
You'd better call her. If I do, she won't answer.

267
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,860
What happened to you?

268
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,220
Last night, she force-kissed me. She can avoid me for days.

269
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,220
Last night, she force-kissed me. She can avoid me for days.

270
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,380
What are you thinking?

271
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,060
Boss, someone forced a kiss on me. Don't you care about me?

272
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,652
Then let me care about you.

273
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:26,397
Last night, what suddenly came to you and made you kiss Interpreter Su?

274
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,515
Do you want to pursue her?

275
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,555
Did you do your rounds?

276
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,400
Hey, Su.

277
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,660
Good morning, chouchou.

278
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,760
This French guy is really romantic. He came to Miss Su so soon.

279
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,537
Did he just say Uncle? Who's he calling Uncle? 
  (T/N: chouchou sounds like Uncle in Chinese)

280
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:13,937
In French, chouchou means sweetheart.

281
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,720
You're my sweetheart, too.

282
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,660
This is life. I'll tell you everything you want to know.

283
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,960
You mentioned that the research has made progress. Has your mentor passed the animal experiments for chorea medicine?

284
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,220
Today, my mentor emailed me some data from Henri Mondor Lab.

285
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,680
I printed a copy for you.

286
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,480
Thanks.

287
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,760

288
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Some doctors reported this gentleman had violated regulations to occupy this area and brought unchecked food.

289
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,360
He seriously affects the work and sanitation here. Interpreter Su, please ask him to leave.

290
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,480
Report? But we're outdoors.

291
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,120
We usually have coffee or sandwiches out here. Who reported him?

292
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,120
Why don't we go somewhere else?

293
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,420
An, I'll go back to Paris next month. Do you want to go to the Henri Mondor Lab?

294
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,180
You mean you will take me to visit Dr. Marta?

295
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,820
Not just to pay a visit, I mean, do you want to work at the Henri Mondor Lab?

296
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,900
Really?

297
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,980
You can work for Dr. Marta. Would you like to come to Paris with me?

298
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Will I be able to help in the research for curing chorea?

299
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,520
But... I only have an undergraduate degree from a medical university in China.

300
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,185
- Am I eligible? 
 - I've been doing some research.

301
00:29:55,185 --> 00:29:57,760
France accepts the undergraduate degree from Huaren Medical University.

302
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,440
Our lab once had a research assistant with an undergraduate degree.

303
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,400
That's great. That's great.

304
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,680
But you have to be well-prepared.

305
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,580
Chorea is very rare, and it will take much time to develop new medicines for it.

306
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,860
You might have to be in Paris for years.

307
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,540
No problem.

308
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,120
As long as I can cure chorea.

309
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,040
Su Wei'an.

310
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,200
Come here.

311
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,360
How could you go on a date during work hours?

312
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,660
Haven't I told you the consequence of absence without leave?

313
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,000
It's my day off.

314
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,470
Jiang Jiang is on duty. And Jiang Jiang can handle it all on her own now.

315
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,320
Well, she's not bad. Except for interpreting intracranial aneurysm into skull base tumors

316
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,920
and cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) into cerebral artery adhesion, she's doing well.

317
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,360
At least, she's more reliable than someone who dates during work hours.

318
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,480
Who are you mocking? Who dates during work hours?

319
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,520
Su Wei'an, the French are usually pursuing romance and freshness.

320
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,700
They're always ready to say sweet words. You can't take it seriously.

321
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,980
I just want to warn you:

322
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't rush into love affairs blindly, or you may get disappointed and affect your work.

323
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,580
Don't worry, Professor Gu.

324
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm just a temporary interpreter and won't create any bad influence on the medical team.

325
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
I didn't mean it that way.

326
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,460
That's what I meant.

327
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,600
And it won't happen again.

328
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
I want to resign.

329
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,060
Resign?

330
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,480
Su Wei'an, it's just a slight criticism. You don't have to resign out of ill temper.

331
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm not showing an ill temper. I've been thinking about it.

332
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,780
Is it because of that kiss?

333
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
I...

334
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,080
Don't take it too seriously. That kiss was just part of the local New Year custom.

335
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,259
Don't take it too seriously. That kiss was just part of the local New Year custom.

336
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,659
And at the time, you were right next to me.

337
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,900
Don't take it seriously.

338
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,320
You don't need to explain it to me. It was just a kiss.

339
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,320
I certainly won't take it seriously.

340
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,180
Then, why do you have to quit your job?

341
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,620
Because of money.

342
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,660
I found a more profitable job.

343
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,560
I'm leaving for Paris.

344
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,560
So...

345
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,400
don't get in my way of making money.

346
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,040
♫  It's okay if you forget  ♫

347
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,800
♫  You were the one to give me courage  ♫

348
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,140
♫  I will always bless you for the scenery that I will never be able to wait for  ♫

349
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,730
♫  Even if you forget, it doesn't matter  ♫

350
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,600
♫  It's my way of saving myself  ♫

351
00:33:51,600 --> 00:34:00,560
♫  I will always love you and never given up  ♫

352
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,220
 You're going to France? Why so suddenly?

353
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,340
I've got a big business chance recently, so I have to go to Paris.

354
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,660
It's okay. Take me with you wherever you go, will you?

355
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,740
Jiang Jiang, staying with me will only bring you hardships. And you're not short of money, anyway.

356
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Do me a favor and go home early.

357
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,580
No. I've come all this way to find you. You can't just leave me behind again.

358
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,620
Never ever.

359
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,000
And I've never been to Paris. Why not just take me with you?

360
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,880
Are you going to leave without me again?

361
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,860
I'm telling you, that's impossible.

362
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,560
I didn't realize it three years ago, but I won't let you go without me this time.

363
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,000
Otherwise, tell me, why are you leaving, where and how long are you going?

364
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,160
And why did you suddenly quit school?

365
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,620
Why did you give up your dream to be a doctor? Explain all this to me.

366
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,660
I...

367
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,060
- I'm going to elope with Eliot. 
 - Elope?

368
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,500
Yes. So, you can't come with me, Jiang Jiang.

369
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,260
You're going to elope with Eliot?

370
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,980
Su Wei'an, you like Gu Yunzheng. You can hide it from others, but you can't hide it from me.

371
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:30,480
Haven't you been into him since our schooldays? And you kissed each other at the New Year party.

372
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,740
Now you're telling me you're going to elope with a Frenchman you've only met a few times?

373
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,380
Su Wei'an, I'm not stupid.

374
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:45,300
Jiang Jiang, that kiss between me and Gu Yunzheng was just part of the New Year custom.

375
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,280
It didn't have any special meaning. But I fell in love with Eliot at first sight.

376
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,980
He's my Mr. Right. I'm going to France with him.

377
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,000
And you know, love is unfair.

378
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,980
It doesn't care who came first.

379
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,460
What are you doing?

380
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,420
This. Explain to me what this is.

381
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,620
Why are you learning about euthanasia?

382
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,400
It's a favor someone asked me to do. And he promised to give me a high reward.

383
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,100
It's really a high reward, so I kept it till now.

384
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm not going to seek death, okay? My life is good.

385
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,740
Su Wei'an,

386
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,260
there's not a word of truth out of your mouth. Do you even consider me a friend?

387
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,280
Yes, I do.

388
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,080
Wei'an, no matter what happened to you, no matter what your secret sorrow is,

389
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,300
you can always share it with me. I know you can't share everything with your mom,

390
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,920
but you can share it with me. I'll definitely keep your secret. Really.

391
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,200
You know, I've been in Lakaya for so long, but I've never told Sister Lan anything about you. I'm very reliable.

392
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,080
And we're such close friends, just like family members. I can share your burden.

393
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,820
But Jiang Jiang, I... I really didn't lie to you.

394
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:33,280
I'm going to elope with Eliot. Really.

395
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,780
Besides, didn't you want me to date? That rose crystal in my bag is from you, right?

396
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,260
Trust me, Jiang Jiang.

397
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,840
Are you determined to hide the truth from me even though you're leaving for France?

398
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,600
Okay. If you dare to leave this time, our relationship is over. I don't have a friend like you.

399
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,380
Jiang Jiang.

400
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,580
 I want to resign.

401
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,420
 Resign?

402
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,920
 Is it because of that kiss? Don't take it too seriously.

403
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,220
 That kiss was just part of the local New Year custom.

404
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,880
 And at the time, you were right next to me.

405
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,110
 Don't take it seriously.

406
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,160
 You don't need to explain it to me. It was just a kiss.

407
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,760
 French people regard a kiss as normal as eating and drinking.

408
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,980
 I certainly won't take it seriously.

409
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:16,415
 Gu Yunzheng. You're a nice person, but how could you say those words?

410
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:26,280

411
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,380
Su Wei'an, have you had breakfast?

412
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,420
No, that's too stiff.

413
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
Su Wei'an, here are small sweet rice balls from the dining hall.

414
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
Su Wei'an, here are small sweet rice balls from the dining hall.

415
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,460
They're sweet and sticky. I bought them for you.

416
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,540
Yesterday, I didn't mean it.

417
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,740
In fact, I...

418
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,880
No, I'm being too wordy.

419
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,260
Su Wei'an, let's have breakfast together.

420
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,360
Dr. Gu has excellent medical skills. You can totally trust him.

421
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,600
At Huaren Hospital in China, he's the youngest associate chief physician.

422
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,137
Although he looks quite serious and seems aloof, he takes every patient to his heart.

423
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:55,321
So, don't worry, the operation will go well.

424
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,060
Well, Su Wei'an.

425
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,560
You're so aggressive in front of me, but you praise me behind my back.

426
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,200
That's how you are.

427
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,160
Su Wei'an.

428
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,120
Dr. Gu. I was on my way to see you.

429
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,060
This...

430
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,840
This is my resignation letter.

431
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,440
Although it's just a temporary job, I think it's better to treat it formally.

432
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,540
Thanks for taking care of me all this time.

433
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,280
I hope you find a qualified interpreter as soon as possible.

434
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,800
Su Wei'an,

435
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,960
you speak good French, and you have a medical background.

436
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,660
To find an interpreter like you in a short time isn't an easy task.

437
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:57,280
If... you just want to make more money,

438
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,880
you don't have to go to France, and I can give you a raise.

439
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,540
I don't need that. It's not all about money.

440
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,620
Then, give me a reason that can satisfy me.

441
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,700
Why are you giving up once again? Explain it to me.

442
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,550
If it's not about money, then is it about a person?

443
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,010
You haven't fallen for Eliot, right?

444
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,050
Are you leaving for him?

445
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,060
I'll be off if there's nothing else. I have to visit the embassy to get an expedited visa.

446
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,980
According to our contract, you need to apply for resignation one week in advance,

447
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,820
and you can't leave until one week after the date of application.

448
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,060
During this period,

449
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,740
be on your duty as usual. Absence from duty will lead to a deduction of salary.

450
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:10,030

451
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:15,000
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

461
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,360
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

462
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,300
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

463
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:15,880
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

464
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,680
♫  The night guides the hands of time  ♫

465
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,360
♫  The hustle and bustle gradually drowns out the silence  ♫

466
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,440
♫  In the grand theater of life, we play out the scene of our encounter  ♫

467
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,460
♫  A rainbow brings a touch of magic to the darkness  ♫

468
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,120
♫  And the wind that crossed the desert  ♫

469
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:55,280
♫  They were once our witnesses  ♫

470
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,540
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

471
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:09,700
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

472
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,720
♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

473
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,780
♫  I'm like your glass of wine, always here to warm your lonesome soul  ♫

474
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:20,880
♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

475
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:30,000
♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫
