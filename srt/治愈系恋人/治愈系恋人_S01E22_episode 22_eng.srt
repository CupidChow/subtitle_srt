00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,280

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,680

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,320
Slow down.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
Mom.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,460
Avoid crowded areas for now, and stop going to square dancing too.

19
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,480
Wash your hands immediately when you get home. Always wear a mask when you go out.

20
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,560
Call me if anything happens.

21
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,260
Okay.

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm heading out.

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,740
Look after yourself on your trip.

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,700
I'll be waiting for you at home.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,460
- Don't worry. 
 - Off you go.

26
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,360
Be careful.

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,670

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,240

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,320
Hello. Xiao Du.

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,660
Hello, Senior Brother.

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,960
 Sister Lan just gave me a call.

32
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,480
Are you keeping something from her?

33
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
No, I'm not.

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
You can be honest with me.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,560
 Then I can help you keep it.

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,040
Huaren Hospital had an outbreak of pneumonic plague. Have you heard that?

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
 I'm planning to help out at the hospital.

38
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,600
 But I can't let my mom know it. She'd be too worried.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,240
I get it. Now I know how to respond to her.

40
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Auntie, I got in touch with Wei'an.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,460
She's really on a business trip.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,300
The first confirmed case: Male, 60 years old, a Jinhai native.

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,900
He traveled in the northwest last week.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,040
He suddenly experienced a high fever two days ago.

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,480
He was initially treated at a village clinic ineffectively and then transferred to us.

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,105
A 48-hour bacterial culture yielded a positive for Yersinia pestis.

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Gene sequencing also confirmed the presence of Yersinia pestis DNA.

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,920
From 12 o'clock today, our hospital has been under emergency lockdown.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,600
We're currently tracking all close contacts, who will be quarantined immediately.

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,200
Meanwhile, everyone in the quarantine area is undergoing an epidemiological survey and analysis.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,760
Follow any directive from the Municipal CDC.

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,640
And inform your higher-ups immediately in an emergency. Additionally, ensure our frontline medical staff are well-protected.

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,260
If necessary, be ready to lock down the hospital.

54
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,040
Also, guarantee the supplies to the quarantine area. Try to soothe the concerns of patients and their families.

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Do you work here? The building is under lockdown.

56
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,660
Brother, I'm a practicing doctor at the Neurosurgery Dept. of Huaren Hospital.

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm also a doctor.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,700
Your ID is only temporary. You're not a permanent staff here.

59
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
- Oh... 
 - What did I say?

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,320
- You're not allowed to enter either. 
 - But why can't I go in?

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
The building is locked down.

62
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Without an emergency or specific authorization from the director, no one can come in or out.

63
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,060
But...

64
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,820
Listen, Su Wei'an, Don't trespass, or there will be legal consequences.

65
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm not foolish.

66
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,420
I may have dropped out of school, but I know the Infectious Disease Law well.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
But I know you too well. For my boss's sake, you can risk anything.

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,620
Remember what you did for him before? Breaking through the cordon is nothing for you.

69
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,420
I just want to get inside to be of some use.

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,420
The plague is really dangerous. What if...

71
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,240
No "what if." Don't talk nonsense.

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,660
What?

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,900
Though, why was he quarantined in respiratory?

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,180
No way, the building's locked down. Not even I can get him out.

75
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,080
Stop causing trouble. We could face legal consequences.

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,180
Just wait there. The Epidemic Control Office will handle it.

77
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,980
- What's going on, dad? 
 - There's been a plague case in respiratory.

78
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,760
Your brother is quarantined there.

79
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,680
How did that happen? He works in neurosurgery. Why was he in respiratory?

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,920
He attended a consultation there this morning and got caught in the emergency lockdown.

81
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,720
Dad, for treating the plague, we need streptomycin for intramuscular injection,

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,300
and preventative medications for susceptible patients.

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,540
If the hospital is in a shortage, Jiehui can allocate supplies from across the province.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,900
Mr. Zhang's tumor has shown extensive, sieve-like growth.

85
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,280
The solid portion clings to the base of the sphenoid orbit in the front-middle cranial fossa,

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,320
spreading to the intraorbital and periorbital spaces

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,820
and infiltrating the cavernous sinus and the side of the sellar region.

88
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,160
Preliminary assessment suggests it's a large adenoid cystic carcinoma.

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,460
In this case, a clinicopathologic analysis is urgent via nasal endoscopic surgery to confirm the diagnosis.

90
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,920
When can we receive the surgery?

91
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,880
The tumor's main trait is the erosion of the skull base and intracranial invasion.

92
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,760
Don't worry, I'll arrange the surgery soon. Things will get better.

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,800
Doctor, please save his life.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,500
Physical contact is not allowed in this special period. Thanks for your cooperation.

95
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,660
Don't worry. I'll surely do my best.

96
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,220
Thank you, Doctor.

97
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,320
Dr. Gu, have you eaten yet?

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,420
No rush.

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,660
Is your call still not answered?

100
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,400
With you away, your department must be super busy.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,340
Feel free to use my phone if it's urgent.

102
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,860
Nothing urgent.

103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,500
This morning, a doctor from my dept led his first surgery.

104
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
I wonder how it went.

105
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,460
You seem to care about him so much. He must be talented.

106
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,160
Dr. Gu, Dr. Fang from Neurosurgery Department rang for you earlier today.

107
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
But you were elsewhere.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,010
Yeah, it's him.

109
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,950
- Did his surgery go smoothly? 
 - I don't know.

110
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,180
But judging from his mood, I think everything went well.

111
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,700
That's great.

112
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,760
You're so concerned about your colleague,

113
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,480
but what about your girlfriend?

114
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,140
I have things to do.

115
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:08,270

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,320
 If I hadn't played such tricks,

117
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 Su Wei'an, you wouldn't face your true feelings at all.

118
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,020
 I know what my true feelings are. You don't need to remind me.

119
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,020
Hello, do you know Dr. Gu Yunzheng?

120
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,520
Sorry, I don't.

121
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,380
Hello, do you know Dr. Gu from neurosurgery?

122
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,540
Sorry, I don't.

123
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,740
Miss, you should go home. You've been here all day.

124
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,140
I'll just wait here. I'm not getting in your way.

125
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,060
What's Dr. Gu's relationship to you?

126
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,550
Wei'an?

127
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,260
Senior Brother. What are you doing here?

128
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,440
Just personal matters. Why are you here?

129
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,040
I want to help in the quarantine area, but they're not letting me in.

130
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,140
Are you looking for Gu Yunzheng here? I heard he's quarantined here.

131
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,080
Have you heard from him?

132
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,300
He should be fine. I just left the director's office,

133
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,060
and I didn't hear any news about medical staff getting infected.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
That's great.

135
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,940
Are you worried about him?

136
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,520
No.

137
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,920
It's about my final payment. He still owes me a final payment.

138
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,640
How about having a meal together? I guess you haven't had dinner. Watch out for low blood sugar.

139
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,520
Thanks, but I have no appetite.

140
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,100
You need to eat to have the strength to collect your final payment.

141
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,920
Don't worry. If anything goes down in the hospital, I'll be informed right away.

142
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,420
All right, stop worrying. Let's go.

143
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,440
Sorry, we're closing up.

144
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,100
Why don't we just eat noodles next door?

145
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,840
What about the lots of burgers here? Won't you sell them?
Or are they only for delivery?

146
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,800
One of Huaren Hospital's buildings is under lockdown.

147
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,200
The doctors, nurses, patients and their families haven't eaten. These are saved for them.

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
They will be delivered later.

149
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,560
Can takeout be delivered inside?

150
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,620
Yes.

151
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,440
They aim to control the spread of infections from the hospital.

152
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,280
We have agreed with the hospital to leave the burgers at the gate.

153
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,080
And their staff will bring them inside to distribute across the departments.

154
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,780
Excuse me, do you mind if I write a message on the packages?

155
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,440

156
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,720
 Su Yuan is causing a scene again.

157
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,020

158
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,880
How much does Gu Yunzheng owe you that you're collecting it with burgers during lockdown?

159
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,620
A large amount. If he doesn't pay soon, his debt will never be cleared.

160
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,100
You shouldn't owe a girl's money these days.

161
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,620
What about I write it with you? That way, it'll go faster.

162
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,640
No need. He only recognizes my handwriting.

163
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,940
Then, let me drive you there later. We can load more this way and go faster too.

164
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,320
Thank you, Senior Brother.

165
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,580
Delivering takeout with a Benz!

166
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,800
Whoever you're looking for is lucky!

167
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Quickly, over there.

168
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,680
Pack up the takeout.

169
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,185
You are delivering the burgers? We really appreciate it.

170
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:27,160
Hello. Do you know Dr. Gu Yunzheng?

171
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,960
Gu Yunzheng?

172
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,240
Which department? What floor?

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,060
- Should I find him for you? 
 - No need, thank you.

174
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,760
Thank you, too.

175
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,180
Wei'an, I'll take you home.

176
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,320
Did you forget that I'm on a business trip?

177
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,780
Right, how'd I forget that? I'll find you a place to stay.

178
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,180
No need, I'll stay at Jiang Jiang's tonight.

179
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,740
You go back first, Senior Brother.

180
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,060
Okay. Send me a message when you get to Jiang Jiang's.

181
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,100
Stay safe.

182
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,420
Get lost! Don't touch me!

183
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,600
- Get away! 
 - President Du. Shall we give her a sedative?

184
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,140
Auntie! Calm down. Go get iodophor and gauze.

185
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
You all go out now.

186
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,040
Auntie, just bear with it. I'll deal with it.

187
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,580
I can't even feel the pain.

188
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,440
Auntie. If the caregivers or nurses did wrong, directly tell me.

189
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,000
If you need extra staff, I'll arrange it.

190
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,680
I want to keep taking the medicine.

191
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,800
What medicine?

192
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,940
You know what I'm talking about.

193
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,860
Today,

194
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,680
I suddenly couldn't control myself.

195
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,680
I was getting better recently.

196
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,580
Auntie,

197
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,100
I've invested in HDQ39 for three years, and I know the effects best.

198
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,180
Your aneurysm isn't related to the medicine.

199
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,920
But whatever the case, your current condition isn't suitable for continued medication.

200
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,000
You need to quit the drug trial.

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,900
The drug works well for me.

202
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,720
Xiao Du,

203
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,140
please talk to Professor Wen for me. I want to keep testing the drug.

204
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,660
But that's against the rules. I can't do that.

205
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,400
Plus, you've had an adverse event.

206
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,680
Procedure-wise, we need to report to the ethics committee.

207
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,640
If you don't quit, someone will come for a follow-up soon.

208
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,440
You might be forced to stop the meds then.

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,400
Xiao Du, I'm begging you. I want to keep testing the drug.

210
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,440
You must have a way, right?

211
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,040
Auntie,

212
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,940
I'll find a way to get the meds for you.

213
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,800
But...

214
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,880
this signature is signed by you,

215
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,960
right?

216
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,760
Yes, I signed it.

217
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,820
I signed it.

218
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,700
Auntie, only we two need to know about this.

219
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,050
You cannot tell anyone else.

220
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,590
I won't tell.

221
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I won't tell.

222
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,440
- This is for you guys. 
 - Thank you.

223
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,880
- This is for you. 
 - Thanks a lot.

224
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,940
Make sure to keep the wound disinfected.

225
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,500
Doctor, this is for you.

226
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,800
I don't need it, thanks.

227
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
So strange, a girl was looking for Dr. Gu at the door today.

228
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,400
She kept asking anyone coming into the building about him. I can't remember what dept he is in.

229
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,880
We've got no Dr. Gu in our dept.

230
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
Mommy, who's Dr. Gu?

231
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Isn't Dr. Gu him?

232
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,920
Dr. Gu, someone wants you to call back.

233
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,320

234
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,600
That's Wei'an's handwriting.

235
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,360
Where's the girl you mentioned?

236
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,260
Over there. At the gate with the caution tape.

237
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,520
Here. May I borrow your phone?

238
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,500
Thank you.

239
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,280
Hello, who is this?

240
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,300
 Wei'an, it's me.

241
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,080
Gu Yunzheng!

242
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,620
Where are you?

243
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,640
 Look up.

244
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,700
Wei'an,

245
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,260
I was at a consultation in respiratory today and left my phone in the office.

246
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,560
 I didn't even know you were looking for me.

247
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,080
Wei'an, are you crying?

248
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
No way.

249
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
 Sorry, Wei'an.

250
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,740
 Sorry to worry you.

251
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,540
 But...

252
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,100
knowing you're worried about me really warms me.

253
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,700
Who says I'm worried about you? I'm worried about my final payment.

254
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,060
Since you're okay, I'm heading back.

255
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,860
Wei'an,

256
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,060
don't hang up.

257
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,900
 I want to hear your voice more.

258
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,580
Aren't you busy in there?

259
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,360
Busy, super busy.

260
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,020
 Over here, all departments are short-handed.

261
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,870
 Wherever help's needed, I rush to assist.

262
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,840
I want to hear your voice to give me energy.

263
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
 It gives me the strength to fight.

264
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:41,200
Make sure to wear your mask, eat well, and rest well.

265
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,140
 Things will get better.

266
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,840
All right, you too.

267
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,340
Take good precautions.

268
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,940
What's the matter?

269
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,775
 Hello? Gu Yunzheng?

270
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:08,800
Relax. Relax. Breathe, breathe!

271
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,500
Relax!

272
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,220
This isn't good. His airway's too blocked.

273
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,280
Suction for the patient, quickly!

274
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,760
Hurry, take Dr. Gu for a PCR nucleic acid test and bacterial culture now.

275
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,700
Brother, please let me in.

276
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Young lady, can you speak a foreign language?

277
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,100
We've just been notified by the hospital that the international dept is seeking interpreter volunteers.

278
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,980
Approval from the director is needed.

279
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,740
Director?

280
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,420
Director...

281
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,340

282
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,380
This afternoon, we've conducted PCR tests for all staff,

283
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:26,280
and we've completed intensively the first epidemiological survey.

284
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,080
The confirmed cases and close contacts list have just been delivered to me.

285
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,300
I'll announce it now.

286
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,880
There are three confirmed cases and nine close contacts.

287
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,160

288
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,160
There is a frontline medical worker

289
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,640
on the list.

290
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,140
He's Dr. Gu Yunzheng from Neurosurgery Department.

291
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,480
- Hello? 
 -  Hello, Senior Brother.

292
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,580
 Could you recommend me to your dad? I can speak French and English,

293
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,060
and I have medical knowledge.

294
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,780
 I apply to be an interpreter volunteer in the international dept
of the quarantine area.

295
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,180
Wei'an, listen to me. Gu Yunzheng is a close contact.

296
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,700
What?

297
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,000
 He must be closely quarantined by now.

298
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,140
You wouldn't find him even if you go in.

299
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,180
 Pneumonic plague's mortality

300
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,780
is as high as 70%.

301
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,200
Even so, do you still want to go?

302
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:53,373
I want to go in.

303
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,960
All right. I'll help you.

304
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:13,780
 Senior Brother, come with me. It's a rare and major surgery.

305
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,420
 Removal of meningiomas from the cerebellopontine angle.

306
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,620
 You're so excited! It must be a surgery led by Director Wang Huanzhong.

307
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,940
 It's led by Dr. Gu Yunzheng.

308
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,300
 I heard he excels in intervention, microsurgery and surgery.

309
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,515
 And he's maintained a zero operative mortality record.

310
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,215
 Awesome, right?

311
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,840
 I got something to do. You have to go alone.

312
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,390
 Okay, I'll go myself.

313
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,130
 Why is it that whatever I do, in your eyes, it's always just Gu Yunzheng?

314
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,440
Su Wei'an, you should get some rest.

315
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
I'm okay.

316
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,880
Su Wei'an, stop your work now. Go rest right now.

317
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,960
- Go eat. Or I'll have you leave the hospital now. 
- Excuse me.

318
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,820
Do you hear me?

319
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,100
 Isolation ward 803 has been cleared and disinfected.

320
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,760
 Isolation ward 803 has been cleared and disinfected.

321
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:40,280
 It's Gu Yunzheng's ward. What's happening to him?

322
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,120
 Seems like when the two of us are together, our luck truly gets a lot better.

323
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,560
 Some people never get the chance to see such beautiful scenery throughout their entire lives.

324
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:06,660
 But for some people, they just need to look up, and the precious night rainbow is hanging there waiting for them.

325
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,740
 Wei'an, I'm here.

326
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,713
 Su Wei'an,

327
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:28,460
 you keep pushing me away like this. Have you ever thought that

328
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,720
 if one day, an accident happens before the illness,

329
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,100
 and I were to leave you first, would you regret not being with me?

330
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,563
 Gu Yunzheng, I regret it.

331
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:53,798
 I'm so wrong. Please, be okay.

332
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:10,580
 Attention, all departments.

333
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,480
 The hospital has undergone several rounds of disinfection.

334
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,620
 Evaluated by experts, this building meets the standards to lift lockdown.

335
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,420
 Controls are lifted immediately.

336
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,520

337
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,940
Gu Yunzheng,

338
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,300
don't scare me, okay?

339
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,700
I lied to you.

340
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,740
It's not that I don't like you,

341
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,340
nor am I without regrets.

342
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,185
I never imagined a day like this.

343
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,160
I like you,

344
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,560
very, very much.

345
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,640
From the first time I saw you,

346
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,840
 before you even noticed me, I had already fallen for you,

347
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,900
until we reunited in Lakaya.

348
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,360
 I wanted to see you, but I was scared to face you.

349
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,960
 I feared my secret would be exposed.

350
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,360
 Me, a reject of nature, how could I deserve you?

351
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,060
But if I'd known there'd be a day like this,

352
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,540
I would've been braver.

353
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,660
Don't leave me, please.

354
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,220
Can you give me another chance?

355
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,840
I'll tell you in person

356
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,000
that I like you.

357
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,700
As long as you come back,

358
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,100
I promise you anything.

359
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,320
Deal?

360
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,200
Just now, why didn't you say a word? It scared me to death.

361
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,540
Controls have been lifted. Didn't you get the notice?

362
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,260
Otherwise, how could you run here without a hitch?

363
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,900
♫  My eyes fall on the lingering warmth of your palm  ♫

364
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,020
Wei'an,

365
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,460
every word you've just said. I'll remember it all.

366
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,700
♫  feeling unsettle from a nightmare  ♫

367
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:15,380
♫  Forgive me for relying too much  ♫

368
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,880
♫  on your hugs for comfort  ♫

369
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,120
♫  Your secret  ♫

370
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,180
Okay, stop crying.

371
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:31,980
With glasses on, I can't even wipe your tears.

372
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,090
I'm relieved you're okay.

373
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,460
♫  Oh~ woah~  ♫

374
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,340
Gu Yunzheng,

375
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,840
Are you still short on a girlfriend?

376
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,160
A sick one?

377
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,340
♫  Your secret  ♫

378
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,290
♫  Luckily, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

379
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,700
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

380
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,340
Wei'an,

381
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,500
never leave me again.

382
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
♫  My secret  ♫

383
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,220
♫  I've forgotten that I was lonely once  ♫

384
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,080
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

385
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,540
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

386
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,260
 According to the 20th bulletin of the city's Epidemic Control Headquarters,

387
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:42,240
 following the phased, categorized approach, today, the lockdown of controlled areas is lifted.

388
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,418
 Also, starting today,

389
00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:48,860
 the Affiliated Hospital of Huaren Medical University is no longer under lockdown.

390
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,850
Hang on.

391
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,020
Turn around.

392
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,540
One, two, three.

393
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,760
The sun's has risen from the west!

394
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,380
Did you put on makeup?

395
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,660
Looking good.

396
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:36,000
New dress, huh? Tell me, who is the boy?

397
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,720
What?

398
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm going to visit Jiang Jiang. I haven't seen her in so long.

399
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,140

400
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:59,560
 Dr. Gu, are you available? I want to book your emergency slot.

401
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,500

402
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,080

403
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,920

404
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,080
 What's the chief complaint?

405
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,180
 Complaint: For several days, I haven't seen my boyfriend, so I feel restless and have chest tightness.

406
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,580
 Diagnosed with lovesickness. Dr. Gu guarantees precise treatment and cure.

407
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,860
- Hurry up. 
 - Where are we heading?

408
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,520
We'll be late.

409
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,920
Didn't you do three surgeries today? Aren't you tired?

410
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,460
Are you doubting a surgeon's stamina?

411
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,700
There's something I've been wanting to do with my girlfriend.

412
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,360
I've been thinking about it so long. Today's perfect, let's go.

413
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,960
What's that about?

414
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,860
You'll see when we get there. Let's go.

415
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,380
So this is what you've always wanted to do with your girlfriend?

416
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,160
Yeah.

417
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,460
I really like watching horror movies, but I'm too scared to watch them alone.

418
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,060
At the hospital, I can't ask Fang Mingfan to come to the cinema.

419
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,600
That would be too strange, right?

420
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,180
But I won't be scared anymore.

421
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,540
Now that I have you, I won't miss any horror movies.

422
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
You're trying to trick me again.

423
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,780
I know what you're up to.

424
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,980
Trick you with what?

425
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,700
You just want me to be scared and rush into your arms.

426
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,160
Not at all. I'm really scared.

427
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,960
Stop pretending.

428
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm too scared to watch it.

429
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,920
There's a movie that says you can't scream if you see a ghost,

430
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,920
or your tongue will be pulled out.

431
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,320
I don't believe that.

432
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,320
Come on. Come on.

433
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,880
This way, I won't be scared.

434
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,220
It's all tricks.

435
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,900
Just stay here nicely, and we'll watch it together.

436
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,550
What are you laughing at?

437
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,620
I'm not laughing. I'm scared.

438
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,260
- Still scared? 
 - Uh-huh.

439
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,060
Dr. Gu,

440
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,200
do your patients and students know you're like this?

441
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,110
Like what?

442
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,860
Deliberately taking me to a horror movie and pretending to be scared.

443
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,720
I was really scared! If you don't believe me, feel my palm.

444
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,060
Feel it. Are my palms sweating from fear?

445
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,520
♫  That sweetness from the past  ♫

446
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,180
♫  It's beyond my reach  ♫

447
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:51,580
♫  It's as if fate is playing a game with me  ♫

448
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:55,220
♫  I still think of it from time to time  ♫

449
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,920
♫  It's hard to explain what I'm feeling  ♫

450
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,080
♫  Perhaps I understand it too well  ♫

451
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:10,400
♫  I don't want to be forgotten after being loved  ♫

452
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,920
♫  It's okay if you forget  ♫

453
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,760
♫  You were the one to give me courage  ♫

454
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,260
♫  I will always bless you for the scenery that I will never be able to wait for  ♫

455
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,220
♫  I will always bless you for the scenery that I will never be able to wait for  ♫

456

♫  Even if you forget, it doesn't matter  ♫

457
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,600
♫  It's my way of saving myself  ♫

459
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,960
♫  and never given up  ♫

460
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,580
Hey, Senior Brother.

461
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,360
What's the situation?

462
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,180
Okay, I got it. Thank you, Senior Brother.

463
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,380
What happened?

464
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,540
I had asked my seniors from neurosurgery of various hospitals to keep an eye on their aneurysm patients

465
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,240
to see if any of them had participated in the HDQ39 trial.

466
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,180
Just now, a Senior Brother from the Second Hospital told me that one of their patients, Tian Li,

467
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:31,000
just suddenly suffered an aneurysm rupture and died despite rescue efforts.

468
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Was he also a subject of the HDQ39 trial?

469
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,400
Just like your aunt's situation.

470
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,260
This is the third case of aneurysm rupture among the trial subjects.

471
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,500
Indeed, my aunt's aneurysm was not an isolated case.

472
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,580
Professor Wen must take this seriously.

473
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,778
 Senior Brother, my aunt wasn't the only trial subject with a sudden aneurysm.

474
00:40:59,778 --> 00:41:01,978
 Did you know this?

475
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,680
What was Yang Wenbin's opinion?

476
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,480
Director Yang said it's an extremely rare individual case. It won't happen again.

477
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,620
Everything is under control, and it won't affect HDQ39's schedule to go on the market.

478
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,220
We've signed a bet-on agreement with the investors.

479
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,500
If negative news affects the company's valuation,

480
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,480
I'll lose the controlling stake in the company.

481
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,400
At this critical moment, we can't afford any mistakes on HDQ39.

482
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,740
Don't worry. I'll convey your message to Director Yang.

483
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,920
He definitely hopes more than any of us that HDQ39 can go on the market on schedule.

484
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,880
At Zhang He Hospital, it will be his most successful promotion record.

485
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,540

486
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,085
Don't stop at the entrance. Drive faster.

487
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:09,430
What's wrong, Xiao Yang?

488
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,540
Nothing.

489
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,640
I heard there were some medical disputes. I don't want any trouble.

490
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,120
Professor Wen!

491
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,280
I couldn't see Professor Wen today.

492
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,362
Su Wei'an, aren't you going to verify it for yourself?

493
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,240
Why don't you join my lab?

494
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,300
I need a research assistant. Together, we will surely find the answer.

495
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,160
I won't join.

496
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,060
Why not?

497
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:10,170

498
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:15,000
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen
