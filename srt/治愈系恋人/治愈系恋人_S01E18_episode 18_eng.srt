 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuoxuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,360
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,540
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,700
♫  May you find her admist the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:17,280
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,920
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,680

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,980

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,740
You said you were entertaining me on behalf of your mentor,

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,080
but your attention was all on her these days.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,700
And President Du from Jiehui is the same.

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,980
Receiving me is not your real intention.

20
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:58,740
Except looking cute, I can't see what's so unusual about this little girl.

21
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:05,980
She could always bring some surprises.

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,480
Dr. Lu, I made this especially for you. It's called Déjà Vu.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Déjà Vu?

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,340
Why did you give it this name?

25
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,080
It means seeming familiar in French.

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,940
For example, if a person comes to a place he's been longing for, he will have a strong sense of shock and familiarity.

27
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,460
He may even have a feeling that he's been here before.

28
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,740
Do you like it?

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,080
So?

30
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,500
Dr. Lu, you were born in Jinhai City.

31
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,020
Though you've left for decades, and the landmark buildings here are no longer what you remembered,

32
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,980
you still took a lot of photos and spoke like a dictionary on their history.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,660
Everything in your hometown is still familiar to you. So I named it Déjà Vu.

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm beginning to understand what you were saying about the surprises.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,620
Let's have a toast. Dr. Lu, welcome home.

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,420
Hope you can find the sense of belonging that you've been longing for in the days to come.

37
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,840
All right, thanks.

38
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,080
However,

39
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,160
no matter how great you are at fawning over me, I don't plan to sell my patent to Jiehui.

40
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,360
Is it because this patent has defects?

41
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,665
How did you know this? It's rare.

42
00:03:54,665 --> 00:04:01,800
I thought Jiehui would never know this, and they assumed that I was only unsatisfied with the price.

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,360
You've been keeping this information from the public.

44
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,480
I made this bold speculation because I saw the news.

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,640
Which news?

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,835
When personalized standard brain atlas real-time navigation technology enters clinical trials,

47
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:22,080
you said, as long as this technology can save one more person, your lifelong research will not be in vain.

48
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,900
I guess, if a person could say something like that,

49
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,760
he would never delay it from entering the Chinese market for the price.

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,500
The number of deaths caused by glioma in China every year has reached 30,000.

51
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,100
The reason behind this must be that the technology is not yet perfect.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,140
Dr. Lu, Huaren's scientific research ability is evident to everyone.

53
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,080
We can work together to solve this problem.

54
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,020
But to study neuronavigation systems, it is necessary to combine stereotactic technology,

55
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,340
modern imaging technology, AI, minimally invasive surgery techniques, and so on.

56
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,600
Strong financial support is needed for this.

57
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,080
So, Dr. Lu, I think Jiehui is your best choice.

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,300
Let me ask you. How do you maintain the purity of research in profit-driven companies?

59
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,360
Dr. Lu, although President Du is a businessman now, he was an excellent doctor.

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,900
He chooses to develop medicine because he wants to help doctors cure and save more people.

61
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,360
So Du Yuncheng is perfect in your mind.

62
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,500
Are you done with this? We are talking about work.

63
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,200
- I am talking about work. 
 - Don't involve your personal grudges.

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,860
I...

65
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,880
It's boring talking about work. How about this?

66
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,380
Miss Su has just performed for us. Dr. Gu, it's your turn.

67
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,100
If you win higher cheers, I'd work with Huaren.

68
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,440
Dr. Lu, how could you decide such a big thing in a childish way like this?

69
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,740
It's my patent. I can sell it to whoever I want.

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
I'm this old now.

71
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,700
Money can't buy me happiness. Just for fun.

72
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,880
Dr. Lu, that's a deal.

73
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
Girl,

74
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,940
have some patience.

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Excuse me, guys. Please give me a few minutes.

76
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,720
Do you guys like rainbows?

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Anyway, for me, it means a lot.

78
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,600
I want to take this chance

79
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,280
to give the most beautiful rainbow in my heart to the most special one.

80
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,420
♫  Your secret  ♫

81
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,400
♫  I was able to hear you sleep talk while you dream  ♫

82
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,280
♫  With a smile, I'm secretly writing down all your wishes  ♫

83
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,060
Look, it's a rainbow.

84
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,900
Yes, it's beautiful.

85
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,580
So beautiful.

86
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,360
♫  My secret  ♫

87
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,220
♫  I've forgotten that I was so alone  ♫

88
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:01,200
♫  I'm hoping in the future, you'd still be tugging on the corner of my sleeves  ♫

89
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,540
 Seems like when the two of us are together, our luck truly gets a lot better.

90
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,600
 Some people never get the chance to see such beautiful scenery throughout their entire lives.

91
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,940
 But for some people, they just need to look up, and the precious night rainbow is hanging there waiting for them.

92
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
♫  Your secret  ♫

93
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,020
♫  Luckily, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

94
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,560
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

95
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,340
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

96
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,080
♫  My secret  ♫

97
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,740
♫  I've forgotten that I was lonely once  ♫

98
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:49,300
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

99
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,240
♫  Oh~, in my all, oh~ in my all  ♫

100
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,880
♫  Oh~, in my all, oh~ in my all  ♫

101
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,620
♫  Oh~, in my all, oh~ in my all  ♫

102
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,900
Yuncheng, it was my fault.

103
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,840
I shouldn't quarrel with you. You liked Su Wei'an.

104
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,120
It's normal to do something for her. Please don't be mad at me.

105
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,700
Look, Yuncheng, I still keep our love token, this little bear.

106
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:49,080
Wen Ran, don't play tricks with me again.

107
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,280
You deceived me with my mom. It doesn't work for me.

108
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,780
Yuncheng, I'm sorry.

109
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,380
I didn't mean to deceive you.

110
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,140
After breaking up with you, I couldn't drink or eat.

111
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,400
I know I shouldn't bother you.

112
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,500
If Auntie Cui hadn't reached out to me, I wouldn't have told her that we had broken up.

113
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,280
Do you know why my mom likes you?

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,140
We have similar tastes and interests. We have common topics to talk about.

115
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,940
If she weren't your mom, we would have been good friends.

116
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,600
Why are you laughing, Yuncheng?

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,740
Good friends. Common topics.

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,540
Do you know how much she's done to please you?

119
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,820
She hates exercising, but she signed up for a yoga class with you.

120
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,760
She bought clothes from your favorite brands, but she never wore them.

121
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,920
We are in a relationship, but she put in the most effort.

122
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,320
Do you think it's funny?

123
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,110
But why did she do this?

124
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,580
I never asked her to like the things I like.

125
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,220
Because, in her eyes, the Wen and Du families are of equal social rank.

126
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,820
And you are the best choice for her daughter-in-law.

127
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,420
I don't mind, Yuncheng.

128
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,440
As long as I can be with you, I won't mind these things.

129
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Wen Ran,

130
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,640
if I tell you that I've never liked you.

131
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,740
Don't you mind?

132
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Why did you be with me if you didn't like me?

133
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,160
Why? You don't know why?

134
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,860
You are just using me.

135
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,220
You threatened me. You threatened me with your father.

136
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,620
You knew how important HDQ39 was to me.

137
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,800
Yuncheng,

138
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,560
I thought you could fall in love with me gradually if I treated you better.

139
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,060
I don't understand.

140
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,780
How is Su Wei'an better than me?

141
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,360
Yuncheng, it's still the same now. Nothing has changed.

142
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,080
I can still give you everything you want.

143
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,320
Please don't break up with me.

144
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,660
Can you have some dignity, Wen Ran?

145
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,060
Yuncheng, you know how much I love you.

146
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,980
Dignity means nothing in front of love.

147
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Sorry, to me, your love means nothing.

148
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,080
Bye. Take care.

149
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,840
Goodnight, Dr. Lu. See you tomorrow.

150
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Have a good rest.

151
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,920
The result of today's competition is obvious.

152
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,960
You lost.

153
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,040
But I don't feel like working with Huaren, either.

154
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,920
- What? Why? Dr. Lu, a deal is a deal. 
 - Why?

155
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,080
Dr. Lu can do whatever he wants. It's his patent.

156
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,300
How about this? If you work together

157
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,620
and can improve this technology together, maybe I can think about this.

158
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,360
- Okay. 
 - Impossible.

159
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,300
What are you talking about?

160
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,880
We can do it.

161
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,160
Dr. Lu, I'm not a researcher of Jiehui.

162
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,820
I'm just a help to receive you.

163
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,620
You are so focused on this, and you are so familiar with the development of neuronavigation technology.

164
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,120
I thought you were a researcher.

165
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm just a helper.

166
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,640
President Du is so lucky. Even a temporary worker is so responsible.

167
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,820
Others may think Jiehui is operated by a husband and wife pair.

168
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,960
No.

169
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,820
She's always responsible for her temporary work.

170
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,380
Never mind. I don't think we can work together this time.

171
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,460
- Hold on, Dr. Lu. 
 - Bye-bye.

172
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,360
Dr. Lu, are you sure you're willing to waste your decades of hard work?

173
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,740
Please think about it.

174
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,160
It's too late.

175
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,800
- Dr. Lu. 
 - Dr. Lu.

176
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,400
That's it.

177
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,420
It's raining. It's hard to take a taxi. Let me take you back.

178
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,860
No need. It's all your fault.

179
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,440
I have important things to tell you about your aunt.

180
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,496
I'm not so sure if your aunt's aneurysm is related to the drug testing

181
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:14,660
or how much they are related, but just to play it safe, I suggest stopping the drug test first.

182
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,800
Why?

183
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,260
I have reviewed all the relevant materials of HDQ39.

184
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,736
Among a total of 100 testees in clinical phase I and phase II,

185
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:29,080
none existed in this kind of situation.

186
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,352
However, there have been reports of aneurysms in mice in animal experimental papers

187
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:36,337
during the HDQ39 molecular development phase.

188
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:41,242
This does not necessarily indicate that HDQ39 can lead to aneurysms, though.

189
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,480
However, HDQ39 significantly alleviated my aunt's movement disorders.

190
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,040
My aunt only stopped the medicine for three days, and her symptoms reappeared.

191
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,020
But Wei'an, I still suggest stopping the medicine first to rule out this possibility.

192
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,120
No. I'm afraid stopping the medicine will affect my aunt.

193
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,340
I know you are avoiding me, but please don't doubt my professional advice because of this.

194
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm not. But we can't stop the medicine rashly because of speculation.

195
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,400
HDQ39 is my aunt's only hope now.

196
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,640

197
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,440
Hello, Senior Brother.

198
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,540
What are you doing?

199
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,980
I hate to see you with Du Yuncheng.

200
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,580
I hate him calling you.

201
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,840
I hate him screwing the bottle cap for you.

202
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,640
I hate the way he looks at you. I hate the way he talks to you.

203
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,640
- I don't know why. I feel angry when I see you with him. 
 - Does it have anything to do with you?

204
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,405
This is where I am most angry.

205
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,440
Su Wei'an, what do you think of the things that happened between us?

206
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,540
We went through so much in Lakaya together. Do you think you can just end it because you want to?

207
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,240
- Or do you think you can end this without an explanation? 
 - Yes.

208
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm just like that. I like giving up halfway.

209
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,660
Fine.

210
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,550
Why do you keep the stone with you?

211
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,240
What stone?

212
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,700
What are you doing?

213
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,080
Explain this.

214
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,300
This stone reminds me of the dark rainbow. It has nothing to do with you.

215
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,800
Really?

216
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,020
Fine.

217
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,660
If that's the case, you won't mind if I throw it.

218
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
Gu Yunzheng,

219
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,080
can we stop this?

220
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,920
We've left Lakaya. Why are you still trapped there?

221
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,660
Yes.

222
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,060
I was down and out and bored, then you appeared.

223
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,900
But if it wasn't you, there would be others.

224
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,840
It's time to wake up from the dream, the story should be over.

225
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,360
Wei'an.

226
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,980
Your entanglement with me now is only your one-sided wish.

227
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,620
Wei'an,

228
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,680
we shouldn't be like this.

229
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,280
♫  Who among us is not a lost soul searching for that one-in-a-billion chance?  ♫

230
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,500
♫  And trapped in this city called fate, yet we're still chasing stars  ♫

♫  Don't worry, my beloved lost love  ♫

233
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,860
I can tell you now.

♫  Let me embrace your scars  ♫

235
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
We can't be together.

♫  Your brilliance shines like a star, my beacon in the darkest night  ♫

243
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,080
An An, are you all right? Why are you back so late?

244
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,185
 Su Wei'an, what do you think of the things that happened between us?

245
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:15,320
 We went through so much in Lacaya together. Do you think you can just end it because you want to?

246
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,400
 Or do you think you can end this without an explanation?

247
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,080
 Can we stop this? We've left Lakaya. Why are you still trapped there?

248
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,040
 If you want an answer, we can't be together.

249
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,180
 Hello, the number you've dialed is busy now.

250
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,600
You block me.

251
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,500
You still block me.

252
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,640
Hey, why did she blackmail me?

253
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Sir, we are closing now. Shall I contact your friend to pick you up?

254
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay. Call her.

255
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,500
Ask her to come here to pick me up.

256
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,460
Sir, what's your password? I can't unlock your phone.

257
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,820
Well, six zeros.

258
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,640
Hello.

259
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes.

260
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,440
Mr. Gu you are looking for is drunk in our bar. Can you come and pick him up?

261
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,000
Dr. Gu, you are awake.

262
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,600
Where am I? Why are you here?

263
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,360
It's a hotel. As to why I am here, what do you think?

264
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,520
I drank too much last night. I can't remember anything.

265
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,600
But from a biological perspective, a hangover man is absolutely impossible to engage in drunken promiscuity.

266
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Dr. Li, please leave us both some dignity.

267
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,640
For your dignity, I dragged you here from the bar.

268
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,580
You vomited on your coat. I cleaned and air-dried it for you.

269
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,300
But now you're completely ungrateful. And you are blaming me now.

270
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,740
Gu Yunzheng, you are heartless.

271
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,160
Sorry, I wronged you.

272
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,600
I wouldn't say you wronged me.

273
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
I had other intentions last night,

274
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,080
but I tried everything to move you to this bed, and you just fell asleep.

275
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,420
I couldn't wake you up.

276
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,200
Why was it you that moved me here?

277
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,400
Who do you hope it would be?

278
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,400
Su Wei'an?

279
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,540
I've heard this name so many times last night.

280
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,080
Tell me, how did she abandon you?

281
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,880
Enough.

282
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,020
With your look and IQ, you have perfect genes.

283
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,580
This Su Wei'an has bad vision.

284
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,540
Gu Yunzheng, you're abandoned, and I'm single.

285
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,200
Why don't we be together?

286
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,260
Gu Yunzheng, you have no tenderness toward women.

287
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,120
Li Wantong, you're the person who needs to see a psychologist the most.

288
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm going to work. Get off.

289
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm going to work too, Dr. Gu.

290
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,220
We have the same destination. Taking two taxis is not environmentally friendly.

291
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,460
Huaren Hospital, please.

292
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,980
- It's said... That they went to the hotel together. 
 - You are here.

293
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,170
You came alone?

294
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,560
I come here alone every day.

295
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,920
You got off the same taxi with Dr. Li. It's all over Huaren's chat groups.

296
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,320
Fang Mingfan, are you lonely when you are not doing surgeries?

297
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,420
Do you want to stay in the emergency dept for a few months?

298
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,140
Dr. Lu.

299
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,460
Dr. Lu. Are you in there?

300
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,660
Is it possible he's not inside?

301
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,040
Call him.

302
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,160
His phone is inside.

303
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,700
Why didn't he open the door?

304
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,180
Dr. Lu.

305
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,120
Ask the room manager.

306
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,560
- Dr. Lu. 
 - Dr. Lu.

307
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,140
- Dr. Lu. 
 - Dr. Lu

308
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,620
The guest in room 403 fainted.

309
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,625
Right, yes. Okay.

310
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,640
Heartbeat and pulse are normal.

311
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,140

312
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,380
Apatinib.

313
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,620
It is for cancer.

314
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,400

315
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,400
The examination results show that Dr. Lu is in the advanced stage of gastric cancer,

316
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,940
and it's likely that it has already metastasized.

317
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,240
If that's the case, how long can he live?

318
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,300
At present, the world's average survival period of advanced, recurrent gastric cancer

319
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,080
with negative HER-2 after comprehensive treatment such as chemotherapy is approximately six to twelve months.

320
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,300
Without proper treatment, the survival period is only about three months.

321
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,080
When the patient is awake, I will ask him about his medical history in detail.

322
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,620
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

323
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,580
Wei'an, you've done great.

324
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,900
Senior Brother, what about the patent?

325
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,400
It's already like this. There's no need to force it anymore.

326
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,600
Thank you for taking care of Dr. Lu these days. Go back and have a rest.

327
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,100
I'll find someone to look after Dr. Lu.

328
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,500
I'll go pick up my aunt. She's discharged today.

329
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,540
By the way, Senior Brother, have you reported to Prof. Wen about my aunt's aneurysm?

330
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,940
Is he certain that the aneurysm has nothing to do with HDQ39,

331
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,380
so he didn't stop the drug trial?

332
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,980
You suspect the aneurysm is related to the drug trial?

333
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,640
Dr. Gu has this speculation.

334
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,920
According to regulations, serious adverse events should be reported immediately.

335
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,120
If HDQ39 is related to the aneurysm,

336
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,940
we would have to stop the trial.

337
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,240
Of course. However, it still depends on Professor Wen's consideration

338
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,220
and the decision of the competent department responsible for clinical trials.

339
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,660
Oh my. We just broke up,

340
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,700
and now you are always together. What a lovely couple.

341
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,160
Are you so anxious?

342
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,380
Wen Ran, mind your words.

343
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,160
We broke up in peace. Don't speak so ambiguously.

344
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,120
Su Wei'an, I broke up with Yuncheng because of you.

345
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,860
Are you satisfied now?

346
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,160
You stole my authorship position at school, and now you are stealing my boyfriend.

347
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,100
Why are you always stealing from others?

348
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,700
Wen Ran, I'll give these words back to you. I don't want to fight with you.

349
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:33,940
If you spread rumors or intervene in my personal life again, I'll teach you a lesson.

350
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,400
Wei'an, come back.

351
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,060
Wen Ran.

352
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,620
It's enough.

353
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,600
 According to the examination, Dr. Lu has advanced gastric cancer.

354
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,520
 Director Wang wants you to see him representing our department.

355
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,400
 He'll see him when he's back from the meeting of the Health Commission.

356
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,220
Gu Yunzheng,

357
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,200
it's you again.

358
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,160
Don't you have to work?

359
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,880
Gu Yunzheng, you've been having continuous surgeries or leaving early these days.

360
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,940
You are avoiding me. You can't take it now?

361
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,120
You'll be fascinated by me later.

362
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,680
And I'm so sad. You weren't so cold that night.

363
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
Wei'an.

364
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,580
Dr. Gu.

365
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,280
Dr. Gu.

366
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,580
Dr. Li, it's working hours.

367
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,320
Please go back to your own work station. Do not affect my work.

368
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm here for work.

369
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,360
I'm here to discuss the feasibility of interdisciplinary cooperation with you.

370
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,920
Dr. Li.

371
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,320
You're right. Clinically, interdisciplinary cooperation is indeed practical and urgent.

372
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,400
Dr. Gu, accept my WeChat invitation for business discussion.

373
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,280
I've been sending you invitations for days.

374
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,450

(TN: Email address is for this drama specific, please do not use.)

375
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,660
Email is faster.

376
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,340
There are so many people here.

377
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,460
Auntie Yuan, it's all right.

378
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,020
Auntie Yuan, let me carry you. Let's go through the stairs. It's faster.

379
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,300
- Is that okay? 
 - No problem.

380
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,320
- All right. 
 - Thanks, Senior Brother.

381
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,800
- You're welcome. 
 - Come.

382
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,660
Slowly. One, two, three. All right.

383
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,460
Be careful.

384
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,182
- Okay. Give me the wheelchair. 
 - Mom.

385
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:07,040
- You push the wheelchair. 
 - Put on this for her. Let's go.

386
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,420
Auntie Yuan, how do you feel using our HDQ39?

387
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,380
The effect of this medicine is quite obvious. I have fewer cases of uncontrolled limbs.

388
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,740
I read your discharge report. Your doctor requested that you have to stop the drug.

389
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,360
Stop the drug trial? Why?

390
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,520
I feel a little better. Why stop it?

391
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,560
Auntie Yuan, don't worry.

392
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Gu Yunzheng is worried that your aneurysm may be related to the drug trial

393
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,720
So he suggested this. I'll consult Professor Wen for more.

394
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,840
Do others have an aneurysm?

395
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,820
No, it's just you.

396
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,820
Then it's not related to this drug. I can't stop the drug trial. I can't.

397
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,860
- It's okay, Auntie Yuan. 
 - I can't stop the medicine.

398
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,380
Wei'an.

399
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,080
Thanks.

400
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,360
Come. Slowly.

401
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,760
- Where's Wei'an? 
 - I will pick her up.

402
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,860
- Where is she? 
 - Sister-in-law. It's all my fault.

403
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:10,140
Wei'an fell down the stairs.

404
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,440
Senior Brother.

405
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,680
I told you to wait for me in place.

406
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,840
It's not that bad. I don't want to make Auntie Yuan sad.

407
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,265
Senior Brother, put me down. I'm really fine.

408
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:26,920
Don't move.

409
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,220
- I'm really fine, Senior Brother. Put me down. They are watching us. 
 - Don't move.

410
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,120
Let me down.

411
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,870

412
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,100
What happened, Boss?

413
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,620

414
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,100
This is an injury ointment. You may feel cold at first, but you are going to feel comfortable soon.

415
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,420
I'm fine, Senior Brother. It's just a small injury. I'm fine.

416
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,060
An An, I'm sorry.

417
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,820
I'm fine, Auntie Yuan. It doesn't hurt.

418
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,220
A'Yuan, it's okay. Wei'an is not delicate.

419
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,000
She fell off the wall when she was a kid, and she's fine.

420
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,560
Are you my real mother?

421
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,580
Of course.

422
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:15,540
Yuncheng, can you give some injury ointment to a square dance queen like me?

423
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,800
- No problem. It's yours. 
 - Thanks.

424
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,640
Wei'an, Yuncheng takes care of us a lot when your aunt was sick this time.

425
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,700
- You have to thank him. 
 - Of course.

426
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,117
Did you say you want to take him to some Pearl or Michelin?

427
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:30,700
Black Pearl Michelin.

428
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,000
- Right. 
 - No need. I'm fine.

429
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm easy to be pleased. I just want mushrooms with beef.

430
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,700
All right, let's go. Pick a place. My treat.

431
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,840
Yes. Let's go.

432
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000

433
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,180
 Mommy, look. The lady is rotating her wrists. Are they making a video?

434
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,180
 Like this. Look how good I am.

435
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,380
 Don't be so impolite.

436
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,040

437
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,540

438
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,240
Dr. Gu.

439
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,900
I thought I mistook someone for you. Aren't you off today?

440
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,640
I'm back for materials. I have things to do. Bye.

441
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,220
Dr. Li, I don't want to be impolite to ladies. Don't push me.

442
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,100
I've been inviting you so many times. Out of your politeness, let's have dinner together.

443
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,600
I won't have dinner with you. Dinners after work are unnecessary.

444
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,200
You will.

445
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,440
Hello, Director. I'm in contact with Dr. Gu.

446
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,720
I'm with him right now. Okay, you tell him.

447
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,540
Hello, Director Wang. It's me.

448
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,760
Interdisciplinary cooperation pilot unit.

449
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,760
Okay. Got it.

450
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,160
Director Wang Huanzhong wants me to treat you to dinner on behalf of the department.

451
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,380
Okay. I'm happy to go.

452
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,900
Enjoy.

453
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,740
This is mushrooms with beef?

454
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,180
This small dish costs so much.

455
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,240
M9 Australian wagyu beef with this season's white truffles.

456
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,260
You have to savor it to live up to the craftsmanship of an old master.

457
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,780
How much would this meal cost me?

458
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,520
Never mind. My treat today.

459
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,080
Order anything you like. Let's break relations after this meal.

460
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,640
No.

461
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,100
I'm waiting for you to be my best assistant in Jiehui.

462
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,320
Hello, this is your dish. Enjoy.

463
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,000
Thanks.

464
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,700
Are we eating food? We are eating money.

465
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, they have a special dessert.

466
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
- This season's must-order. 
 - More?

467
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,200
I can watch you eat.

468
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,040
You'll regret it. This is special in this season.

469
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,600
A white truffle ice cream, please.

470
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,560
I want a white truffle ice cream.

471
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,640
Sorry, our white truffle ice cream has a high demand for the freshness of ingredients.

472
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,540
It's limited. We can only make one now.

473
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,440
- You can discuss who can cancel the order. 
 - How much for one?

474
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,000
- Six hundred yuan for one. 
 - Let them have it.

475
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,760
It sold out.

476
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,292
Miss, today's limited white truffle ice cream has only one left.

477
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,140
The two guests at the bar gave this out to you.

478
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,700
Really? We have to thank them. Give them two caramel puddings. My treat.

479
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,300
Okay.

480
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,520
Miss Su.

481
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,800
You also like their limited white truffle ice cream? What a coincidence!

482
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,120
Shall we have a meal together?

483
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,660
- Senior Brother, are you full? 
 - Yes.

484
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,440
Can we have the bill, please?

485
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,840
I've settled the bill from President Du's membership card.

486
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,240
They are leaving. Aren't you coming to say hi?

487
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,440
What a coincidence! Dr. Li and I...

488
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
Let's go.

489
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,670
We are talking about work.

490
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,340
So they are together.

491
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,540
I thought they had something that day at the bar.

492
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,640
They aren't.

493
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,520
Dr. Li, are you done eating? I'll pay the bill.

494
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:11,030

495
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,020
