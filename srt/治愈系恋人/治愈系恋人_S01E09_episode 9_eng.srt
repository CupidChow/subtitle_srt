16
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,220
Forget it.

17
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,420
It's better than nothing.

18
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,040
I'll take this one. He'll pay.

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,240
Okay.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,180
How much is it?

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,120
It's 280 USD.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,240
Your boyfriend is so nice.

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,520
No, we're not in that kind of relationship.

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,620

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,080
Honey, where are we going now?

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,340
From now on, for the French you don't understand, don't nod randomly, so we can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,780
Are you talking about when we bought the phone just now? What misunderstanding did I cause?

28
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,500
It's nothing.

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,420
- What are you doing? 
 - Let me borrow it for a bit.

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,200

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,380
I'm done.

32
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,540
Handsome.

33
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,140
Wait.

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,140
How did I not notice you were so narcissistic before?

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,520
Handsome Gu.

36
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,520
I set my number as your emergency contact.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,320
Whenever you find yourself in a tough spot in the future, call this number, and I’ll be there.

38
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
Hello?

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,540
Hello, emergency contact.

40
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,600
There's a super shameless person next to me right now.

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,400
Can you help me get rid of him?

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,140
At your service.

43
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,340
Where do you want to go, Boss Su?

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,320
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,060
Stop fighting.

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,380
Looks like it's the person who stabbed you.

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,620
- Stop fighting! 
 - What are you doing?

48
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,140
Stop fighting!

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,080
Help me.

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,020
I think it's a ruptured spleen. He needs to get to a hospital immediately.

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,800
- Use my wheelchair. 
 - Okay.

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,980
What are you all waiting for? Help us out!

53
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,540
If he dies, you'll all be legally responsible.

54
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,440
Hurry up and help.

55
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
- If something happens, you'll be responsible. 
 - Hurry!

56
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,040
Wei'an.

57
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,080
Just wait for me here. Don't go anywhere.

58
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,580
Wait for me.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,260
Hello?

60
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,580
Contact Dr. Xu. Dr. Gu will send an injured person to the hospital.

61
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Boss.

62
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,940
Hurry!

63
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,820
Here, let me.

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,060
Quickly.

65
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,860
Hurry up!

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,840
Be careful.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,560
Boss, the emergency department already got a call from Interpreter Su.

68
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
- The operating room is ready. 
 - Call the police first.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,500
The injured person is a human trafficker.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,420
I'll go first.

71
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,220
Where are you going, Boss?

72
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,580
Su Wei'an is still waiting for me.

73
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,080
Boss, the wheelchair!

74
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,440
Su Wei'an's wheelchair!

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,120
Su Wei'an.

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,080
Su Wei'an!

♫  Another wave, how often do they come?  ♫

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,500
♫  Love, like a moth, risking it all  ♫

80
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,420
♫  Willing to sacrifice itself for the light  ♫

♫  How do we prove its sincerity?  ♫

85
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,160
Let's go.

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,480
Good for you. You secretly filmed me.

87
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
What do you mean "secretly?"

88
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,580
I was filming you in the open.

89
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,260
Where's my wheelchair?

90
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,960
I... I forgot it.

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,160
How will I get back then?

92
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,020
I'll carry you back to the hospital.

93
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,060
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,080
Now you know to tighten your belly.

95
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,380
I didn't.

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,180
Don't talk nonsense. I'm not heavy at all.

97
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,220
I thought you would care about me carrying you all the way back like this.

98
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,340
Will my arms get sore?

99
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,580
Then are your arms sore?

100
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,080
Yes. Because you're too heavy.

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,100
Why do I think it’s time for you to exercise?

102
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
Can you do it?

103
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Can I do it?

104
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,280
I mean...

105
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,720
I'll eat a little less next time.

106
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,720
There's no need.

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,600
As a patient, you should eat more, recover quickly, and cause less trouble for the doctor.

108
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,700
Enjoy your meal.

109
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,760
Isn't it a little late to start learning French now?

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,360
Then please give me some extra guidance, Miss Su.

111
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
Sure.

112
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,880
Now is Miss Su’s on-call teaching time.

113
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,340
Okay.

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,700
Cough.

115
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,220
Cough.

116
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,020
- Retina. 
 - Retina.

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,400
- Liver. 
 - Liver.

118
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,380
Boyfriend.

119
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,700
Rib.

120
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,660
Miss Su.

121
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,960
The last word means boyfriend.

122
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,180
So you know what it means?

123
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Then why did you still nod at the phone store?

124
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Right.

125
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,340
Why did I nod?

126
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,970

127
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,880

128
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,680
You're recovering well.

129
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,340
Dr. Xu.

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,160
Thank you.

131
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
You're still a bit anemic.

132
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,940
I'll prescribe you some ferrous sulfate tablets.

133
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,240
Ferrous sulfate tablets again?

134
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,140
Did someone prescribe them for you before?

135
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,500
No.

136
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,160
By the way, Dr. Xu, I'm feeling much better now.

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,360
Send me the information that needs to be translated.

138
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
I can start translating now.

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,970
Do you have QQ? 
  (TN: Instant messaging software service)

140
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,240
I'll send it to you offline through QQ.

141
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,160
Do people still use QQ in this day and age?

142
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
This...

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,160
Sure.

144
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,720
Send me your QQ number.

145
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,320
But you're just starting to recover.

146
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,470
Don't overexert yourself.

147
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,920
There's no need to rush. Just take your time translating.

148
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,010
Thank you.

149
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,240
Okay, I'll head out then.

150
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,840

151
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,320
Yuncheng, do you want a latte or an Americano?

152
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,120
The usual.

153
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,130
One latte without ice and one Americano with double espresso. Thank you.

154
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,630
Okay.

155
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
Let me call Assistant Lin back.

156
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,120
Okay.

157
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,640

158
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,530
Su Wei'an?

159
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,760

160
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,740
Hello, Wei'an.

161
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,680
 Long time no see.

162
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,840
Is there a problem?

163
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,520
 Can't I just chat with you for no reason?

164
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,760
Look at you. You just dropped out of school and disappeared for three years.

165
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,500
 Everyone missed you so much.

166
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,920
 I haven’t heard from you for so long. I’ve been worried sick.

167
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,340
Are you still mad at me?

168
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,640
 It's been so long. I stopped being mad at you a long time ago.

169
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,260
We're best friends.

170
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
 Who are you chatting with?

171
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,340
Yuncheng, look. Look who it is.

172
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,360
Wei'an.

173
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,060
Wei'an!

174
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,900
 Senior, long time no see.

175
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,620
I didn't expect you two to be together.

176
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,160
 Congratulations.

177
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,240
Thank you.

178
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,340
Wei'an, where are you?

179
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,400
Why are you wearing a hospital gown?

180
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
 Are you in the hospital?

181
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,960
Wait, you really are, Wei'an.

182
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,400
Are you okay? I was so excited just now that I didn't even notice.

183
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,740
 It's nothing.

184
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,200
It was just a minor injury.

185
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Is that French on the wall behind you?

186
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,320
 Wei'an, where in the world are you?

187
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,680
- I'm in Lakaya. 
 - Lakaya?

188
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,720
Why did you go there? Do you know how dangerous it is?

189
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,260
There were reports of gunfire in Lakaya in the news just last month.

190
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,160
Yuncheng, is it really that serious?

191
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Wei'an.

192
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,420
Your idol, Professor Gu, is also in Lakaya.

193
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,400
Did you see him?

194
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
 What idol?

195
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 Dr. Gu calculated it quite well.

196
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,920
Two years in Lakaya is equivalent to four years of clinical work in China.

197
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,900
After returning home from Lakaya, he'll definitely be promoted to a full professor.

198
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,700
After returning home from Lakaya, he'll definitely be promoted to a full professor.

199
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,140
You can go find out what he's up to.

200
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm not sure.

201
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,700
Wei'an, are you still—

202
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,180

203
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,420
Yuncheng, you should go answer the phone.

204
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,320
Go ahead.

205
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,240
Hello?

206
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,200
Wei'an, I'm sorry.

207
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,840
 I happen to have something to ask you.

208
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,320
 When I was in the lab, the false positives on the background of the stain were particularly serious.

209
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,960
 When I was in the lab, the false positives on the background of the stain were particularly serious.

210
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,580
I remember it wasn't like this before.

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,720
There could be several reasons. How long has the serum been sealed?

212
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,840
Half an hour.

213
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,280
Try increasing it to one hour.

214
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Right.

215
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,360
When we were in the lab back then, the professor did mention it.

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,800
 You see, I've been so busy lately that I forgot.

217
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,880
The professor never mentioned it.

218
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
It was me.

219
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,740

220
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,280
I thought you were going to get bullied by this devious girl again.

221
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,120
She made you suffer so much back then.

222
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,360
Who would dare to bully me with you around?

223
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,480
You're the only best friend I have in the world.

224
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,520
Oh, come on.

225
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,560
It hurts.

226
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Sorry, did I touch your wound?

227
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,280
Let me take a look. Hurry.

228
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,320
Stop.

229
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Don't even think about touching this girl.

230
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,840
I...

231
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,320
You seem quite happy being naughty.

232
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,060
Let's see what delicious food you brought me.

233
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,920
This big bun.

234
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,960
You have no idea how bored I am being alone here every day.

235
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,160
You have no idea how bored I am being alone here every day.

236
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,680
Luckily, I have you to keep me company.

237
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,880
Soon, I won't be able to keep you company anymore.

238
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
This weekend, we're going with Dr. Gu to the free clinic in Labe Village.

239
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,040
Labe Village?

240
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Without you there, I'll have to shoulder the translation duties for the entire medical team on my own.

241
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,380
Without you there, I'll have to shoulder the translation duties for the entire medical team on my own.

242
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,680
Then I'll go with you.

243
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,440
No. Your wound hasn't healed yet.

244
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,680
Just listen to me, and stay here and recover.

245
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,380
Jiang Jiang. The people in the rural areas of Lakaya speak French with a strong accent.

246
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,420
Jiang Jiang. The people in the rural areas of Lakaya speak French with a strong accent.

247
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,360
Jiang Jiang. The people in the rural areas of Lakaya speak French with a strong accent.

248
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,640
And some of them only speak the local dialect.

249
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,160
There's no way you'll be able to handle it alone.

250
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,900
Oh, that's right.

251
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,600
But you still can't go.

252
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,600
What if your wound becomes infected? It's too dangerous.

253
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,220
I'll bring gauze and iodine with me.

254
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,880
And if anything does happen, don’t we have the best surgeon with us?

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,040
And if anything does happen, don’t we have the best surgeon with us?

256
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,180
I'm sure it'll be fine.

257
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,240
Right, Dr. Xu is also going to the free clinic with us.

258
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
And if we leave you alone at the hospital, I also won't feel at ease.

259
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,920
Okay.

260
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,400
Is Wei'an still online?

261
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,640
She hung up long ago.

262
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,000
She seems quite busy.

263
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,120
Then did she mention where exactly she is in Lakaya?

264
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,000
I didn't ask, and I don't know why she went to such a place.

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,860
I didn't ask, and I don't know why she went to such a place.

266
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,600
Lakaya... why are they both there?

267
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,380
Lakaya... why are they both there?

268
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,280

269
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,460
 Wei'an, where are you in Lakaya?

270
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,420
 Which hospital?

271
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,560
Dr. Fang, this baguette is as hard as a rock.

272
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,660
Dr. Fang, this baguette is as hard as a rock.

273
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,000
I won't eat it anymore.

274
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,740
I should keep it for self-defense.

275
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,520
The location of the free clinic this time is very remote.

276
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,140
If you don't eat it now, there won't be anything when we get there.

277
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,960
If you don't eat it now, there won't be anything when we get there.

278
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,020
Fine.

279
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,520
Time for breakfast!

280
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,880
I know everyone is working hard for the free clinic,

281
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,020
so I asked the cafeteria auntie to make steamed buns overnight.

282
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,420
Steamed buns!

283
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,300
We have steamed buns to eat now.

284
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,860
Wait a minute.

285
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Don’t eat it yet, everyone.

286
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,780
Is there such a good thing in this world?

287
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,560
Our frugal Interpreter Su is treating everyone to a free breakfast?

288
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,200
There has to be a catch.

289
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,160
A catch?

290
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,460
If you think there's a catch, you can also give me money.

291
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,600
If you think there's a catch, you can also give me money.

292
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
One tea egg, two steamed buns, and a cup of soy milk. 20 USD isn't too much, right?

293
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,880
One tea egg, two steamed buns, and a cup of soy milk. 20 USD isn't too much, right?

294
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,960
One tea egg, two steamed buns, and a cup of soy milk. 20 USD isn't too much, right?

295
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
I knew it. This breakfast costs over 100 RMB.

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,480
You're really obsessed with money.

297
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,800
What did you say? Who's obsessed with money?

298
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
You're the one who's obsessed with money!

299
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,300
Eating can't even shut your mouth. Fang Mingfan.

300
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,040
Wei'an is kind-hearted and generous. She paid for everything herself.

301
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,960
But these steamed buns really can’t be eaten for free.

302
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,820
We should get paid for working overtime on the weekend.

303
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,920
Dr. Gu should reimburse us later.

304
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,840
Fine, you'll get reimbursed.

305
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,340
Come on.

306
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,000
Here.

307
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,020
There's no cilantro.

308
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,520
What?

309
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,000
I specially made it for you without cilantro.

310
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,260
How do you know I don't eat cilantro?

311
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,360
Last time we had hotpot, I saw you picking out the cilantro.

312
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,960
Last time we had hotpot, I saw you picking out the cilantro.

313
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,360
You're still picky, even at your age.

314
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,960
Thank you.

315
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,780
Go get some more medicine.

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,200
What's the matter?

317
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,040
Gosh, it stinks.

318
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,880
I told you to drink less water.

319
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,380
There's no way you can handle the toilet here.

320
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,360
What is it?

321
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,820
You stepped in poop?

322
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,760
- Stop laughing. Get rid of it for me! 
 - Wipe it off.

323
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,560
- Stop laughing. Get rid of it for me! 
 - Wipe it off.

324
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,120
- What's wrong? 
 - My foot.

325
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,760
Come on.

326
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,460
Sit down.

327
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,000
Be careful.

328
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,840
- Thanks. 
 - You're welcome.

329
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,740
- Sit tight. 
 - What's the matter with her?

330
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,780
Her mom hasn't been able to speak or move for three months.

331
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,421
She wants to have a doctor go to her home and treat her mom.

332
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,180
But there's no bus that goes to her house.

333
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,260
She walked for several hours to get here.

334
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,700
Please. Please save my mom.

335
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,880
I'll go with you. Don't worry.

336
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,700
Take care of it for her.

337
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,160
Dr. Gu, can you wait for me?

338
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,500
I just sprained my ankle, but I can go with you if I take it easy.

339
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,680
Forget it.

340
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,720
Don't go. You hurt your foot.

341
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
It'll already be morning when you get there.

342
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,340
No, I have to go. Dr. Gu, please wait for me.

343
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,540
Jiang Muying, you don't have to go.

344
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,880
I'll go by myself.

345
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,820
That won't do. I'll go with you.

346
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,900
But your wound...

347
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,400
It's much better now. Don't worry.

348
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,560
- Over there? 
 - Yes, just over there.

349
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,700
Be careful.

350
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,440
Mom, the doctor is here. You'll get better.

351
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,340
Look at my finger.

352
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,280
Look at his finger.

353
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,420
Try to hold my finger.

354
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,220
Hold his finger.

355
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,780
- Hold it. 
 - Hold it.

356
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,200
Based on her symptoms, I think you can make a diagnosis too.

357
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,900
Based on her symptoms, I think you can make a diagnosis too.

358
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,270
Limb paralysis and dysarthria.

359
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,180
It's probably a stroke.

360
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,320
Considering the severity, it'll probably be hard to recover.

361
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,980
Is there anyone else in your family?

362
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,640
I'll give her some medicine later.

363
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,960
Tell her to do this exercise first. Do it every day.

364
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,780
Twenty times a set.

365
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,820
Three sets a day.

366
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,340
This exercise.

367
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,180
Do it every day. Twenty times a set. Three sets a day.

368
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,540
The same goes for the legs.

369
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,960
Twenty times a set.

370
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,080
Three sets a day.

371
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,540
The same goes for the legs.

372
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,060
Twenty times a set and three sets a day.

373
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,520
There's no need to do it fast.

374
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,940
Make sure the patient's joints are fully extended.

375
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,580
You don’t have to do it fast, okay?

376
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,760
This will help your mom recover.

377
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,260
If I do this every day, will my mom recover?

378
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,980
If I do this every day, will my mom recover?

379
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,540
Come here.

380
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,780
I believe that your mom knows you haven't given up.

381
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,180
She'll also definitely keep trying.

382
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,140
Things will get better.

383
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,840
Be careful, don't step on the stones.

384
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,740
The stones are slippery. Be careful.

385
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,940
What's the matter?

386
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:50,900
I was thinking that back at the hospital, you always ask me to translate the patient's condition truthfully.

387
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,300
But why did you act differently today?

388
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,380
You knew that there's no hope of recovery, but why did you keep teaching the patient's daughter recovery essentials?

389
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,340
Instead of letting them wait to die in despair,

390
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,940
why don't we...

391
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,180
help them put up a fight?

392
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,800
Sometimes, love can create miracles.

393
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,020
What if the efforts are fruitless?

394
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,620
Is it worth it?

395
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,580
When you're with your loved ones, everything is worth it.

396
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,880
Let's find a place to hide from the rain.

397
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,380
There's a cave here.

398
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,540
Let's hide inside.

399
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,100
Hurry up.

400
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,400
What do we do now?

401
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,560
It's raining too hard.

402
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,060
We can only wait here for now.

403
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,040
We'll leave after the rain stops.

404
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
This is all we can do.

405
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,680
Is there any signal?

406
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
No.

407
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,040
If we can't get in touch with the others, what should we do?

408
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,320
Let's start a fire and dry our clothes first.

409
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,720
Is everything okay?

410
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,340
It's nothing.

411
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,940
The rain probably soaked my wound.

412
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,720
It hurts a little.

413
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
What are you doing?

414
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,380
Your wound can get easily infected like this.

415
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,900
Let me take a look.

416
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,640
There's no need.

417
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,260
I'll have Dr. Xu look at it when we get back.

418
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,620
The rainwater is so dirty.

419
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,520
The wound can easily become infected.

420
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,900
You...

421
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,200
Are you being shy?

422
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,960
What's there to be shy about?

423
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,780
Isn’t it just a doctor looking at a patient’s wound?

424
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,500
I also studied medicine, okay?

425
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,105
Then what's the big deal?

426
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:32,865
Move your hand away.

427
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,700
Su Wei'an. I can only see a tiny fraction of the gauze.

428
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,920
How am I supposed to check your wound like this?

429
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,220
I already told you that I understand my injury.

430
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,560
It's really okay.

431
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,460
Let me ask you, Su Wei'an. In your mind, am I a doctor or a man?

432
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,200
Of course...

433
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,260
Of course, you're a doctor.

434
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,840
If I'm a doctor, move your hand away.

435
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:24,920
Since you see me as a doctor, in a doctor's eyes, a patient's body is the sum of a bunch of organs.

436
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,280
There's no difference between men and women.

437
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,340
You're a man. You're...

438
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,260
In my mind, you're...

439
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,660
I'll do it myself.

440
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
See for yourself.

441
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,300
It's all soaked by the rain, and you still say it's okay.

442
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,580
Hold it there for now.

443
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,720
Let me change the dressing for you.

444
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,460
Bear with it.

445
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,860
It's done.

446
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,800
Does it hurt?

447
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,360
There you go.

448
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,100
Thank you.

449
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,240
Changing a dressing for you is like fighting a war.

450
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,100
It's very late already.

451
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,300
When in the world can we go back?

452
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,060
We can't wait any longer.

453
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,940
Please wait a little longer. There's still two more people who haven't come back yet.

454
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,140
We can't wait any longer.

455
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,440
It's raining, and the road conditions at night are dangerous.

456
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,500
What do we do? The driver says we can't wait anymore.

457
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,980
And it's dangerous driving in the rain. He wants to leave now.

458
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,240
How can we do that?

459
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,740
Boss hasn’t replied to my message yet.

460
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,800
Neither has Wei'an.

461
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Is it because there's no signal in the mountains?

462
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,260
I guess so. What should we do then?

463
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,700
Let's wait a little longer. It's okay.

464
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,000
What if Xiao Su and Xiao Gu can't find the bus when they return?

465
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,380
They'll be worried.

466
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,200
It really is dangerous at night.

467
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,480
How about this, Dr. Xu?

468
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,800
I'll stay here and wait.

469
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,660
You guys can take everyone back first, okay?

470
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,740
I'll stay here and look for them.

471
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,780
How can you do that? Your foot is injured.

472
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,660
You should go back to the hospital first.

473
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,940
How about this, Jiang Jiang? I'll wait for them here.

474
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,820
If Boss and Su Wei'an go back to the hospital, give me a call.

475
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,260
No. My foot is okay now.

476
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,160
Dr. Xu treated it for me already.

477
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,200
It was just a bump.

478
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,660
Besides, you can't look for them alone, can you? I can go with you.

479
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,940
What if we run into danger?

480
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,480
With you around, I'm not afraid.

481
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,940
Okay.

482
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,340
No. No!

483
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,580
- Go.
-  Come back!

484
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,720
Jiang Jiang, be careful.

485
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,100
The rain stopped.

486
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,440
Wonderful.

487
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,220
It just rained, and the moon came out now.

488
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,820
Want to try our luck?

489
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,980
Maybe we can find a night rainbow.

490
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,120
Of course, I do.

491
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,860
But my luck has always been bad.

492
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,660
I also had bad luck when I was a kid.

493
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:40,180
But since we're together today, two negatives might make a positive.

494
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,640
Shall we go?

495
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,080
Let's go.

496
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,340
Have you ever been to Labe Village? You seem to know it well.

497
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,120
Nope.

498
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,100
But I can listen to roads.

499
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,840
Listen to roads?

500
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,060
Sounds like you're taking chances.

501
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,660
Be careful.

502
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,560
Don't scare away our luck.

503
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:30,860
Will there really be any luck?

504
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,900
You'll find the way by following the sound of water.

505
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,297
I've looked it up online.

506
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:45,360
When the full moon is 42 degrees below the sky and the humidity is high enough,

507
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,260
you might see a night rainbow.

508
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,120
Tonight is the full moon.

509
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,180
There's also the sound of water here.

510
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
And it just rained.

511
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,860
If we keep moving forward, maybe we can really see one.

512
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
Let's go.

513
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,100
Be careful.

514
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,760
♫  Your secret  ♫

515
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,740
♫  Luckily, I was the one to hear you sleep talk  ♫

516
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,720
♫  I move closer to feel your smiling lips  ♫

517
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,280
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

518
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,460
♫  It's continuous bliss that lingers on and on  ♫

519
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,880
♫  My secret  ♫

520
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,640
♫  I've forgotten that I was lonely once  ♫

521
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,640
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

522
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,020
♫  I've longed for this scene to be our shared dream in the future  ♫

523
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,530
So this is what a night rainbow is.

524
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,970
It's not my imagination, right?

525
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:27,917
It's so beautiful.

526
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,500
Seems like when the two of us are together, our luck truly gets a lot better.

527
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,120
Some people never get the chance to see such beautiful scenery throughout their entire lives.

528
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:49,948
But for some people, they just need to look up, and the precious night rainbow is hanging there waiting for them.

529
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,820
I'll also give you a priceless treasure.

530
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,820
I just picked this up from the water.

531
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,880
Legend has it that if you take a stone picked up from the water home

532
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,820
when a night rainbow appears, the gods will take away your illness.

533
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,760
Illness?

534
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,900
An associate professor like you actually told me a fairytale.

535
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,160
Are you being serious?

536
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,800
You don't believe it?

537
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,160
If you don't,

538
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I'll just throw it away.

539
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,200
No!

540
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:24,420
Su Wei'an, are you really in such a rush to return that New Year's kiss?

541
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,880
The serious and rigid you, and the smooth-talker you…

542
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,800
Which one is the real you?

543
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,240
The serious and rigid me, or the smooth-talker me, which one do you prefer?

544
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,700
I know.

545
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,160
You like both, as long as it's me.

546
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,140
No, I don't.

547
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,700
♫  I'm waiting for the rain, waiting for the seasons to change  ♫

548
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:20,520
♫  I know you can feel my longing  ♫

549
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:28,780
♫  It's like writing your name on the sand, soon to be washed away by the moonlit waves.  ♫

550
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:35,820
♫  The moon illuminating the summer nights  ♫

551
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,420
♫  I'm waiting for the rain, waiting for the seasons to change  ♫

552
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,420
♫  How do I collect memories like fallen leaves, one at a time?  ♫

553
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,320
Su Wei'an.

554
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,540
The calm you, the crazy you,

555
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,780
or the inexplicable you,

556
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,420
I like them all.

557
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,360
Be my girlfriend.

558
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,720
 Why can't time stop at this moment?

559
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,460
 Can I have such happiness?

560
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,740
Is it so difficult to answer?

561
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,500
Answer what?

562
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,580
Tell me.

563
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,740
Tell me you like me. And that you're willing to be my girlfriend.

564
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,280
It’s not like I'm signing a consent form for emergency surgery.

565
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,260
You have to give me some time to think about it.

566
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,240

567
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,580

568
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,080
 Why are you in a hospital gown? Wei'an, where exactly are you?

569
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,260
 - I'm in Lakaya. 
 - Lakaya?

570
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,620
 Your male idol, Professor Gu, is also in Lakaya.

571
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,880
 Did you meet him?

572
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,780
Assistant Lin, book me a ticket to Lakaya for Saturday.

573
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,100

574
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,260

575
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,480
Thankfully, I didn't fail.

576
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,230

577
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,820
This is a major breakthrough!

578
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,040
We can start Phase III clinical trials now.

579
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,520
With such promising data from Phase II, I have great confidence in the Phase III experimental results now.

580
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,200
This is great, Professor Wen.

581
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,700
I thank you on behalf of all chorea patients. You've brought hope to them!

582
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,740
Don't worry, we'll recruit volunteers as soon as possible.

583
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:55,340
Also, the project was able to come this far thanks to your strong support.

584
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,660
Thank you, President Du. No, Xiao Du.

585
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,060
When you have time, come to my house for a meal.

586
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,820
Okay.

587
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,380

588
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,600

589
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,740
Wait a second.

590
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,220
What's wrong? Are you tired?

591
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,820
Are we lost?

592
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,100
We have a compass, the creek, and the stars.

593
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,560
We can definitely make it out.

594
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,260
What's that sound?

595
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,200
Su Wei'an, aren't you very brave?

596
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,680
Are you scared by such a little movement?

597
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,740
What? I didn't get scared.

598
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,000
Watch out!

599
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,660
- Are you okay? Here. 
 -  My leg.

600
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,640
Does it hurt?

601
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,240
It's okay. I probably just sprained it.

602
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,880
Then it shouldn't be a problem with the bone. You can't move around too much now.

603
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,660
How about this? Let's find a safe place to wait first. At least until dawn.

604
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,980
Okay.

605
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,420
Come on.

606
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,940
I can manage. Your wound hasn't healed yet.

607
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,320
Be careful.

608
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,320
Take it easy.

609
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,880
Slow down, Fang Mingfan. It's a mountain trial.

610
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,900
Are you scared?

611
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,800
No, I'm not.

612
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,740
And you insisted on coming.

613
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:10,000

614
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,950
