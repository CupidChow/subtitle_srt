16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,360
Before Su Wei'an came back, we were fine with each other. And as soon as she came back, you want to break up with me.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,580
If it's not because of her, then what is it?

18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,160
You peeked at my phone, didn't you?

19
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

20
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,660
When did you install such a thing on my phone?

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,200
You're spying on me.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,100
Xiao Ran,

23
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:14,140
if you feel insecure in our relationship, then I suggest you reevaluate it.

24
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,680
No, Yuncheng, I can explain it.

25
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,700
You are busy with work all the time. I didn't want to bother you.

26
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:28,720
I thought if I knew where you were, I could just show up. It's convenient.

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,900
Many couples are using the app.

28
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,660
I think it's best for us to end things.

29
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,820
Yuncheng!

30
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:48,140

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,800
 Su Wei'an, I won't lose to you.

32
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,600

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,020
Have you guys noticed that Dr. Gu is extra nice to the family of the patient in bed 12?

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,440
He sure is.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,400
Not only did he operate on the patient, but he also bustled around, helping the girl out.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,160
Who's the girl, really?

37
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,980
I've heard she was his junior sister at Huaren Medical University.

38
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,710
Dr. Wen.

39
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,300
You're here.

40
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,420
The girl wasn't just a junior sister. She was actually in my year at university.

41
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,500
Su Wei'an was a popular girl at Huaren Medical University.

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,560
Someone with a complicated past.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,780
Tell us all about it.

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,980
Back in university...

45
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,600
She's the student who reported Director He to someone in authority?

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,140
Yeah. To compete with Wen Ran for the first author position,

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,820
she not only reported her own professor but she also wrote a letter to an international medical journal.

48
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,440
Her classmate had their award revoked just like that. She's a real piece of work.

49
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,760
She and Wen Ran were best friends.

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,540
Director He was implicated and demoted half a rank.

51
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,740
Which is why he's still taking orders from Dr. Gu, who's significantly younger than him.

52
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,980
- I'm sure Director He hates her guts. 
 - Don't.

53
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,700
She's probably the worst thing that ever happened to Director He.

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,870
So why did she drop out after getting her way?

55
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,750
Who knows? Maybe she was eaten up with guilt.

56
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,300
- Yeah, she probably was. 
 - Thanks.

57
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,520
All right, let's go.

58
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,220
No. You dropped out of college?

59
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,580
- You stole someone else's work? 
 - I did not.

60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,980
How could you have not told me about it?

61
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,320
We'll talk about this later, okay?

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Have you completed the shift handover?

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,080
Dr. Gu.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,060
Auntie.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,800
Is everything okay with Miss Su Yuan? I'm going to make rounds in a bit. I'll check on her.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
I appreciate it.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,925
Dr. Gu, can I ask you something?

68
00:04:56,925 --> 00:05:02,220
My daughter went to Huaren Medical University and used to work in Huaren Hospital as an intern.

69
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,280
Have you two met before? Have you ever taught her?

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,220
Why do you ask?

71
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,420
Yeah, um, I overheard the nurses saying she got expelled for misconduct.

72
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,340
Is that true?

73
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,880
It certainly is.

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,840
Why else would she drop out?

75
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,340
She shouldn't have put her name as the first author on Wen Ran's paper.

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,720
It was a matter of principle. A grave mistake that got her kicked out of school.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
That's nonsense. I didn't do it.

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,820
Yeah, my daughter's not like that.

79
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,180
She spent the last few years studying in France, didn't you?

80
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,400
Madam, are you sure your daughter was studying in France?

81
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,640
Because I heard she was in Lakaya in the last few years.

82
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,680
Maybe it was a little white lie she told.

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,260
It wasn't the only time she lied, was it?

84
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,760
That's impossible. My daughter never lies to me.

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,680
Right? Wei'an, answer me. You didn't lie to me, or did you?

86
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,700
Dr. Gu, she grew up with an ambition to get into Huaren Medical University.

87
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,820
She just wants to be a good doctor.

88
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,700
Tell me. She was a good student, wasn't she?

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,980
That's right, Auntie.

90
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:38,600
I remember Wei'an being the brightest and most outstanding student.

91
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,460
As far as I'm concerned, she didn't do anything wrong.

92
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,420
Some, though, have a penchant for playing little games and violating ethical standards.

93
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,160
What are you insinuating? Who are you referring to?

94
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,020
Whoever took what I said personally.

95
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,460
Ah, I see what's going on. You like Su Wei'an, don't you?

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,400
That's why you're defending her.

98
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,480
And you're so protective of Wen Ran. Does it mean you have feelings for her?

99
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,040
See? I guessed it. You're so quick to defend your future son-in-law, hmm?

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,160
- You're talking absolute nonsense! 
 - Auntie. 
 - Mom.

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,020
You should control your mom.

102
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,240
My daughter has strong moral principles.

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,980
I can vouch for her.

104
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,960
As her thesis advisor, it was your fault that the authorship went wrong!

105
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,980
But since it was in the past, I'm willing to let it go.

106
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,520
Just remember this.

107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,220
From this point forward, you will not speak ill of my daughter.

108
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,540
Otherwise, as her mother, I will sue you for unethical behavior!

109
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,080
That's enough. Being loud doesn't make you right. Guessing the apple never falls far from the tree.

110
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
This is a hospital. I'd rather not stoop to your level.

111
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,620
Oh, Mom, it's okay.

112
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,320
Let's get out of here.

113
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,890
You heard what those people said in the hospital.

114
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,560
So, are you going to tell me about it? Or do I have to ask around?

115
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,780
I did drop out.

116
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,780
What about the study abroad program in France?

117
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,380
I never applied for it.

118
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,020
How could you have lied to me, Miss Grown-Up?

119
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,600
So where were you instead? Where did you go?

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,740
I thought med school was hard. I couldn't take it anymore.

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,600
So I became a backpacker and traveled around the world.

122
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,940
I took on some jobs while at it.

123
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,560
I've been to a lot of places, such as Phuket, Nice, and, uh, Morocco.

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,500
They're fun places to visit. And with beautiful sights to see.

125
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,120
Traveling is so much more enjoyable than studying.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,760
Oh, you could've told me sooner.

127
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,660
Mom, please don't scold and blame me.

128
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,800
No, I'm not.

129
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,100
I want you to live a more relaxed life just as much as you do.

130
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,500
I know medical school is difficult, but you made that choice yourself.

131
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,660
Wei'an, since you were a kid, I've been supporting your decision-making.

132
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,340
Dropping out of school was a big deal and a great embarrassment to me.

133
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,920
I didn't want to disappoint you.

134
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
You couldn't have.

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,100
I blame myself for not making enough money to provide for you.

136
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,780
You love to travel. I ought to support your passion.

137
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,300
It's a big world out there. It would be a shame not to explore it.

138
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,160
But you should've told me about your plans. You shouldn't have kept me in the dark.

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Am I an unreasonable person in your eyes?

140
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,140
No, of course not.

141
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,380
Sister Lan, those rumors about me in the hospital, let's not take them personally.

142
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,720
Oh, I won't.

143
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,140
Dr. Gu acknowledged publicly that you were brilliant, remember?

144
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,920
I call that a validation.

145
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,180
He's been really helpful. And he's always sticking up for you.

146
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,020
Are you two...

147
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,620
No. There's nothing going on between us.

148
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,180
Right. He is too good for you.

149
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,040
Can we talk about something else, please?

150
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,280

151
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,740
Dr. Gu, how is she?

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,300
The patient is stable enough to be transferred to the ward.

153
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,540
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

154
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,020
Auntie, Wei'an.

155
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,200
What are you doing here?

156
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,620
I've got Auntie a VIP room featuring the best medical equipment and the most natural light.

157
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,580
My assistant here is going to help you with the transfer process. Go and get the transfer paperwork done.

158
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,720
- All right. 
 - That's very thoughtful of you.

159
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,560
You've been a great help to me and my family.

160
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,660
Wei'an, you owe Yuncheng a big thank you.

161
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,040
Thank you, Senior Brother.

162
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,660
No problem. You could treat me to dinner to express your appreciation.

163
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,970
Yeah, of course.

164
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,580
I'll leave you guys to it.

165
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,620
That's good.

166
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Mommy, look. The lady is rotating her wrists. Are they making a video?

167
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
Like this. Look how good I am.

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,480
Stop. It's rude.

169
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,140
I'm sorry for my child's disrespectful behavior.

170
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,740
That's okay.

171
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Why are you here?

172
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,560
Auntie, here.

173
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,540
Try this.

174
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,600
Let me show you.

175
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,780
Tuck the strap through the hole and then tuck it back.

176
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,680
It'll give your hand support. There's one more.

177
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,520
Now, your other hand.

178
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,400
Repeat the same steps.

179
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,220
With the extra stability, you'll feel more comfortable. Do they fit your hand just right?

180
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
Thank you.

181
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,500
Just doing my job.

182
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,080
Thanks.

183
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,780
 Su Wei'an,

184
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,300
 if you were in Auntie Yuan's shoes, would you want to end your life?

185
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,140
Life is tough. Have something sweet.

186
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,280
What, you're afraid of being seen accepting the drink?

187
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,140
I'm just talking to the family of my patient.

188
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,340
Thanks.

189
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,480
My aunt was studying music in St. Petersburg until I was six.

190
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,760
My dad said she was the only person in their small town who became a national-level violinist.

191
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,760
It's hard to imagine, right?

192
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,410
I'll never forget the first time I saw her at the airport.

193
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,280
She walked out of the gate carrying a case. She stood out from the crowd.

194
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,265
Slim figure. High-bridged nose.

195
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,580
Knee-length body-con dress. Long, graceful neck.

196
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,540
She walked up to me and gave me a chocolate.

197
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,400
I shrank and hid behind my dad. Whispered that my aunt was a foreigner.

198
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,820
When I was a kid, I'd follow her around when she wasn't busy.

199
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,340
I'd ask her to play with me or just watch her practice violin.

200
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,400
That sounds nice.

201
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,660
At that age, that was my idea of happiness.

202
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:03,880
I used to think Auntie would stay the same.

203
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,660
That she would age gracefully.

204
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,060
What's the point of living

205
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,610
when life is so cruel?

206
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,720
Is that her thought or yours?

207
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,580
I'm sorry. I... That was my foul mood talking.

208
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
Can you just promise me something?

209
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,780
No matter how hard it gets, don't lose hope in life.

210
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,940
All right?

211
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,300
Why are you saying this?

212
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,860
I've been out here too long. I'd better go back inside to be with my aunt.

213
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,820
Su Wei'an, you said you wouldn't run away.

214
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,600
 I also want to live well.

215
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,720

216
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,200

217
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,700
 There's scarce medical literature on Huntington's Disease.

218
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,240
- Hello. 
 - Hello, Dr. Gu.

219
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
Here.

220
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,760
Can you search the index for theses and dissertations

221
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,240
on the topic "Huntington's Disease"? From all around the world, as well as the most recently published ones.

222
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
Sure.

223
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
And please send them to me by email.

224
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,840
Of course.

225
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,280
Here.

226
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,540
- All right. 
 - Thank you.

227
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,565
Autosomal inheritance... A 50% chance of passing on the disease...

228
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,700
My mom made this. She asked me to drop it off for you.

229
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
Auntie made this?

230
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,080
Why do you look reluctant?

231
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,660
That's not true. I'm thankful for your help.

232
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,340
Your mom showed her appreciation. What about you?

233
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,360
It's okay. You can repay me back later.

234
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,420

235
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,140
Aren't you a researcher for glioblastoma? Why are you reading information about Huntington's Disease?

236
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,560
Your aunt is under my care. I need to update my research knowledge in a timely manner.

237
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,380
So I can come up with a more effective treatment strategy.

238
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,200
Why? Is there a problem?

239
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,980
No.

240
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,520
I just think that you already have enough on your plate.

241
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,060
I see no reason for you to waste your time treating the untreatable.

242
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,380
I'm leaving now.

243
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,680
Dr. Wen, you're staying?

244
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,040
Yeah, I'm going to stay a little longer.

245
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,380
- All right, then. I'm off. 
 - See you tomorrow.

246
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,680
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

247
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,300

248
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,320
I've got to hand it to you, Wei'an.

249
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,900
After all these years, Yuncheng is still hung up on you.

250
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,760
 You don't have to invest in my dad's project for my sake. I'm sure his research will succeed.

251
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,120
 But I also understand that you're looking for high financial profits.

252
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,240
 My investment in Huntington's Disease research isn't just about money.

253
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,440
 Then what is it about?

254
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,260
 Wei'an, you said before that your distant relative was diagnosed with Huntington's disease.

255
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:44,300
 I didn't expect it to be your biological aunt. This isn't a distant relative anymore, it's a close relative.

256
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,140
 - Wei'an, are you— 
 - Of course not.

257
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,400
 I've taken the test.

258
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,980
 I'm negative. I don't have the disease-causing gene.

259
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,940
 Did you do the test at our Huaren Hospital? We all have electronic records now. I can help you pull it up and take a look.

260
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,660
 There's no need.

261
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,080
Could it be...

262
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,480
Xiao Ran, I really appreciate it.

263
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,980
No worries, Auntie.

264
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,740
An An, there you are.

265
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,140
Xiao Ran has scheduled an appointment for you to get genetic testing.

266
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,380
She said diagnostic tests performed at Huaren Hospital have a higher accuracy rate.

267
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,720
You can get it done today.

268
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,720
That's right. Just get your blood drawn and you're done.

269
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,400
I'd rather not trouble you with such a trivial matter.

270
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,840
An An, you might as well do it.

271
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,920
Just to put my mind at ease.

272
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,900
I will when I have time.

273
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,640
You're available now, aren't you? Auntie is already asleep.

274
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,680
Your mom can manage alone. You have nothing to do anyway.

275
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,200
Just go. For everyone's peace of mind.

276
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,360
- Yeah. Just get the test done once and ease your mom's mind. It would be worthwhile. 
 - Exactly.

277
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,080
- Go. 
 - Just go.

278
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,780
Thanks.

279
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,960
Doctor, could you make rush it for my friend?

280
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,800
Oh, and here's her toothbrush.

281
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,960
To be on the safe side, please use both the blood and saliva samples.

282
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Thank you.

283
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,380
How can you take something of mine without my permission?

284
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,720
I figured it wouldn't occur to you to bring it. DNA tests aren't 100% accurate.

285
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
It's foolproof this way.

286
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,780
All right, you're done. I'm heading off. Bye.

287
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,940
Hello, Jiang Jiang. I need your help.

288
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,300

289
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,220

290
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,080
Hi, I'm here to get a lab test result.

291
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,000
- Hang on. Let me check. 
 - Sure.

292
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,360
Someone else picked it up.

293
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,280
It was picked up? By whom?

294
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,540
Well, I haven't a clue.

295
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,660

296
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,280
 Xiao Juan, you must be tired.

297
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,120
 Senior Sister Wen Ran, hello.

298
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,540
 Yeah, I've been working extra hours in the last few days. I'm so tired.

299
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,540
 I brought you soy milk. It's still hot.

300
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,320
 That's so sweet of you, Senior Sister.

301
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,440
 A best friend of mine took a test. I came to pick up her result.

302
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,380
 Do you have the patient's power of attorney?

303
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,640
 Bad reception in the lobby again. They couldn't access the file. So here I am.

304
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,700
 That machine is a piece of junk. It's always breaking down. Has the patient come in person?

305
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,640
 She's terribly busy with her aunt's hospitalization. She didn't want to wait any longer, so she send me to help.

306
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,180
 She's my best friend from college.

307
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,110

308
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,120
Wei'an, I went to the counter to get your test result. But the staff said someone else took it.

309
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,760
Yeah.

310
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,220
I was the first to arrive. No one else was there.

311
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,380
Is it possible Wen Ran took it?

312
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,060
Oh gosh. If she shows your positive test result to your mom...

313
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,240
I'm sorry, Wei'an. I... Calm down.

314
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,700
Yeah. I have the other report in my bag.

315
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,480
Sure. All right. I'm coming right over.

316
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,940
Jiang Muying. Watch where you're going.

317
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,000
What is this?

318
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,900
Good morning, Dr. Gu.

319
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,880
Wait. What are you doing here at the lab?

320
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,840
What are you getting tested for?

321
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,140
I came to get checked out.

322
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,460
I've been having stomach pains. It's that time of the month again, you know.

323
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,900
It's not suitable to go into detail. Are you sure you want to hear more?

324
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,560
No. You take care.

325
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,400
All right, bye.

326
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,420
She said she came here for stomach pain.

327
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,600
Then why did she take genetic testing?

328
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,480
 What is this?

329
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,380
 Good morning, Dr. Gu.

330
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,000
Could it be...

331
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,580
Dr. Gu..

332
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,320
Have you ever seen him panic like that?

333
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,020
I've never seen him like that before.

334
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,260

335
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,060
Xiao Ran, I'm here. Where are you? Why did you ask me to come to the hospital?

336
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,020
Wei'an.

337
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,500
Your test results came back.

338
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,660
Xiao Ran, her test results came out? What does it say?

339
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,640
Wei'an, you tested positive. Aw, what are you going to do?

340
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,500
Wen Ran!

341
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,800
Mom.

342
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,320
It can't be...

343
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,020
It's okay, Mom. What she's saying is not true.

344
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,060
Why?

345
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,080
Wei'an's tests came back negative.

346
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,400
I have proof of that.

347
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,880
What is going on? Why are there two reports?

348
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,660
Auntie, I presented Wei'an's ID for the pick-up.

349
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,840
- Look, it says here that she's negative. She's all right. 
 - Yeah.

350
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,500
It says negative. Negative. Right?

351
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,440
You two saw this day coming and had a fake result in place?

352
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,320
Wei'an, you really shouldn't try to fool your mom with a false report.

353
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,100
Wen Ran, what is it that you want?

354
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,120
Wei'an, I know it's a bitter pill for us to swallow.

355
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,000
But as medical students, we're supposed to have faith in medical science.

356
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,540
There may be no cure at this time,

357
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,360
but with preparation, we may be able to delay the onset of symptoms.

358
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,240
Wen Ran, that's enough.

359
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,700
Jiang Muying, where did you get that report?

360
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,420
The report... I brought Wei'an's ID to the lab and collected the report there.

361
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,660
Wen Ran, what about you?

362
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,840
Did Su Wei'an send you to pick this up too?

363
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,800
No. I never asked her to do that.

364
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,140
That's odd. The hospital regulations specify that only the patient

365
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,340
or someone with their ID or a POA can have access to the patient's results.

366
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:17,420
Otherwise, it's a privacy violation. The employee will receive a warning, or worse, get fired.

367
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,060
Wen Ran, you haven't forgotten about basic medical ethics, have you?

368
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,880
I haven't.

369
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,400
Auntie, I've heard the system at the laboratory department is down today. They're working on it.

370
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,940
A lot of invalid test results were printed and have been tossed out.

371
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,500
Don't tell me you got this out of the trashcan.

372
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,040
But if you didn't,

373
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,920
that would mean you connived with someone in the department to smuggle out a copy.

374
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:07,140
If that's the case, it's a gross misconduct. I am required to report it to my superiors.

375
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,260
It was scavenged.

376
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,340
And you have the nerve to scare them with it?

377
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,380
Wen Ran, can you please stay away from Wei'an?

378
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,700
Which means Wei'an is all right. It was a mix-up, right?

379
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,280
That's right.

380
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,820
I'm so relieved.

381
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm glad it turned out okay. I'll leave you to it.

382
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
Wen Ran.

383
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,120
Yes, Dr. Gu?

384
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,000
Do not ever share anything with anyone in the hospital without proof again.

385
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,100
This was a false alarm.

386
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,780
But if something like this happens again, you will be held accountable.

387
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,640
Got it.

388
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,840
Dr. Gu, thank you so much.

389
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,220
Don't worry, Auntie. Wei'an is okay.

390
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,150
Jiang Muying!

391
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,000
Dr. Gu.

392
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:37,020
Let me ask you something. Where exactly did you get the report?

393
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,660
At the dispatch counter. I showed them Wei'an's ID.

394
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,420
Okay.

395
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,590
Then what about Wen Ran? Where did she get hers?

396
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,380
How would I know? She must have made it up.

397
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,600
You know what she's like. This wasn't the first time she'd given Wei'an a hard time.

398
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,260
Why did you tell me you were there to get checked out instead of telling me the truth?

399
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,680
It is the truth. I did get an exam.

400
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,320
If you don't believe me, take a look at my medical exam results.

401
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,140
- No... 
 - Dr. Gu,

402
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,445
you don't wish harm on Wei'an like Wen Ran does, or do you?

403
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:16,550
Of course, I don't.

404
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,370
Then why won't you believe Wei'an?

405
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,640
Let me ask you this. Did someone come in here this morning and ask you for a lab report?

406
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,940
No. Nobody came.

407
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,060
The neurosurgeon, Dr. Wen Ran?

408
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:46,820
Who? I-I don't know her. We'll never release test results to anyone without consent.

409
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,650
And they can only be picked up at the dispatch counter. Nobody came to me today to collect a report.

410
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,540
Wei'an, Dr. Gu talked to me earlier.

411
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,860
About the report.

412
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,420
I didn't tell him anything though.

413
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,760
I stuck to my story and said I brought your ID to pick up the report.

414
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,200
And that Wen Ran did that to you out of jealousy.

415
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,860
He's too smart to buy it.

416
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,080
Even if he did suspect that we faked the result, he chose to play along. Helped you cover your lie.

417
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,740
Maybe he doesn't care if you have the disease.

418
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,680
It doesn't make any difference to me what he thinks.

419
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,160
Wei'an, aren't you tired of acting tough?

420
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,240
You know, I feel despair, knowing I have Huntington's disease.

421
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,980
Even if he can accept me for who I am now, we don't know what the future holds for us.

422
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,600
Hypothetical and actual situations are very different.

423
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,740
I'm the 3rd generation in my paternal family to have the disease.

424
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:16,860
At the very worst, my memory will start to decline before I turn 30.

425
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,420
And then I'll lose my mobility. Move uncontrollably until I die.

426
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,340
Stop it, Wei'an.

427
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,200
Which is why I'd rather not start a relationship.

428
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,600
I don't care what others think.

429
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,760
I will be there for you. I won't leave your side no matter what you become.

430
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,480
Let's go.

431
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,060
Su Wei'an, get in the car.

432
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,280
What do you want?

433
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,740
Get in the car.

434
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,640
No.

435
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,840
What are you doing?

436
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,780
Get in the car.

437
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,440
Don't you have anything to say to me?

438
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,300
I never thought I'd live to see the day when I see you acting like a child in public, Professor Gu.

439
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,840
There's a more childish and shameless side of me.

440
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Want me to show you?

441
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,860
So...

442
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,100
having Huntington's Disease is the reason why you quit college and left without saying goodbye?

443
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,700
Let me tell you something.

444
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,680
I don't care at all if you faked your test result.

445
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,300
Are you still going to avoid me like you did before?

446
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,560
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

447
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,600
My leaving had nothing to do with the disease.

448
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,880
It was because it felt like the spark was gone.

449
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,600
Gone?

450
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,740
Then what about all those things we've been through together? What we had? What does it mean to you?

451
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,120
Was it all an act?

452
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,880
Yes.

453
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,440
It was a moment of impulse.

454
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,480
There's nothing good about being in a relationship.

455
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,360
In a relationship, you always have to consider the other person's feelings.

456
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,300
Making money is better.

457
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,520
As long as I have money, I can be happy.

458
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,060
Professor Gu, I don't need love in my life.

459
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,740
I don't want someone irrelevant to care about me.

460
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,080
Someone irrelevant?

461
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,400
That's what I am to you?

462
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,400
Great, Su Wei'an.

463
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,100
Just great.

464
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Guess I'll just update your family on your condition. Let those relevant to you care about you.

465
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,000
Are you threatening me?

466
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,680
Stop the car.

467
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,600
I said stop the car.

468
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,280
Su Wei'an.

469
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,640
Su Wei'an.

470
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,620
Su Wei'an, I didn't mean it like that.

471
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,320
I'm sorry.

472
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,860
Anyway,

473
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,740
thanks for taking care of my aunt.

474
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,620
You... Can't you say something else?

475
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,220
I don't want to hear "thank you."

476
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:46,736
I think Dr. Li is a nice girl.

477
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,740
Yeah, she is.

478
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,320
But it doesn't mean I have to be with her.

479
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,800
I think you're nice too. Why won't you be with me?

480
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,740
That's lame.

481
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Li Wantong is perfect.

482
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,686
Born rich. Well-educated. Pretty. She has it all.

483
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:25,500
And the best thing about her is that she's not afraid to tell me her feelings.

484
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,140
She doesn't hide them from me. Unlike some escapist...

485
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,500
Will you leave this escapist alone?

486
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Dr. Li is too good to be true. It would be a happy ending if you two got together.

487
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
Let go of me.

488
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,220
She may be a perfect girl, but I don't have or want any relationship with her.

489
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,840
I don't have any relationship with you either.

490
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:11,050

491
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,980
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen

499
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:57,200
