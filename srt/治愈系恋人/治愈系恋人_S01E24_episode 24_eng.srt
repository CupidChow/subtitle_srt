00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,160
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,420
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,980

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,980

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,840
That's all for my lecture for today.

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
Thank you, everyone.

19
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,340
Thank you, Professor Wen.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,620
Next, let's invite Professor Tang Guochun from Southeast Asia Medical University to give his presentation.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,600
- Please. 
 - Don't worry.

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,400
- Su Wei'an, are you done with that? 
 - What are you doing?

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Do you hate me so much that you have to ruin my father's speech at such a high-level event?

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,140
Do you know this project not only has my father's decade of hard work but also Yuncheng's full financial backing?

25
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,420
I just don't get it. You are also a chorea gene carrier.

26
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,260
If my father's drug can successfully reach the market, wouldn't that benefit you, too?

27
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,033
Or is it that just to oppose me, you'd rather harm others without benefiting yourself?

28
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,610
Wen Ran, not everything in this world is related to you.

29
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:39,200
I never target anyone, but scientific research must stay rigorous and constant...

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,240
Scientific research?

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,960
Does it have anything to do with you?

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,620
You are a dropout, barely finishing your studies.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
How much do you really know about chorea?

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,380
What qualifications do you have to question my father's results from over a decade of painstaking research?

35
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:04,040
Dr. Wen, objectively existing adverse events severely impact patients' quality of life.

36
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,280
Although currently, in our country, there are only 30,000 chorea patients,

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,820
however small the group may be, they should not be neglected.

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,100
But do you know how much Yuncheng...

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,814
Su Wei'an! I'm not finished yet!

40
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,800
Professor Wen.

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,460
- Dad. 
 - Ran Ran.

42
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,360
What are you trying to do?

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,240
Are you determined to make those chorea patients lose their only hope?

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,040
I look forward to this hope more than anyone, but first of all, it should be a real hope.

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,040
Looks like you two have more questions, right? Go ahead.

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,840
I want to tell you, Professor Wen, that no matter when and under what circumstances

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,840
those informed consent forms to voluntarily withdraw were signed, we have sufficient evidence to prove

48
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,440
that those three patients suffered a rupture of aneurysms during the period of the drug trial.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,680
The drug trial protocol clearly states that regardless of whether an adverse event is caused by the drug,

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,300
any serious adverse event occurring during the trial period must be reported immediately.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:12,260
But you should know that the new drug can alleviate 30%
to 50% of symptoms for most patients.

52
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,600
No serious adverse events were found in Phase I or Phase II trials either.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
The trial has reached the stipulated 300 sample size,

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,960
and the probability of aneurysm rupture did not even exceed one percent, right?

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,440
So, the cases you mentioned cannot prove anything.

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,580
So what you mean is, we have to wait until another patient experiences an aneurysm rupture

57
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,720
and wait until this ridiculous probability exceeds one percent before we can prove the problem?

58
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,540
That's not what I meant. How do you not understand?

59
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,400
What are your qualifications?

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,780
Who are you to question a top-notch research team and the scientific achievements from their 15 years of hard work?

61
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,860
Questioning is fine, but you need to provide scientific evidence, right?

62
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,540
If scientific research were so easy, then how could Huntington's Disease still be an unsolved medical problem worldwide?

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,420
Professor Wen, of course, I wouldn't dare question your team's research capabilities.

64
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,240
What I'm questioning is your scientific spirit and ethical principles of drug trials.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,880
If I find scientific evidence, what will you do then?

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,060
If you do, I will stop the trial immediately and make a public apology.

67
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,120
It's a deal.

68
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,960
Dad!

69
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,780
It's a deal.

70
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,620
Wenbin, I'm waiting for your explanation.

71
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,260
Professor, I assure you that all of my actions comply with the ethical principles of drug trials.

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,240
They voluntarily signed their informed consent forms. Lawyers were present throughout the entire process.

73
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,950
I did not coerce or threaten them whatsoever.

74
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,060
Professor,

75
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,990
the deceased patient's remains had already been cremated then,

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,300
so there's no way to prove his cause of death was an adverse event due to the investigational drug.

77
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:25,740
When I get back, I will personally conduct exclusion research on the correlation between aneurysms and the drug.

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,280
Wenbin,

79
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,440
notify everyone to arrange comprehensive examinations for all trial participants as soon as possible.

80
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,220
Hello, President Du.

81
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,820
You...

82
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,240
You asked me to be a research assistant in your team. Is the offer still valid?

83
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,040
What's wrong?

84
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,220
Professor Wen asked me to prove the direct relationship between aneurysms and HDQ39.

85
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,400
I can only go back to the lab to prove it to them.

86
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,940
Wei'an, you have to think this through carefully.

87
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,160
This is not just applying for a job, not just staying with us for a while.

88
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,480
Because a lab is not a place where you can just come and go as you please.

89
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,560
I know.

90
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,760
It's not just because of Professor Wen either.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,390
I'm just thinking back to the past

92
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,580
when I would get upset over contaminated culture dishes

93
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,773
or angry enough to smash the computer over wrong data,

94
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:18,600
but as long as I saw my hard work finally saved into a PDF file,

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,980
with the "final version" added to the title,

96
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,040
that sense of accomplishment was incomparable.

97
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,340
But later on...

98
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,280
Wei'an, you made the right decision.

99
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,460
You don't need to worry about

100
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,020
chorea ruining your work before you can make any research discoveries,

101
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,000
because that's the worst-case scenario.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Nothing could be worse than that.

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,400
So, as long as you try, you won't have any regrets.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,160
But with a difficult problem like Huntington's Disease,

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,400
every small step I take, there's a voice reminding me

106
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,100
that I still have 99,999 steps left to go.

107
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,040
Did you see Professor Wen's arrogant attitude?

108
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you want to put your hopes in the hands of someone like him?

109
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,480
You're right.

110
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,460
More than the despair of not accomplishing anything,

111
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,760
I'm more afraid of not having tried at all.

112
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,240
I've decided.

113
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm going to apply to be a research assistant and go back to the lab to prove it to them.

114
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,840
Wei'an, we'll walk this path together.

115
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,500
No matter how long it can last, let's just keep going.

116
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,180
Did you guys see this job posting? The starting salary is ¥10,000  ($1,410)  a month!

117
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,020
Professor Gu's team is hiring.

118
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,760
Professor Gu must have some new research project he's working on.

119
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,040
Let me tell you.

120
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,720
Professor Gu's research on gliomas is top-level nationally.

121
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,400
If we could get into his lab team, we'd certainly publish authoritative papers in the future.

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,020
Why, looking to share in the fruits of victory?

123
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,620
Stop dreaming. Take a closer look.

124
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,160
They're hiring a research assistant. The position is so low.

125
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,840
It's obviously just a lab grunt doing chores full-time.

126
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,100
No matter how high the salary, there's no future in it.

127
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,860
In my opinion, clinical practice is still the way to go.

128
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,340
Yeah, a research assistant has low prestige and works long hours.

129
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,880
We doctors are run ragged in the wards as it is. We have no other energy for anything else.

130
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,560
It is better to leave these opportunities to new master's graduates.

131
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,080
With Professor Gu's reputation and generous salary, they'll have no trouble attracting people.

132
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah. That makes sense.

133
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,280

134
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440

135
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,700

136
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,700
This is Master's and Ph.D. textbook material. Can you even understand it?

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,120
Are you trying to cram all the knowledge in your head and compete for the position of a research assistant in the lab?

138
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,800
Are you trying to cram all the knowledge in your head and compete for the position of a research assistant in the lab?

139
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Su Wei'an, let me give you a friendly reminder, face reality.

140
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,760
Su Wei'an, let me give you a friendly reminder, face reality.

141
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,120
With your bachelor's degree and no relevant work experience, what makes you dare dream of joining Huaren Hospital?

142
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,940
Thanks for reminding me to work harder.

143
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,540
Can you give the book back to me?

144
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,820
Sorry, I'm taking this book.

145
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,380
By the way, I signed up for the position of research assistant, too.

146
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,100
I thought you got your Ph.D. Why aren't you going to clinical...

147
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,640
You're doing this just to compete with me?

148
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
How could that be?

149
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,060
You're just afraid of me, aren't you?

150
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:01,120
Afraid I'll outcompete you, afraid no matter how hard you try, it'll be in vain.

151
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,980
I'm not finished yet.

152
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,160
Su Wei'an, I really didn't expect you to be such a flirt, even in the academic field.

153
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,820
You stole my boyfriend, yet you're still ambiguous with Professor Gu.

154
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,920
What?

155
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,060
Do you want to use Professor Gu to get into the lab?

156
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,180
You're so calculating.

157
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,940
Does Yuncheng know what you're really like?

158
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,460
What's wrong with you?

159
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,700
This is the library.

160
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,980
Why are you in such a hurry to smear me?

161
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,780
Are you afraid you'll have no excuse after losing to me?

162
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,800
Do you think I will lose to you?

163
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,160
Even if you're talented, you've still fallen behind in recent years while I've kept progressing.

164
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,460
Let's just wait and see who wins and who loses.

165
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,800
Miss, I want to check out all these books.

166
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,920
All right.

167
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,220
This person was expelled from our school for plagiarizing a paper.

168
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,920
Please check her ID carefully to see if she has the qualifications to enter our Huaren Library.

169
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,260
Your books. I've checked them out.

170
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,660
This is yours. Your card has expired.

171
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,160

172
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,640
Where can I get such professional books?

173
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,100
What are you doing here?

174
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,800
Get in the car.

175
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,820

176
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,720
Wei'an, is your resume ready? I can help you hand it in.

177
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,460
I've already submitted it to the public recruitment email address.

178
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't need you to do that for me.

179
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,720
I have to open the door to the lab with my own efforts.

180
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
How confident!

181
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,400
You're worthy to be my girlfriend.

182
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,520
Of course.

183
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,220
Now that I've made up my mind, I should return to the lab openly and honorably.

184
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,720
Actually, in such a short time, it's unrealistic to systematically improve your theoretical knowledge.

185
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,240
Actually, in such a short time, it's unrealistic to systematically improve your theoretical knowledge.

186
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,600
The research assistant position emphasizes practical experience more.

187
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,020
Wei'an, you might have to work very hard in the coming days.

188
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,360
You should be prepared for that.

189
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,300
Don't worry.

190
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll enjoy my hardship.

191
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,620
What brought you here?

192
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,740
When was Su Wei'an here last time?

193
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,760
Wei'an? More than a week ago. Isn't she preparing for an exam?

194
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,340
An exam?

195
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,520
You don't know?

196
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,240
She wants to get into Huaren's lab as a researcher.

197
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,800
To get in there, she has to pass an exam. So recently she's been busy preparing for it.

198
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,880
You know the head of that lab. Gu Yunzheng! Come on.

199
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,900
If he just directly hires Wei'an, wouldn't that be easy? Why bother with an exam? It's totally unnecessary.

200
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,580
Boss.

201
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,160
Senior Brother, is this the place you want to take me to?

202
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,460
Here, give me a hand.

203
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,980
One, two, three!

204
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,380

205
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,700
Your new lab?

206
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,840
Yeah.

207
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,020
Cheng'an Laboratory.

208
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,180
Wei'an, this lab is a gift for you.

209
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,420
- For me? 
 - Yes.

210
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,500
Why?

211
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,860
I know that deep down, that small flame of yours never went out.

212
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,020
You've always wanted to return to medicine.

213
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,880
I'm willing to use my abilities to help you.

214
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,240
This lab was just built with Jiehui's latest investment.

215
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
Starting now, you're the head of this place.

216
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Any project you want to do, you can do it here.

217
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,420
I'll provide you with the best equipment and staff.

218
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,600
Senior Brother, thank you for your kind offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept it.

219
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,740
With Jiehui's capabilities, you could easily search globally for someone much more qualified to head this lab.

220
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,000
That person should not be me.

221
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
It's okay.

222
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,480
I can fund you to pursue further studies.

223
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,600
Or I can hire top talents to assist you. These are not issues at all.

224
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,700
No, I'm not being polite.

225
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,720
I'm serious.

226
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm not capable of shouldering such an enormous undertaking.

227
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,820
I don't get it.

228
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,920
If you join Jiehui, you can work with the most outstanding team.

229
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:49,220
Even if you just hold an unimportant managerial position here,

230
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,980
you'd still have a greater sense of accomplishment than being a research assistant.

231
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,820
Even though it's just a lowly research assistant position, it's still something within my capabilities right now.

232
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,740
I've already promised Gu Yunzheng that I'll go to his lab and help him out.

233
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,780
We are a couple now.

234
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:21,987
Wei'an,

235
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,130
I've put in so much effort for you. Can't you understand my feelings for you?

236
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,490
Senior Brother, I think there's a misunderstanding between us.

237
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:48,180
I've always seen you as my senior brother, nothing more.

238
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,980
If there's nothing else, I should get going.

239
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,420
Welcome, Miss Su, to visit us.

240
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,720
Why? It's not my first time here.

241
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,010
Why are you acting all mysteriously?

242
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,340
These, too, are for you.

243
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,680
I got this style, especially for you. Aren't they cute?

244
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,100
They're cute but just a little too pink.

245
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,280
What's wrong with pink? Don't girls all like pink?

246
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,800
Here.

247
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,780
Are they new?

248
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,440
Yeah.

249
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,400
Over there.

250
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,140
Did you buy all these?

251
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,980
Your taste is even worse than my mom's.

252
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,660
Why? Aren't they cute to you?

253
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,040
Not as cute as you.

254
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,280
Spit it. What have you got up your sleeve?

255
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,470
You're applying to be a research assistant. It's a lot, and time is tight.

256
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,540
I can't give you special treatment.

257
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,940
All I can do for you is provide private tutoring services.

258
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,060
Look, this is all the material I've prepared for you.

259
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,920
Although it's not super comprehensive, along with the papers I've helped summarize for you,

260
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,400
getting the assistant job is pretty much guaranteed.

261
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,440
You've prepared so thoroughly.

262
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,860
Professor Gu, you've been planning this for a while.

263
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,137
I just think your home is too far from school.

264
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:09,444
With you commuting like this every day, won't it affect your study progress?

265
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,680
Also, going home too late will disrupt Sister Lan's sleep, right?

266
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,440
This is much better. Yunzheng Coffee Library,

267
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,520
a private space just for you with personal service is open 24 hours for your use.

268
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,280
That is your tip. Get me a cup of coffee.

269
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,200
Your little tip is not enough for my coffee.

270
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,640
That's more like it.

271
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Wei'an, you're busy studying, and I'm busy with work.

272
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,180
If there's anything else, we might not even see each other once a week.

273
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,420
We finally got together after so much difficulty.

274
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,880
Starting today, I want to see you every day.

275
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,180
Okay.

276
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,400
Then I will...

277
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,960
consider it.

278
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,320
Consider it well.

279
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,220
 Please open the door.

280
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,660
What?

281
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,940
Wei'an, did you move everything over?

282
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,380
Yeah.

283
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,860
Come here.

284
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,760
What?

285
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,860
Too much stuff? Or do you regret it now?

286
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,740
I'll never regret it. Not too much stuff.

287
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,400
I used to feel like my home was too empty, so it's good to fill it up a bit.

288
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,060
So, are you not leaving tonight?

289
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,740
The hospital is closer to your place, so it's more convenient for work.

290
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,880
I can just go back home on the weekends from now on.

291
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,640
Then how did you talk to Sister Lan about you moving in with me?

292
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,700
I told her it was too busy in the lab, so the hospital arranged dorms for us.

293
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,300
I just didn't mention that this dorm is super luxurious,

294
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,540
and it also comes with 24-hour personal service.

295
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,880
♫  Forgotten conversations, every word filled with innocence  ♫

296
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,240
♫  My eyes fall on the lingering warmth of your palm  ♫

297
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,160
♫  Occasionally my heart is racing fast, feeling unsettle from a nightmare   ♫

298
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,320
♫  Forgive me for relying too much  ♫

299
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,940
♫  Your secret  ♫

300
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,820
♫  I was able to hear you sleep talk while you dream  ♫

301
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:02,300
♫  With a smile, I'm secretly writing down all your wishes  ♫

302
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
♫  My secret  ♫

303
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,720
♫  I've forgotten that I was so alone  ♫

304
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:18,000
♫  I'm hoping in the future, you'd still be tugging on the corner of my sleeves  ♫

305
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,740
♫  I'm loving you  ♫

306
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,460

307
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,160

308
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
You are going home with nothing anyway. Why are you in such a rush?

309
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,960
If you had this kind of motivation earlier, you wouldn't only have a bachelor's degree at this point.

310
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,940
Who is she talking about? Who only has a bachelor's degree?

311
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,720
Doesn't Huaren screen resume?

312
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,420
People with just a bachelor's degree can still interview?

313
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,320
The job is not specially arranged just for certain people, is it?

314
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,440
How unlucky!

315
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,940
The initial interview starts now. Come in when I call your name.

316
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,820
Li Yufang.

317
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,560
Come with me.

318
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,820

319
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,000

320
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,400

321
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,020

322
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,660

323
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,780
Dear examiners and teachers, my name is Su Wei'an.

324
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,020
I graduated from Huaren Medical University.

325
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,420
I received the national scholarship for three consecutive years.

326
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,900
I was the top student in my major for six consecutive years.

327
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,980
Since you dropped out of school, why do you want to work in a lab as a research assistant again?

328
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,680
Since you dropped out of school, why do you want to work in a lab as a research assistant again?

329
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,648
Because my aunt and her two friends

330
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:08,940
with Huntington's Disease participated in a drug trial, and they all had ruptured aneurysms.

331
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,880
However, the drug company denied that these adverse events were caused by their drug.

332
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,000
So, I want to find evidence to show them and prevent the remaining participants from encountering such dangerous events.

333
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,020
You're that female student who asked questions at the neurology conference.

334
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,060
I heard that you made Professor Wen from Zhang He Hospital embarrassed on the stage.

335
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,180
I did ask several more questions.

336
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,960
That's because I thought Professor Wen's explanation of the adverse events was unclear,

337
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,600
and academic conferences are for exchanging ideas and discussions anyway.

338
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:51,660
So, you wanted to use our department as a stepping stone to get justice for your aunt, right?

339
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,600
No. I wanted to show them that research should be done properly.

340
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,280
Even if my desire to get results is a hundred times stronger than theirs,

341
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,520
I would never accomplish it by sacrificing safety and authenticity.

342
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,640
Next time, when you confront famous professors from other hospitals,

343
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,660
remember to bring solid evidence you've found.

344
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,700
Did I pass the interview?

345
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:29,020
Let's see if you can pass the second round of interviews.

346
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Thank you, Professor Wang!

347
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,500

348
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,080

349
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,720
Didn't I ask you to wait at home?

350
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,520
After all, I'm interviewing for your research team, and we should avoid any contact in public.

351
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,700
I'm not afraid of that. You are the one that's afraid.

352
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,380
I just wanted to be the first to confirm the good news.

353
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,300
Looks like, you are sure of success.

354
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,400
That's hard to say.

355
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,480
I was fine with thinking on my feet, but you know my academic pedigree isn't an advantage.

356
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,760
It's okay.

357
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Just prepare well for the second interview. The first one is just to get first impressions.

358
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,700
The second one is what really matters. It tests your practical abilities.

359
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,260
Is Professor Wang Huanzhong still the main interviewer for the second one?

360
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
You'd better be careful.

361
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,920
Professor Wang Huanzhong doesn't tolerate the slightest flaw.

362
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,180
You can experience it for yourself

363
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,220
his death stares during the interview.

364
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,400
Death stares?

365
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,260
Get in the car.

366
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,100
Slippers, Jiang Jiang.

367
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,100
Sorry, Jiang Jiang. It's a bit messy in my home.

368
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,880
Flattie!

369
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,260
No. Your place is better than I thought.

370
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,140
Let me clean up a bit. You can sit down for a bit.

371
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,860
All right.

372
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,740
It's so awesome to live alone.

373
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,560
You can do whatever you want. Put your clothes anywhere you like.

374
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,540
If I did that, my parents would definitely scold me.

375
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,780
You came out so late. Won't your parents be worried?

376
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,260
No. I've talked to them about it.

377
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,020
That's good.

378
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,300
Are you not going to ask me what I said to them?

379
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,980
What did you say?

380
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,300
I said I already have a boyfriend now, and he will take good care of me.

381
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,500
Of course.

382
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,060
I will send you home no matter how late it gets.

383
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,080
Fang Mingfan.

384
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,820
Don't you think Dr. Gu and Wei'an's relationship has progressed in a rapid manner since they became official?

385
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,780
We're both falling behind.

386
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,020
Are you stressed about the progress of our relationship?

387
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,380
It's not a competition.

388
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,300
Your boss and Su Wei'an are moving in together. Are you still unhurried?

389
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,500
It's their own business. Why should I rush?

390
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,880
Fang Mingfan, you're so busy and come home so late every night.

391
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,140
Flattie must feel lonely, right?

392
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,120
Not at all.

393
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,300
Cats are naturally solitary animals, and Flattie doesn't like it when we foolish humans cling to them.

394
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,220
Am I right, Flattie?

395
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,100
That won't do. Flattie needs people to take care of it.

396
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,740
When you're not home, I can take care of it.

397
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,140
- Really? 
 - Yes.

398
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,800
That's great. I can give you my key.

399
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,100
Remember to lock the door when you leave.

400
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,020
What's wrong, Jiang Jiang?

401
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,600
Fang Mingfan!

402
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,840
You deserve to be single!

403
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,100
Is it that my hints weren't clear enough, or is it because I'm not charming?

404
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm a girl, after all.

405
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,140
When it comes to staying over,

406
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,640
do you want me to be more direct with you?

407
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,600
Stay over?

408
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,680
You want to stay the night here?

409
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,060
Wait, Jiang Jiang. I just think that your home is very nice.

410
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,540
You would be suffering a grievance by staying over.

411
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,680
Why would I be suffering a grievance? I won't feel that way, Fang Mingfan!

412
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,620
I've always lived with my parents since I was little, and I commuted to college from home.

413
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,620
I've never experienced the kind of alone time you have.

414
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,860
Your place, even though not very big, is so carefree.

415
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,620
Doing whatever you want every day, going to bed whenever you want,

416
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,440
ordering takeout, and having late-night snacks, which sound like a blast!

417
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,280
And the best part

418
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,580
is being able to stay with you and Flattie.

419
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,740
How wonderful!

420
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,300
You really think so?

421
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,900
Yes.

422
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,240
All right.

423
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,940
Do you know what the next step is?

424
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,000
Subculture of nerve cells.

425
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,120
My answer is the same as Su Wei'an's.

426
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,220
Can you explain the digestion steps for the subculturing of glial cells?

427
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,160
The digestion steps for the subculturing of glial cells require a 1:1 ratio.

428
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:47,780
Add 0.125% trypsin and

429
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,557
0.02% EDTA. It is advisable to cover the bottom of the bottle evenly.

430
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,740
Do you have anything to add to her answer?

431
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,600
Maintain a pH value of 7.5 and a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.

432
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,880
You may start.

433
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,120
All right. Finished.

434
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,360
Thanks, Director Wang.

435
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,120
Does anyone else need to use this?

436
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,700
No more.

437
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,280
I've finished. I'll wait for you at the cafe by the hospital gate.

438
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,160
Sneak attacking me? It's a little childish for your age.

439
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,740
We're openly and honestly in a relationship, but you make it sound like we're having an affair.

440
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,260
Because we're at the hospital.

441
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,960
Last time, at the first interview, someone said that this position was set up for me.

442
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,020
I don't want them to say you're favoring me for personal reasons.

443
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,540
Personal reasons?

444
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:38,105
All right.

445
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,038
Su Wei'an, let me tell you,

446
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:47,000
no matter what we do, those gossipmongers will always find something to gossip about.

447
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,660
As for you, you should give me more chances to favor you a bit.

448
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,500
No way. Guess what?

449
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,080
I finally got to experience Professor Wang Huanzhong's "death stares" today.

450
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,640
Huh?

451
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,640
How did that happen? Did you make mistakes in your operations?

452
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,924
No! At the end of the experiment,

453
00:38:08,924 --> 00:38:13,760
I turned off the UV lamp, and then he turned around and gave me a quick look. I was so startled.

454
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,980
I asked if someone else needed it, but he said no.

455
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,800
Wei'an...

456
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,700
I mentioned Professor Wang's death stares to help you pay attention to his strictness.

457
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,440
I didn't want you to be scared of him.

458
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
Don't worry.

459
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,660
Professor Wang looked at you, meaning he acknowledged you.

460
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,360
Really?

461
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,080
To celebrate you passing your second interview.

462
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,400
More books?

463
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,120
You passed the interview, and now you can read entertaining books.

464
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,360
Aren't you happy?

465
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,280
That's nonsense.

466
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,900
I passed, yet I still have to read. Read by yourself!

467
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,340

468
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,660
 In the world of medicine, we have to face all sorts of possibilities.

469
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,434
 We're attracted to this imperfect science

470
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:13,120
 because the moment we're obsessed with bringing the dying back to life,

471
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,460
 we grab every minute of each second of our knowledge and use our ability

472
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,940
 to change a person's life's destiny and to make it better.

473
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,100
 How old-fashioned! The libraries are even all electronic.

474
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,260
 How is there a handwritten library card?

475
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,130

476
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,120

477
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,060

478
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,640

479
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,780

480
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,010

481
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,340
You dropout student, full of useless information in your brain.

482
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,640
You scare me. How come you walk so silently?

483
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,860
You were acting so mysterious, I thought you were studying
some profound theory.

484
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,290
Turns out you are doing this.

485
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,300
I'm writing our names on the card. Is that illegal?

486
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,740
No, but it's a waste of time.

487
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,100
How is that a waste of time?

488
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,440
This way, our names will be kept in the library forever.

489
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,360

490
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,240

491
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,530
 Is Su Wei'an trying to cram knowledge?

492
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:11,560
 Isn't it too late for her to study now?

493
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,120
All right, you can go now.

494
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,740
Thank you.

495
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Wait, Miss. Please don't put them back yet.

496
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,500
I want to borrow these books.

497
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,980

498
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,860

499
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,620
Gu Yunzheng, Su Wei'an.

500
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Xiao Ran, welcome! But why bring so many gifts?

501
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,360
You are really too polite.

502
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,780
Auntie, my friend brought all these from France.

503
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,440
They are high-end customized skincare products. You must give them a try.

504
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,200
If you like them, I'll buy more for you later.

505
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,700
Thank you! Have a seat!

506
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,600
As long as you visit me, I'm happier than ever.

507
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,760
When I'm happy, I feel 10 years younger.

508
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,540
This is more effective than any skincare product.

509
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,120
Have some tea.

510
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:10,990

511
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,020
 'Lost' - Zhou Shen
