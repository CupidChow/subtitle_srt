 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuo Xuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,160
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,900
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,480
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,390
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,640
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,060
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,220
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her amidst the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,280
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,380
♫  Even though you know life is filled with regrets  ♫

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:24,000
♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,380

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,980

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,885
Even if I have to work all night tonight, I'll make sure to finish translating all these materials

17
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:47,620
and then make a clean break with you.

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,520
Senior? What are you doing here?

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,860
You said you're working overtime,

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,960
so I thought you must be hungry. I brought you some food.

21
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you, Senior.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,420
Fried chicken!

23
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you have to finish translating all these documents tonight?

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Yes.

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,420
The sooner I finish, the sooner I can break free from Exploitative Gu.

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,020
I must finish it all tonight.

27
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,680
Let me help you.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,960
No need.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,100
How can I trouble President Du with my little part-time job?

30
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,680
I get your point.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,660
You think I can't help you because I don't know French, right?

32
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,140
Did I make it that obvious?

33
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,980
Even though I don't understand French, I can still help you proofread documents and staple them, or something.

34
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,840
Anyway, it's definitely faster than you doing it alone.

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,760
Do you remember back when we stayed up all night working on experiments together?

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,240
Speaking of which, I actually quite miss those old days.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,700
Rather than saying it's you bothering me,

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,980
it's more like you're taking me back to our university days, and letting me feel young again.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,280
Okay. Thanks in advance then, Senior.

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
We don't need to be so polite.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,660
Come on. Let's see if we can still work together

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,240
as perfectly as we did before.

43
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,140
This is what you asked me to translate yesterday.

44
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,560
I'm finished. Please check it and confirm.

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,940
So fast?

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,500
Are you sure you're not trying to deceive me?

47
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,980
You can check it as you wish.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,820
How's this possible? This isn't a task that can be finished in just one night.

49
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,620
Yesterday, Senior stayed up all night with me and helped me finish it.

50
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,580
Du Yuncheng?

51
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,280
You did the translation with him?

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,620
So you two stayed in the lab all night?

53
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,720
Yes. Is there a problem?

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,700
Su Wei'an, I let you return to the lab

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,680
because I wanted you to work, not to date inside of it.

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,800
Who gave you permission to let an outsider into my lab?

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
Who's dating in the lab? Can you not talk nonsense?

58
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,720
I told you before. Without my permission, no one is allowed into my lab.

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,520
Are you ignoring what I say?

60
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,540
Come on, man. Can you be reasonable?

61
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,160
I helped you translate materials, yet I still get scolded by you.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,940
If Du Yuncheng is an outsider, then I'm even more so.

63
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,700
If you're in a bad mood, go scold someone else. Find someone who upsets you.

64
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,820
Why are you losing your temper with me?

65
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm not losing my temper with you.

66
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,260
Never mind, I don't care.

67
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,380
Anyway, my translation work is done.

68
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,180
Please check it immediately and give me the final payment.

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,940
Starting today, I don't need to come to work anymore.

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,900
And, even more so, I don't need to accept your oppression anymore.

71
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,440
You don't have to go to the lab to work today?

72
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,040
I worked all night yesterday.

73
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
Do you want me to work myself to death?

74
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,480
I was just asking.

75
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,700
What? Are you angry? Are you having your period?

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,900
I think Gu Yunzheng is having his period.

77
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,520

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,700
So much money?

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,700

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,920
I think he can have his period more often.

81
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,940
Miss Su.

82
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,100
An? What are you doing here?

83
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,500
You... You two...

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,160
This is my current and only boyfriend.

85
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,620
This is my current and only boyfriend.

86
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,200
He's your current and only boyfriend?

87
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,240
What about Gu Yunzheng?

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,140
Dr. Gu...

89
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,560
He doesn't really count as an ex-boyfriend.

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,520
He's more like a missed target, I guess.

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,080
So, Dr. Gu rejected you?

92
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Yes, he did.

93
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,580
But he can be seen as the first failure I've ever encountered in life.

94
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,820
My darling, you're gorgeous.

95
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,080
We'll get going then.

96
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,000
What's all this about?

97
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,720
It turns out Gu Yunzheng didn't have a change of heart.

98
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,580
He's always had you in his heart.

99
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,560
Then has he been acting all this time?

100
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,180
But why would he do that?

101
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,100
 There's a herbal restaurant that opened near the hospital.

102
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,900
 I just took my girlfriend to try it, and I brought some back.

103
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,140
 Do you want to try some of this soup?

104
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,980
 Are you sure this is leftover food?

105
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,363
 Interpreter Su, please open it and try some.

106
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:41,180
 If it tastes good, tell me. I want to give it to my girlfriend.

107
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,960
 Dr. Gu, I'm your translator, not a guinea pig.

108
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,800
 I'll add to your pay.

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,240

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,480
He deliberately gave me more money because he's afraid I won't accept it.

111
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,771
My tummy hurts.

112
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,500
Jiang...

113
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,940
Jiang Muying.

114
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,620
You're already very familiar with this surgery, right?

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,670
You're done with the surgery, Boss?

116
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,480
Why did you choose this approach?

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,100
Is there a problem? I still have time to make changes.

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,520
I mean, why did you choose this less common approach

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,500
instead of the more reliable pterional approach?

120
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,320
That girl is only 17 years old.

121
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,900
She told me she likes singing and dancing.

122
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,860
And that she wants to major in performing arts.

123
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,440
Her tumor isn't very big.

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,020
I want to protect her hearing and facial nerves, so I chose the approach with the smallest incision.

125
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,240
With a smaller incision, the surgical field is also more limited.

126
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,150
The operation will be more complex.

127
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:01,160
If that's the case, I'll just peel it layer by layer, until it's all clean.

128
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,200
Aren't you afraid?

129
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,040
I am.

130
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,919
But Su Wei'an reminded me.

131
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
She said, when a doctor is operating, they should be pure and selfless.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,280
Since they picked up the scalpel, they must provide the best treatment for the patient.

133
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,200
Su Wei'an said that?

134
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,160
That day, Dr. Li told me to choose the approach I'm most confident in to overcome my psychological barriers.

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,240
But I still agree with what Su Wei'an said.

137
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,620
She's pretty awesome.

138
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,180
If she hadn't dropped out, she would've become a very skilled surgeon.

139
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,960
She'll come back.

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,540
What's the matter, Boss?

141
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,720
She didn't even accept money?

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,060
That doesn't seem like Su Wei'an's style.

143
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,940
We're done for, Boss.

144
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,480
Jiang Jiang said she gave away the secret.

145
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,920
She said Su Wei'an found out about you using a fake girlfriend to deceive her.

146
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,510
An An.

147
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,080
Are you planning to go back to the hospital to work?

148
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,920
If the new drug doesn't go to market, what are you going to do in the future?

149
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,080
Auntie, this isn't something I should worry about.

150
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,960
Why is it not?

151
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,580
You also carry the gene that causes this disease.

152
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,860
That report can only deceive your mom.

153
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,760
There's nothing I can hide from you.

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,040
I can tell. You and that Dr. Gu like each other.

155
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,020
No way.

156
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,320
My mom already said that Dr. Gu is excellent, and I'm not good enough for him.

157
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,822
I've noticed that after stopping the medication, my reactions have been more intense than before.

158
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,160
I often can't control my emotions.

159
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,180
I feel like I'm not the same person as I used to be.

160
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,940
I don't want you to become like me.

161
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,140
I hope that you live with even more courage than I did, without any regrets.

162
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,300
I hope that you live with even more courage than I did, without any regrets.

163
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,580
Auntie, I'm doing great now.

164
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
I have no regrets.

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,420
As long as our family is together and happy every day, that's enough for me.

166
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,320

167
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,720
 This handwriting... It's Gu Yunzheng.

168
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,480
Mom.

169
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,860
Where did this notebook come from?

170
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,480
When I went to the hospital that day to pick up medicine, Dr. Gu gave it to me.

171
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,520
He's quite scrupulous. He wrote this personally, right?

172
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,760
I'm going to bed. You should sleep early too.

173
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,480
Go to sleep.

174
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,040
 Look, Su Wei'an.

175
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,380
 You even did extra data calculations for me and found so many papers to cite.

176
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,000
 You've never given up your passion for medicine.

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,100
 These habits of medical students...

178
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,400
 You've kept them even after being away from school for four years.

179
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
 Why do you always say one thing but mean another?

180
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,830

181
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,725
 You can resist, but I won't give up.

182
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,140
Do you really want to distance yourself from me that much?

183
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,700
You won't even eat the cookies I bought.

184
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,860
Su Wei'an, you're really...

185
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,020
really a kid who says one thing and means another.

200
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,540
Hello, Senior.

201
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,620
It's so late. What's the matter?

202
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,580
I just finished dinner with a client.

203
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,740
Coincidentally, it's near your bar.

204
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,700
I want to watch you perform.

205
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,160
 I didn't go to the bar today. I had something else to take care of.

206
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
Really?

207
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,100
That's okay then. I'll have a couple of drinks by myself.

208
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,940
I'll treat you next time we go to the bar.

209
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you for staying up all night translating with me.

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,660
 No problem.

211
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,040
 - By the way, I have a friend—  
- Senior, I have to hang up now.

212
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,420
So now you know.

213
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,940
I don't have a girlfriend.

214
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,630
I got it.

215
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,000
But it has nothing to do with me.

216
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,400
Don't you want to ask me why I did that?

217
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,820
Maybe you had too much money and wanted me to help.

218
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,380
Or maybe you've been too bored lately and wanted to make fun of me.

219
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,480
How am I supposed to know why?

220
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,940
But Dr. Gu, your intelligence and talent being used in such petty tactics is really such a waste.

221
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,220
If you have time to make such a notebook, why not do some more surgeries?

222
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,960
Is taking responsibility for my own patients also considered as playing tricks?

223
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,420
If I hadn't played such tricks, Su Wei'an, you wouldn't face your true feelings at all.

224
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,200
I know what my true feelings are. You don't need to remind me.

225
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,700
Su Wei'an, stop trying to be tough.

226
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,160
You clearly remember everything about us.

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,660
You're not as carefree in facing life as you claim to be.

228
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,900
Since you've chosen to think of me when you felt most helpless,

229
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,480
why are you pushing me away when things get better?

230
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,340
Sorry, Dr. Gu. I've caused you trouble.

231
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,160
How come you still don't get it?

232
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,400
I'm more than happy to be troubled by you.

233
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,060
Gu Yunzheng!

234
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,500
Su Wei'an, I won't force you to make any decisions anymore.

235
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,640
You have plenty of time to think it through carefully.

236
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,270
If one day you decide to look back,

237
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,540
I'll always be behind you.

238
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,020
And the door of the lab is always open to you.

239
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,060
Genetic defects...

240
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,700
don't mean you can't have a normal life.

Have you ever thought that

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,520
if one day, an accident happens before the illness, and I were to leave you first,

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,080
would you regret not being with me?

266
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,980
Auntie.

267
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,120
Xiao Du. Are you here for Wei'an?

268
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,100
No, I'm here to see you today.

269
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,500
Me?

270
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,620
Then let's go in and talk.

271
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,060
Okay.

272
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,580
Come here, Xiao Du. Please come inside.

273
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,070
Okay.

274
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,180
Come. Sit here.

275
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,360
Auntie, my... my shoes.

276
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,700
Don't bother to change them. I haven't mopped the floor anyway.

277
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
Please come inside.

278
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,860
Sit there.

279
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,560
You came at just the right time.

280
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,760
I think Wei'an has been too tired these past couple of days.

281
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,820
- I made some spare rib soup for her. Try some first. 
 - Auntie.

282
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,000
Please don't bother.

283
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm not here for Wei'an this time.

284
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,340
I'm here for you specifically. I want to talk to you about Wei'an's aunt.

285
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,240
She's asleep. Here, let's move further in.

286
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,540
Sit here.

287
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,880
Her aunt is asleep.

288
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,280
Tell me, what's the matter with her aunt?

289
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,140
Here's the thing.

290
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,120
I've already reported her aunt's case to Zhang He Hospital's research and development team.

291
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,340
We're not sure if the aneurysm is related to the drug trial,

292
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,240
but it did happen while Auntie was trying the drug.

293
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,680
I feel a bit guilty.

294
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,360
Please don't.

295
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,060
Xiao Du, I trust that your team's original intention behind developing this drug is to cure and save lives.

296
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,510
Now, A'Yuan has an aneurysm.

297
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,740
This is a result none of us wants to see.

298
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,340
Don't blame yourself.

299
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,720
Auntie, on behalf of Jiehui,

300
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,880
I want to provide you with appropriate financial compensation.

301
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,320
This time's hospital expenses, as well as future nursing expenses, will be covered by Jiehui.

302
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,160
No, we can't do that.

303
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
Xiao Du, you're Wei'an's senior brother.

304
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,600
Since her aunt fell ill, you've been helping us so much.

305
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,030
I'm telling you, I really can't trouble you anymore.

306
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,200
How has Auntie's recovery been going recently?

307
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,500
How has she been feeling after stopping the medication?

308
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,840
To be honest, not very good.

309
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,900
After stopping the medication, I don't know if it's just psychological,

310
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,120
but her physical reactions are even worse.

311
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,160
The more this occurs, the more she struggles emotionally.

312
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,540
Sometimes, she loses her temper and breaks things.

313
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,520
Auntie, you've been having it tough these days.

314
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,980
How about this?

315
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,280
Let me arrange a nursing home for Wei'an's aunt.

316
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,180
This way, you won't be too exhausted,

317
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,800
and they can help you share some of the burden.

318
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,880
There's no need. I'm already retired.

319
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,820
I don't have much to do at home. I can take care of her.

320
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,400
Auntie, the nursing home can provide more professional treatment

321
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,520
in physical rehabilitation and psychological counseling for Wei'an's aunt.

322
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,640
Also, it is beneficial for slowing down the progression of chorea.

323
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,280
I see.

324
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,080
Then... Is this nursing home expensive?

325
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,900
This nursing home has an annual agreement with Jiehui.

326
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,240
As long as it's someone arranged by us, there won't be any additional charges.

327
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,560
There's space available anyway.

328
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't worry about it.

329
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
Then that'll be great.

330
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,080
But I still have to discuss this with Wei'an.

331
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,800
Auntie, considering Wei'an's temper and personality,

332
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,980
if you discuss this with her, how could she possibly owe me this favor?

333
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,740
Besides, a nursing home is the best option for Wei'an's aunt right now.

334
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,800
How about this, Auntie?

335
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,960
In a couple of days, take Weian's aunt to the nursing home for a visit.

336
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,840
If she is satisfied, then you can make the decision.

337
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,080
Right, it's best for A'Yuan to see for herself.

338
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,740
And of course, don't tell Wei'an that I recommended it.

339
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,640
I understand.

340
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,360

341
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,500
 -   
 -

342
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,940
Drink.

343
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,080
You're done with the translation work?

344
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,220
It's done.

345
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,800
By the way, I found a few nursing homes. Take a look.

346
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
There's no need. I've arranged everything.

347
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,360
You have? How?

348
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,520
It's the lady in Unit 503 of Building A.

349
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,300
I often run into her when buying groceries.

350
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,840
Her son came back from abroad and opened a new kind of nursing home with his friends.

351
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,223
She said I could get a discount, since they just opened.

352
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:28,620
You're not close friends, so how much of a discount can you get?

353
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,520
- 7% off? 
 - 70% off.

354
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
- 7% off? 
 - 70% off.

355
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,940
70% off? How's that possible?

356
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,200
Is this place reliable?

357
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Go take a look and you'll see.

358
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:08,880

359
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,620
What do you think? I'm right, aren't I? Your aunt likes this place.

360
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,130
It is a good place.

361
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,040
But are you sure about the 70% off?

362
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,960
You don't have to worry about the money.

363
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,260
I can take care of it with my secret hoard.

364
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,280
But even with the discount, it's still 4,000 yuan a month.  (563.50 USD)

365
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,720
Your pension can't be enough.

366
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,040
I did some stock trading recently and made a little money.

367
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,160
You even manage to lose money when playing mahjong with kids.

368
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,840
But you learned how to trade stocks?

369
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,560
Don't talk about your mom like that.

370
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,160
It's just that lady in Unit 503 of Building A—

371
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,300
The grocery shopping lady with the son who came back from studying in America.

372
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,500
Yes. Didn't he study finance?

373
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
He has some inside information.

374
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Plus, your mom is intelligent, beautiful, and witty.

375
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,340
So I earned a little bit of money.

376
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,840
He isn't your illegitimate son, is he?

377
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,160
He's so nice to you.

378
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,840
This naughty girl is being mischievous again.

379
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,820
I'll go check on Auntie.

380
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,840
Wei'an's aunt is checking in today.

381
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,920
Have you made all the arrangements with the nursing home?

382
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,520
Yes.

383
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,500
The caregiver has a master's degree in nursing.

384
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,980
The age, qualifications, and education all meet your requirements.

385
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm sure Ms. Su will be comfortable and satisfied.

386
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,960
Okay. One more thing.

387
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,420
Talk to the nursing home staff and make sure no one disturbs Auntie's recovery.

388
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
I will.

389
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Okay. You can go.

390
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,440
Is No. 18 ready? Hurry it up, please. I'm about to go overtime.

391
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,900
No. 16. I'm sorry.

392
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,500
It's okay.

393
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,240
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine.

394
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,280
They live a very fulfilling life.

395
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,340
When I no longer work as a doctor, I'll be a deliveryman.

396
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,360
I can earn as much as I do now. The point is, I won't be stressed out.

397
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,400
Why? Why would you be a deliveryman instead of a doctor?

398
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,920
It's nothing.

399
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,900
Are you going to be the lead surgeon tomorrow?

400
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm the one currently scheduled.

401
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,380
But they might not need me.

402
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,520
After all, our hospital has so many great doctors.

403
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,605
Come on. Let me take you somewhere.

404
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,356
Where are we going, Jiang Jiang?

405
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,960
When did you learn jiu-jitsu? How come I didn't know?

406
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,180
Last time, Dr. Li showed off her skills at the bar,

407
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,060
and I thought it was really cool.

408
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,180
So I learned a few tricks to guard against perverts.

409
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
Perverts?

410
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm your boyfriend, not a pervert.

411
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,620
Fang Mingfan, just treat me as your inner demon today.

412
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,200
It's either I defeat you or you defeat me.

413
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,320
Give it your all.

414
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,840
I don't think this is a good idea. What if I hurt you?

415
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,300
I've trained before. It's not so easy for you to hurt me.

416
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,960
Come on.

417
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,000
- I-I'm coming, then. 
 - Come on.

418
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,260
It hurts. Spare me, Jiang Jiang. Please spare me.

419
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
What have I done? Why are you doing this to me?

420
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,320
Fang Mingfan! When you can't beat me, you just beg for mercy.

421
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,580
When you don't want to do surgery, you just find excuses.

422
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,280
If you're always thinking of a way out, you'll never win!

423
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,360
You don't understand. I'm just afraid of hurting them.

424
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,300
Afraid! You're always afraid!

425
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,080
You're a coward!

426
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,580
I'm not a coward!

427
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,460
I'm not a coward!

428
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,400
Fang Mingfan, you always run away when you encounter problems.

429
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,060
You deserve to be your boss's tag along.

430
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,300
No wonder He Xiaoguang looks down on you.

431
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,560
Who would respect a coward?

432
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,700
I'm not a coward!

433
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,620
♫  That sweetness from the past  ♫

434
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,300
♫  It's beyond my reach  ♫

435
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,680
♫  It's as if fate is playing a game with me  ♫

436
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,660
♫  It's as if fate is playing a game with me  ♫

437
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,220
♫  I still think of it from time to time  ♫

438
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,980
♫  It's hard to explain what I'm feeling  ♫

439
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,840
♫  Perhaps I understand it too well  ♫

440
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,940
I'm not a coward.

441
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,100
You can do it.

442
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,360
You already know this surgery by heart. Believe in yourself.

443
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,940
You're going to be fine.

444
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,060
Boss, maybe you should be my first assistant.

445
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
If anything happens, you can take my place.

446
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,060
I have a consultation in the respiratory department later.

447
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,820
I already asked He Xiaoguang. He'll be your first assistant.

448
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,940
He'll help you when you need it.

449
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,480
Why him?

450
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,600
I want him to witness your success so that he won't dare to look down on you anymore.

451
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,580

452
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,840
Boss, do you want to come in?

453
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,300
No, I just came to take a look.

454
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,160
Dr. Gu, if you can't stop worrying, stay and be his first assistant.

455
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,200
Fang Mingfan has studied this operation countless times.

456
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,140
As long as you don't drop the ball, there won't be any problems.

457
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,720
Boss, you should go back.

458
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,540
Stop hanging around at the door.

459
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,560
With you standing here, I still don't feel like this operation belongs to me.

460
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,940
It's okay. Don't worry and leave it to me.

461
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
Okay. See you later.

462
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,600
Okay.

463
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,960

464
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,620
My father's been very withdrawn lately, and he forgets things often.

465
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,720
I'm worried that he has Alzheimer's disease.

466
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,440
I take him on trips often. This time, he's been running a fever since coming back.

467
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,300
According to the MRI, there is an expansion of the ventricular system and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid, along with cerebellar atrophy.

468
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,560
Does he usually fall when walking?

469
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,680
He's unsteady when walking and needs to be watched. Sometimes, he even has to use a wheelchair.

470
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,500
How about eating and sleeping? Is everything normal?

471
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,560
He hasn't been able to eat while in the hospital this time.

472
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,180
When someone feeds him, he can eat a few bites.

473
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,460
I'll order a lumbar puncture later and check his cerebrospinal fluid.

474
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,180
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

475
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,960
Dad, what's the matter? Dad!

476
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,300
Dad!

477
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,060
Dad!

478
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,960
Dr. Gu.

479
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,520
Put this on.

480
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,980
- What happened? 
 - This morning, a critically ill patient's blood test revealed Yersinia pestis. 
  (T/N: the bacterium causing plague)

481
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,400
As instructed by the CDC  (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) , the entire building is now under emergency closed-loop management.

482
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,060
No one is allowed in or out.

483
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,440
Dr. Gu, why don't you call your family and let them know?

484
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,980
Okay.

485
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,680
I left my phone in my office. I didn't bring it with me.

486
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,080
Then do you want to use mine?

487
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,120
It's okay. I'll use the landline and call my department first.

488
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,520
Okay.

489
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,080
Dr. Gu, you're the only neurosurgery expert in the entire building right now.

490
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,520
The Otolaryngology Department just requested a joint consultation with the respiratory and neurosurgery departments.

491
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,180
- Okay. I'll head over right now. 
 - All right.

492
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,600

493
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,200
Doctor, how's my daughter?

494
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,300
The operation was very successful.

495
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,000
She'll be under observation in the ICU for now, and she'll be transferred to the general ward when she stabilizes.

496
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,460
- Thank you, Doctor. 
 - Thank you, Doctor.

497
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,220
- You're welcome. 
 - Thank you.

498
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,420

499
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,180
Boss.

500
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,300
He isn't back yet?

501
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,040
Fang Mingfan, you were in surgery so you probably don't know yet.

502
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,440
There's a Yersinia pestis case in the inpatient building.

503
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,420
Your boss has been quarantined inside.

504
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,100
Sorry.

505
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,100
- Fang Mingfan! 
 - Jiang Jiang?

506
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,200
How was it? Was the surgery successful?

507
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,690
It was very successful.

508
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:22,020
I knew you could do it.

509
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,710
You're awesome.

510
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,540
Jiang Jiang, thank you for always being by my side and encouraging me.

511
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,560
Without you, I couldn't have overcome my psychological barriers.

512
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,840
What's wrong? Are you not happy about the surgery?

513
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,460
Why does it feel like something's bothering you?

514
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,080
I heard there's a Yersinia pestis patient in the inpatient building. Boss is trapped there.

515
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm really worried about him.

516
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,320
- Hello, Jiang Jiang. 
  - Hey, Wei'an.

517
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,120
 Bad news. Dr. Gu might be in danger.

518
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,940
What do you mean?

519
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,940
Let me talk to her.

520
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,200
Hey, Wei'an.

521
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,440
 This morning, Boss went to the respiratory department for a consultation.

522
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,320
 In a patient's sputum (phlegm), Yersinia pestis was detected.

523
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,800
The entire inpatient building has been sealed off now. You can get in, but not out.

524
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,080
The pneumonic plague?

525
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,000
That's a Class A infectious disease. If you get infected, it can be life-threatening.

526
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,440
 The entire building is undergoing epidemiological investigation and analysis now.

527
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,200
It should be under control soon.

528
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,420
Okay, let's not talk now. Let me make a call.

529
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,080
 Wei'an. Don't bother to call.

530
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,120
 Boss didn't take his phone with him to the consultation.

531
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,320
 I have his phone right now.

532
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,420
- Let me go in. 
 - Can I get in? 
 - Excuse me.

533
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,840
This girl's shoes are scattered everywhere.

534
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,740
An An, are you home?

535
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,820
- Mom, I... I'm going on a business trip. 
 - What are you doing?

536
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,240
Where are you going?

537
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,940
Why haven't I heard you talk about it?

538
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I'm going to Gui City  (Guilin) . It was scheduled a long time ago. I just forgot to tell you.

539
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,320
Then let me cook some noodles for you. Eat before you leave.

540
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,520
I don't have time. I have a plane to catch.

541
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,620
Is it that urgent?

542
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,800
- Slow down. 
 - Mom.

543
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,740
Avoid crowded areas for now, and stop going to square dancing too.

544
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,760
Wash your hands immediately when you get home. Always wear a mask when you go out.

545
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
- Call me if anything happens. 
 - Okay.

546
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:10,000

547
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,100
