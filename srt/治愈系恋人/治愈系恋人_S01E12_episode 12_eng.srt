 'Pursue Love' - Chen Zhuoxuan

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,460
♫  Don't be afraid, no matter how long the journey  ♫

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,800
♫  Love embraces gentleness and care  ♫

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,440
♫  Those scars will eventually heal and turn into the blossoms gathering along time's journey  ♫

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,200
♫  Eventually, someone will take them away for you  ♫

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,540
♫  Don't feel lonely moving on  ♫

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,960
♫  Let time in on your story  ♫

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,120
♫  Expect a soft ray of light in response  ♫

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,600
♫  May you find her admist the crowd  ♫

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,180
♫  May you find joy in simplicity  ♫

♫  May you always carry your passion every Winter and Summer  ♫

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,880

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,880

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm just seeing you put so much effort into this project. I want to help you relax.

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,900
Okay, if you say no, I won’t do it. It's all up to you.

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,400
Right, Yuncheng, Grandpa's birthday is coming up soon.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,640
What gift do you think I should get him?

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Grandpa said he doesn't want a birthday party this year. Old people don't like the excitement.

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,140
Then I'll buy some fruit and go see him this weekend.

22
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,900
He is a diabetic. He can't eat fruit.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,820
He'll appreciate your regard. You don't have to visit him.

24
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,820
I'm just caring about Grandpa.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,880
Yuncheng.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,340
We've been in a relationship for so long. I aim to be together with you.

27
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,120
Oh, I have to go on a business trip this weekend. Let's talk about it next week.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,153
Okay.

29
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,040
The registration window is closed?

30
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,340
But it's not passed the registration deadline yet.

31
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,160
Well, we've already received our needed 300 subjects for the Phase III trial.

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,420
Director Yang, my aunt is in a special condition. Her disease has been developing rapidly.

33
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm afraid if she can't participate in this drug trial,

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,780
she won't have a chance to use it when HDQ39 goes on the market.

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,180
So, please do me a favor.

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,820
For family members of patients, every patient's condition is very special and urgent.

37
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:17,780
I fully understand your feelings. However, clinical trials need to follow strict specifications and requirements.

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,160
Any illegal operation may directly affect the results of drug research. So that's prohibited.

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,380
But given that this is a rare disease, we want to seize any hope.

40
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,320
Is there any other way?

41
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,740
Thank you.

42
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,840
Hey, how about this...

43
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,380
You can register your information and be an alternate.

44
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,580
We'll inform you as soon as possible if there are any changes.

45
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,640
Okay. Thank you.

46
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,920
What's the matter with you? You can't even keep up with my drum rhythm.

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,040
Brother, our band requires teamwork.

48
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,260
- Do you know what teamwork is? 
 - It's you who invited me here.

49
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,800
You can fire me if you want, or you have to put up with me.

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,160
You're not competent for the work.

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Where did this child come from?

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Let me try it.

53
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,920
Everybody thinks they're a musician these days.

54
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,860
Have you recognized her? She's Su Wei'an!

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
You still know to come back after leaving us three years ago?

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,340
Please forgive me for that and give me a chance to make money again.

57
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,200
Could we afford a player who comes from France?

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,460
Stop making fun of me. When will the show start?

59
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,216
We need to rehearse right now. The show will start tonight.

60
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,500
Let's roll!

61
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,640
Three, two, one, go!

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,125
Are you still busy with work? Take a break.

63
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,040
Thank you, Mom. I'll drink it later.

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,500
You've been busy with work recently.

65
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,860
You need to take care of your health. And spend some time with Xiao Ran.

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,980
- Oh, she's complained to you again. 
 - That's not a complaint.

67
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,720
Just a young lady in a relationship wants to chat with someone and relieve her bad mood.

68
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,700
I really don't have the time and energy to deal with her bad mood.

69
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,659
Why don't you help relieve her bad mood?

70
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:32,240
Yuncheng, I like Xiao Ran not only because she's Professor Wen's daughter

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,780
but also because I can see she truly loves you and cares about you.

72
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,052
Got it.

73
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,770

74
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,140
 Yuncheng, help!

75
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,764
 Someone is harassing me and won't let me go. I'm so scared!

76
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:53,169
What's the matter with Xiao Ran?

77
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,220
- I'll check it out. 
 - D-Do we need to call the police?

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,193
- Wait for my message. I'll deal with it. 
 - Be careful!

79
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,160
You said someone is harassing you. I thought you were drunk.

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,380
If I didn't say it seriously, would you come here?

81
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,680
Look, a celebration party I carefully prepared for you. Do you like this grandeur?

82
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,708
Let's celebrate the joint research of you and my dad on HDQ39 successfully entering the clinical trial stage.

83
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,120
Come on.

84
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,040
Let's raise a toast to my two favorite men.

85
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,200
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

86
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
Enjoy yourselves!

87
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,660
 Thank you, Miss Ran!

88
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,860
Xiao Ran. A drug trial isn't considered successful until the drug finally goes to market.

89
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,400
I don't want to be distracted by any trivial matters before that.

90
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Trivial matters?

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,600
How is a party I carefully prepared for you trivial?

92
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,540
I need to go to the bathroom.

93
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,440

94
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,100
Did a doctor treat his wound?

95
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,460
Did a doctor treat your wound?

96
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,491
It's not a doctor, but a Chinese lady who treated my wound.

97
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,931
He said a Chinese lady helped treat his wound.

98
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,877
Su Wei'an. It must be her!

99
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:54,440
Dr. Gu.

100
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
Su Wei'an!

101
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,280
What's the matter?

102
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,261
Excuse me, did you bring an injured patient here and treat his wound?

104
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:13,540
Yes, I used to be a nurse. What's the matter with the patient?

105
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,080
Nothing. You took care of the wound well. Thank you.

106
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,580

107
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,440
We don't have to work tomorrow.

108
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,963
Have more fruits, Sister Ran.

109
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,523
Let's have more drinks.

110
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,600
 Why is Su Wei'an back?

111
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,620
Yuncheng! What are you looking at?

112
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,380
I think I saw Su Wei'an.

113
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,960
How is that possible? Su Wei'an is in Lakaya now.

114
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,680
We spoke with her on the phone not long ago. If she came back, she would definitely inform us.

115
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,700
- I might have mistaken the person. 
 - Right.

116
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,440
Yuncheng, since I've dedicated myself to preparing this celebration party for you,

117
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,280
do me a favor even if you don't like it.

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:28,640
Xiao Ran, I never wanted a celebration party. Focusing on work is a better use of my time.

119
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,280
Well, let's sit and talk for a while, and then we'll call it a day.

120
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
Is that okay?

121
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,100
 Has Yuncheng not let go of his infatuation with her?

122
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,200
My housekeeper, turn on the lights.

123
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,260
How come she's back?

124
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,060

125
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,970
 Her last login is at Jinhai City.

126
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,940
I didn't mistake her.

127
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,940
That was really Wei'an.

128
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,400
How did you find time to have a video chat with me?

129
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,340
Did you not hang out with your Fang Mingfan on your day off?

130
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,280
 Why should I hang out with him?

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,400
 I don't know him well yet.

132
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,540
Do you fight again?

133
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
Could he have found another girl to shift his love to?

134
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,520
 Even if he wanted to, he wouldn't have time.

135
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,980
Their schedules have been packed with surgeries. Too bad they can split into two people

136
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,440
And what about... him...

137
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,280
 Dr. Gu once mistook someone for you and went after the person.

138
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,100
 Jiang Jiang, are you there?

139
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,900
 No, I'm not.

140
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,300
All right. You can go out and meet him. I'm going to bed.

141
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
 Good night.

142
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,120
Jiang Jiang. Jiang Jiang!

143
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:02,160
Jiang Jiang, I'm about to return to China with Boss. What are your plans?

144
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,400
I-I should have gone home earlier.

145
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,000
I've been on this job for too long.

146
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,080
But what about Flattie?

147
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,760
Who will feed you after I leave?

148
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,160
Flattie...

149
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll take care of it. We both live in Jinhai City.

150
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,400
You can come to my place and visit Flattie whenever you want.

151
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,180
Will we meet again when we return home?

152
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,820
What's wrong with that? Are you planning to be irresponsible and abandon me after seducing me?

153
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,600
What are you talking about? "Abandon you after seducing you?" Don't use idioms you don't know.

154
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,260
Besides, we weren't that close. We're just ordinary friends.

155
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,660
What ordinary friends? Aren't we close?  Have you seen ordinary friends who have kissed each other?

156
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,840
Why are you bringing that up? Stop mentioning it.

157
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,080
I can take care of Flattie anyway.

158
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,960
Come here, Flattie.

159
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,380
I can bring Flattie back to China and keep it at my house.

160
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,420
But there is a condition.

161
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,400
What condition?

162
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,700
You need to be the other guardian of Flattie.

163
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,680
Do you want me to be a poop-scooper?

164
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,980
What poop-scooper?

165
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,560
I meant my girlfriend.

166
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,800
Jiang Jiang, would you like to be my girlfriend?

167
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,680
Where are you going?

168
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,420
Please answer me.

169
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,300
Yes.

170
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,380
 Wei'an.

171
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,977
 The scenery you missed, I'm enjoying it now for you.

172
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,420
 Hi! How are you doing?

173
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,340
 Can it be Nero Bridge? I hear there's a day for Light Festival every year.

174
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,220
 I've stayed in Lakaya for a long time, but I just haven't witnessed it.

175
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,880
 It's been a long time since I last enjoyed such a quiet night comfortably.

176
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,320
 I don't need to think about anything. I only need to quietly enjoy such a beautiful starry sky.

177
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,660
 You promised me to enjoy the Nero Bridge together.

178
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,120
 You're running away again.

179
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,400
Grandpa.

180
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,280
 Yunzheng, your dad said you didn't apply for an extension.

181
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,420
 Why? Did you argue with my granddaughter-in-law?

182
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,200
She's gone. She's not in Lakaya anymore.

183
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,920
Why?

184
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,580
Grandpa, am I an unlucky guy?

185
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,360
In any close relationship, I'm always the one

186
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,420
who gets abandoned.

187
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,640
 That's nonsense.

188
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,320
When have I ever abandoned you?

189
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,440
Listen, come back if you're unhappy in Lakaya. I'll always be waiting for you at home.

190
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,480
Okay.

191
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,700
Grandpa, I'm going to hang up now. Bye-bye.

192
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:05,350

193
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:21,730

194
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:30,580

195
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,000

196
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600

197
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,300

198
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,700

199
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,900
 Why is mom's name on the bridge?

200
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,100
 It's January 12th. It's my birthday.

201
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:15,160
 This is the real dark rainbow you sent me.

202
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,525
 You never abandoned me.

203
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:22,650
 The time has come. It's time to go back.

204
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,180

205
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
Hello, Miss. Who are you here to meet?

206
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,820
Excuse me, is your company in charge of the HDQ39 project?

207
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Yes, our CEO is personally overseeing this project. Why do you ask about the project?

208
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,240
I want to meet your CEO, could you arrange a meeting for me?

209
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,380
Have you made an appointment? You can't enter our company without an appointment.

210
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,440
But I need to see him for something extremely urgent.

211
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,460
I'm sorry, Miss. I can't help you with that.

212
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:15,640
Where are you going, mMiss? You're not permitted to enter.

213
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,360
You're not permitted to enter. You can't enter without an appointment. I'll call security if you don't stop.

214
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
- This is a critical matter. 
 - No. You're not allowed inside.

215
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,780
- Wei'an? 
 - Please leave.

216
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,088
Senior Brother.

217
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:36,100
Wei'an, when did you come back?

218
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,240
I saw someone at the bar the other day. I thought it might be you, but I wasn't sure then.

219
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,200
It's me. I am the drummer for a night band at the bar.

220
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,600
You just left all of a sudden back then. Why did you suddenly decide to come back?

221
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
It's a long story.

222
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,500
What about you? Why did you give up your career as a doctor?

223
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,380
As a doctor, I can only make limited contributions to medical science.

224
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,840
Compared to surgeries, the development of a new drug can benefit more patients.

225
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,580
And Jiehui is different from other pharmaceutical companies, as we prioritize social benefits.

226
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,080
For example, in developing HDQ39, an "orphan drug,"

227
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,780
we bear immense pressure. But I believe it is meaningful.

228
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,180
Senior Brother, I need you to do me a favor.

229
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,880
I...

230
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,980
A distant relative of mine was recently diagnosed with Huntington's Disease.

231
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,440
I want to enroll her in the HDQ39 drug trial.

232
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,400
But when I tried to register her at the hospital, they already had enough participants for the Phase III trial.

233
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,180
And we can only be on the waiting list.

234
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,120
No problem. Let me know if you need any help. I will do everything I can to assist you.

235
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,920
Wei'an?

236
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,540
It's you!

237
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,720
When did you return?

238
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,800
You mentioned Huntington's Disease just now. Who is suffering from that illness?

239
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,620
It's a distant relative of mine. She was recently diagnosed with it.

240
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,800
I am here to seek eligibility for the drug trial.

241
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,320
You should have asked me for help. My dad is in charge of the HDQ39 project.

242
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,640
What does this have to do with Yuncheng?

243
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,900
I left you a message, but you didn't reply.

244
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Really?

245
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
I have my message notifications turned off. I didn't notice it.

246
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,380
Xiao Ran, don't forget to mention it to Professor Wen. You should put more thought into matters regarding Wei'an.

247
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,120
Of course, I will. Wei'an is my best friend, after all. I'll definitely help you.

248
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,120
 Professor He, I hate to claim credit,

249
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,300
 but in fact, I did most of the work for the project design and result discussion.

250
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,620
 I'm usually busy with my duties at the student union, so I asked Wei'an to report to you.

251
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,740
 I need this paper for a competition, so I need to be listed as the first author.

252
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,800
 Is that the truth?

253
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,120
 I remember it's Su Wei'an who is usually working alone in the lab.

254
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,200
 Oh, I'm always unlucky!

255
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,480
 You always miss me when I'm working in the lab.

256
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,420
 The order of authorship can be discussed privately between the two of you.

257
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:45,300
 Wei'an... can be bad-tempered and a bit domineering.

258
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,940
 I'm not good at competing with others.

259
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,280
 I used to give in and let her have all the authorship rights.

260
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,580
 But things are different this time. Professor He, please help me.

261
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,623
 I'm afraid that would be inappropriate.

262
00:23:57,623 --> 00:24:00,520
 Oh, Professor He, I have one more matter.

263
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,380
 My dad is about to start a large-scale and interdisciplinary clinical research.

264
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,680
 He's looking for external doctors to join the team.

265
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,480
 He specifically asked me to ask you if you're interested in participating.

266
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,140
 Your father? Director Wen... he knows about me?

267
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,280
 How could he not?  You are my supervisor!

268
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,800
 I used to praise your academic level to my dad every day.

269
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,640
 Really? Please send my regards to Director Wen.

270
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,480
 Wei'an... can be bad-tempered and a bit domineering.

271
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,320
 Director Wen... he knows about me?

272
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,480
 How could he not?  You are my supervisor!

273
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,580
 - Please send my regards to Director Wen. 
 - Okay.

274
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,800
Wei'an? Wei'an?

275
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,020
Why are you silent? What do you think?

276
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:01,700
About what?

277
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Yuncheng suggested that we take this opportunity to grab a bite to eat together.

278
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,360
We can discuss the enrollment details later.

279
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,060
Okay.

280
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm so happy, Wei'an.

281
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,200
I didn't expect that we would be sitting at a table together again.

282
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I thought you would never talk to me again.

283
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,520
Wei'an,

284
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,220
you can't imagine how much I envy you for dropping out of school.

285
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,920
Medical school is so tough and there's so much competition.

286
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,380
You used to be the most hardworking one.

287
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,640
But you just decided to give up your career

288
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,680
and escape from the pressures of awards, competition, and papers.

289
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,660
How's Lakaya? Is it fun there?

290
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,740
It's easy to make money there.

291
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,260
Making money?

292
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,760
Isn't that a poor place? Can you really make money there?

293
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,660
Because it's underdeveloped, I took advantage of the information gap to find some earning chances.

294
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,760
I always knew you're like a female Buffett who is underappreciated by Huaren.

295
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,990
Honestly, I really envy you for your wonderful experiences.

296
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,380
As for me, I've spent eight years on exams and research in school.

297
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,660
I've become so poor.

298
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:31,040
But thankfully, Yuncheng and I come from medical families,

299
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,760
and we don't have that desire

300
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,250
to get rich overnight.

301
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:43,840
- Wen Ran, watch your words. 
 - It's great to get rich overnight.

302
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,620
If you come across such opportunities, please share them with me.

303
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,800
Wei'an, who are you trying to apply for the drug trial for?

304
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,880
It's a distant relative of mine who was recently diagnosed.

305
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,535
When I tried to sign up, they said they already had all 300 participants.

306
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:13,660
Is that true? Then we can't help you with that.

307
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,760
We can't increase the number of participants to 301 just for you.

308
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,060
You're an upright and principled person who always despises using connections.

309
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,580
If I don't understand the proper boundaries, I might annoy you again.

310
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,200
Allow me to help you if you're uncomfortable asking.

311
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,780
Participating in the clinical trial and receiving the specific drug early is our only hope.

312
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Wen Ran,

313
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,900
for the sake of our past relationship as classmates,

314
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,600
please do me this favor.

315
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,780
Don't say that. I desperately pity you.

316
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,660
Since you're pleading so pitifully, I'll definitely help you.

317
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,840
Otherwise, Yuncheng won't be happy.

318
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,360
Wei'an,

319
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,380
I'll try my best to help you.

320
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,800
But my father always values the strictness of scientific research.

321
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,900
His decisions are not easily changed.

322
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,980
So I'm not confident in succeeding.

323
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,160
Thank you, anyway.

324
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,460
- I... 
 - I'm going back to Huaren.

325
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,580
Where are you going, Wei'an? Let's see her off.

326
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,860
No need. I'll take the subway.

327
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,060
- Let me walk you out. 
 - Yeah, Wei'an. Take a few extra steps.

328
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,320
And I can spend a little more time with Yuncheng.

329
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,400
No, really. I'm leaving.

330
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,900
Bye-bye.

331
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,340
I didn't expect Su Wei'an to be like this today. She used to be so dignified.

332
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,560
I can't believe she's humbling herself to beg my connections.

333
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,060
Xiao Ran, you're not even planning on helping her, are you?

334
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:27,380
What? How can you think that of me?

335
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,660
This is the first time Wei'an has asked for my help. I will definitely help her.

336
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:35,460
But it depends on my dad. You know how he is.

337
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,660
Let me talk to him right now.

338
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,160
President Du.

339
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,700
Help me contact Director Yang

340
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,740
to apply for an additional participant to join the Phase III clinical trial

341
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,700
under Professor Wen's HDQ39 project. Figure it out.

342
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,180
- Understood. 
 - Wait a minute.

343
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,000
It's a small matter. We don't need to inform Professor Wen.

344
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,680
Understood.

345
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,840
What are you doing?

346
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,460
- Mom. Have you seen the stone on my nightstand? 
 - What?

347
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,880
What stone?

348
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,780
I saw it was there this morning!

349
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,640
- Is it the small stone about this size? 
 - Yes.

350
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,880
I thought you didn't need it anymore, so I threw it in the trash can.

351
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,180
- You threw it away? 
 - Yes.

352
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,480
Is it valuable?

353
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,380
- Is it from your boyfriend? 
 - Uh-huh.

354
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,400
It might be in the kitchen trash can.

355
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,320
Wait.

356
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Come here.

357
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,020
Come here.

358
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,940
Let me do a magic trick for you.

359
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,360
Blow into here.

360
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,680
Look. Is this it?

361
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,260
Why is it here?

362
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,780
Is this the stone?

363
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,000
Well, I noticed that you always place it on your nightstand.

364
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,040
I can tell that it's from someone important to you. Isn't it?

365
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,180
How about my trick? I managed to get your secret out. Tell me about him.

366
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,080
What's his name? How tall is he? What does he look like?

367
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,120
- Where does he live? 
 - I don't have a boyfriend!

368
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,940
I... I use the stone to make wishes. It will bring me fortune.

369
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,880
- Give it back to me. 
 - I don't buy your story. Take it.

370
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,340
If it's as important as you say, you should keep it safe.

371
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,500
Not many people are as clever as your mom.

372
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,580

373
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,800
 - Are you okay, miss? 
 - I'm fine.

374
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,820
 Excuse me.

375
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,840
Master, what do you think? How should we decorate it?

376
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,340
In my opinion, we don't need to decorate it.

377
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,980
Because no matter what we do, it won't make it any prettier. It's just a stone, and it's this big.

378
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,060
After decorating it, are you planning to wear it as a necklace?

379
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,020
Beware of getting cervical spondylosis. 
  (T/N: age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck)

380
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,980
You're exaggerating. It's not that heavy. How could it possibly give me cervical spondylosis?

381
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,040
Do you really like this stone? What's the story behind it?

382
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,740
In my eyes, it's a priceless treasure.

383
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,780
Young lady, have you been deceived?

384
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,740
It's just an ordinary stone. It's worthless.

385
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:06,400
The stone itself may be worthless, but it carries some unforgettable memories for me.

386
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,680
Then let me find a way to redesign it as a keychain accessory.

387
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,280
That way, you can carry it with you.

388
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
Great.

389
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:23,280
Will that damage the stone?

390
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,420
You can trust me. I will polish it carefully.

391
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,720
It's your priceless treasure.

392
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,900
Tell the boy who gave you this stone.

393
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,560
He should give you some gold and silver jewelry, like a gemstone, a diamond ring...

394
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,820
Even if you break up, they can be sold for money.

395
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,540
- Happy birthday, Uncle! 
 - Thank you.

396
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,800
- Happy birthday, Sir! 
 - Thank you.

397
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
Dad, I wish you a healthy and long life.

398
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,500
This is wild ginseng that Yuncheng put great effort into getting from the medicinal materials trade route in Yunnan.

399
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,700
Isn't that right, Yuncheng?

400
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,500
Former Supervisor, Happy birthday!

401
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,900
Why did the subject choose to withdraw from the trial?

402
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,480
 I don't have that information.

403
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,640
 In any case, in a drug clinical trial, the top priority is the patient's voluntary participation.

404
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,500
 No one can intervene if they refuse.

405
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,460
I understand.

406
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,330
Ensure that Wei'an's aunt goes through the legal process to join the trial.

407
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,395
Don't worry. Since a subject has withdrawn, Director Yang will be happy to accept her and fill the vacancy.

408
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,500
 Now he must be grateful to Su Wei'an's relative.

409
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,100
Great.

410
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,600
Mom.

411
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,705
It's Grandpa's birthday today. Wen Ran is not attending the party.

412
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:14,895
I asked her why, but she hesitated and told me to ask you.

413
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:18,540
Tell me, are you bullying her again?

414
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,640
Professor Wen is going on a business trip today.

415
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,220
I sent her to see him off at the airport. What's wrong with that?

416
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,740
Why did she complain about such a small matter?

417
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,220
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

418
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,920
I already told Grandpa that you would bring your girlfriend here.

419
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,580
Now how should I save face in front of so many people?

420
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,090
You're in your fifties.

421
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,140
You should know how to handle it before boasting.

422
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,850
What do you mean by boasting?

423
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,525
Isn't Wen Ran your girlfriend?

424
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:57,230
Isn't her father the director of the Neurology Department at Zhang He Hospital? Aren't you two planning to get married?

425
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,260
Du Yuncheng, do you think highly of yourself since you've taken charge of the company?

426
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,420
Wen Ran is a good girl. It's your luck to marry her.

427
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,680
My luck? No, that's your luck.

428
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,300
At the present stage, I haven't planned to marry her.

429
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,000
It's you who urgently wants her to marry into this family and have her become the Du granddaughter-in-law.

430
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Then who am I doing all of this for?

431
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,720
It's all for you to become the rightful eldest son of the Du family, and to gain the favor of your grandpa.

432
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,680
Your grandpa's house is worth at least tens of millions. Even if you have to share with Gu Yunzheng, it's a lot.

433
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Mom.

434
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,160
How come you still don't get it? Even if I were to marry the best girl in the world.

435
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,530
Gu Yunzheng would still be the only person in Grandpa's heart.

436
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,800
The granddaughter-in-law whom grandpa expects can only be Gu Yunzheng's wife.

437
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,440
What's so important about the house? I have no interest in it at all.

438
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,720
No matter what you do, Grandpa won't change his will.

439
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,980
Stop wasting your time.

440
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,280
What are you talking about, brat?

441
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,440
Don't think you can talk to me like that just because you're the president of Jiehui.

442
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,040
What happened to him? Why doesn't he go over there?

443
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,620
Nothing happened. He hasn't been resting well due to work stress.

444
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,640
He's in a bad mood.

445
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,300
He's not a doctor. He doesn't have to work shifts at the hospital.

446
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,340
Hasn't he been resting well? You're kidding.

447
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,720
Old Du, Yuncheng

448
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,540
may not be as talented as Yunzheng in medicine, but he has been working hard too.

449
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:45,220
Jiehui has achieved good results under his leadership over the years, but I haven't seen you or dad praise him much.

450
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,520
From now on, stop comparing your two sons.

451
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,220
Yuncheng lives in the shadow of his younger brother every day, he can't help worrying.

452
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,480
Yuncheng... is looked down upon all because of me.

453
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,020
How can you say that? Who dares to look down on my son?

454
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,160
I am strict with him for his own good. Is there anything wrong with it?

455
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,600
He only complains to me. He never disgraces you in front of others.

456
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,440
Don't be too hard on him.

457
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,820
In this house, you are his dad, not the director of the hospital.

458
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,100
Have I ever received good results from being kind to him?

459
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,900
He gave up his career as a doctor. Look at what he's pursuing now, he's ruining himself.

460
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,920
As an old saying goes, "An uncut gem does not sparkle."

461
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,380
But you shouldn't be too harsh on him.

462
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,560
Now, he's the only son carrying your last name.

463
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,560
By this token, he's your only son.

464
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,440
Stop.

465
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,340
Both of them are my sons, regardless of what last name they carry.

466
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,220
Thank you.

467
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,440
So many good things.

468
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Thanks for spending money on me.

469
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,720
Grandpa!

470
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,480
- Yunzheng! 
 - I'm back.

471
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,340
You're back!

472
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,220
I'm back to celebrate your birthday.

473
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,000
Yunzheng has just returned from Lakaya.

474
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,920
Grandpa, I brought you many wonderful gifts this time.

475
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,440
Look at this. These are wild moringa seeds from Lakaya.

476
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
They're good for diabetics.

477
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,620
- Are they delicious? 
 - Taste them yourself.

478
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
They have a sweet aftertaste.

479
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,060
 You're so stingy. You bring so little from such a far distance. It's not enough for me.

480
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,740
 It's not melon seeds. Two or three seeds at a time is enough.

481
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,940
- If you like them, I'll bring you more next time. 
 - Okay.

482
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,370
- Have your seats. Come on. 
  - Have your seat, Grandpa.

483
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,900
Why did you come back so soon?

484
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,720
Weren't you planning to stay for another year?

485
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,200
I just wanted to come back.

486
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,340
Do you know what day it is today?

487
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,880
Friendship Hospital is hosting a commendation conference. Many embassy officials are attending.

488
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,120
You should have come back after attending the conference and receiving your commendations.

489
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,580
I have completed my own tasks there. The rest has nothing to do with me.

490
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,320
Your tasks may be done, but your honor has been given up.

491
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,520
Who will remember you if you keep on acting like this?

492
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,460
Luckily you still have me. I won't let your efforts go to waste.

493
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,080
The hospital has decided to promote you to an associate chief.

494
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,340
We will make the announcement on your first day back to work.

495
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,340
You talk as if I owe you a favor.

496
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,811
Promotion is a comprehensive decision made by department leaders.

497
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:35,820
I've performed over 800 surgeries, and engaged in assistance for two years.

498
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,800
I have earned this associate chief through my own efforts.

499
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,960
Grandpa, this is palm candy.

500
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,400
I learned to make it from a patient's family.

501
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,580
It's made from palm sap. It's especially friendly to diabetics.

502
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,425
You can have one whenever you want.

503
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,580
I want it now.

504
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,490
Just try it.

505
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,720
- Yunzheng! 
 - That's enough.

506
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,865
It's my birthday, don't act like the hospital director in front of me.

507
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:10,560
Even I can't bear to speak loudly to my grandson.

508
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,500
 What did he do wrong? Why are you scolding him in front of everyone?

509
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,900
 Dad, stop spoiling him. Look at what he has become.

510
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,760
Thanks to my spoiling, he has become so excellent.

511
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,060
If he were even more excellent, I think you might be jealous of him.

512
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:33,600
Yunzheng, I heard that you once performed a surgery with a gun to your head, is that right?

513
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,160
You even heard about that?

514
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,120
The person with the gun to my head is General Kouyate.

515
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,360
When he heard I was returning to attend your birthday party,

516
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,300
he chased me to the airport just to give me this, his gift for you.

517
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,660
It's a pocket watch made in Germany during World War II.

518
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,620
I've checked it already, and it's very accurate. It's just like you, growing stronger with age.

519
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:10,440

520
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,960
