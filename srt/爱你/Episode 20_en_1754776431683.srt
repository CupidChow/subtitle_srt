3
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,990
Dr. He. Waiting for your girlfriend again?

4
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,950
Yes, indeed.

5
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,370
Here's your spicy hot pot.

6
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,180
You already gave me your door code.

7
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,760
Why did you still come down to meet me?

8
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,060
Didn't you say you missed me?

9
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,530
So I came down early to meet you.

10
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,329
So nice of you.

11
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,770
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

12
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,170
What are we having today?

13
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,200
We're having...

14
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,960
Guess.

15
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,650
Bamboo shoots?

16
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,210
You want bamboo shoots?

17
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,730
Okay.

18
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,880
I'll make another dish for you then.

19
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,260
You're extra supportive of my
cooking today.

20
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,760
Got a good appetite?

21
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,420
Today,

22
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,320
I accomplished something big.

23
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,540
Yan Heng checked out.

24
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,160
I always thought

25
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,360
I'd have some kind of argument
with him when the time came.

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,120
But when it really happened,
I was surprisingly calm.

27
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,040
Because...

28
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,320
I've completely moved on.

29
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,170
That indeed

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,930
is a big accomplishment.

31
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,650
He Suye.

32
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,600
Thank you for never letting go of my hand.

33
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,089
What are you thanking me for?

34
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,950
Didn't I also get myself a girlfriend?

35
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,150
Alright, let's eat.

36
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,770
Let's eat.

37
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,490
Oh, right.

38
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,710
I need to make a run home after dinner.

39
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,890
My parents have been worried
about me because of this.

40
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,550
I need to go home and tell them.

41
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,159
Sure.

42
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,600
Then eat more.

43
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,930
Don't get hungry later.

44
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,580
Is it not good?

45
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,030
It's really good.

46
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,830
Then eat more.

47
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,400
I want some more soup.

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,810
You shouldn't eat rice soaked in soup
like this. It's bad for your stomach.

49
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,360
That's pretty good.

50
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,460
What kind of person Yan is

51
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,710
is another matter.

52
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,280
Just think of this as a part of
your life journey.

53
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,420
Walking gracefully to the end

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
should be considered a good thing, right?

55
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,730
Did he make you cry?

56
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:42,210
No. I was completely fine. Don't worry.

57
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,570
Have you told He about this?

58
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,030
I have.

59
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,830
As you should.

60
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,100
Otherwise, he might be worried.

61
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,080
You should invite He over for dinner,

62
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,390
so that we can formally meet.

63
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,430
Last time he came to our house,
it was a complete mess.

64
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,820
We don't want him to think that

65
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,120
our family is not good.

66
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,390
Okay, no problem.

67
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,670
Well,

68
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,480
I'll talk to him about it later.

69
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,030
Alright.

70
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,800
Are you not coming to see me later?

71
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,150
No. I'm going to spend more time
with my parents.

72
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,760
By the way,

73
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,290
my parents are asking if you're
free this weekend.

74
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,490
They want to invite you over for dinner.

75
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,010
This weekend?

76
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,920
Sure.

77
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,830
Okay, okay.

78
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,500
Ms. Shen.

79
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,100
I think you haven't been taking Chinese
medicine for a while.

80
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,780
Why don't you ask Dr. He to check
your pulse again

81
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,940
and prescribe some Chinese medicine
for you?

82
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,560
Your body still needs conditioning.

83
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,200
I've been doing pretty well lately.

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,350
I have a good appetite.

85
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,370
I don't want to take Chinese medicine
anymore.

86
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,650
Why not?

87
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,380
Chinese medicine is long-term medication.

88
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,460
Besides,

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
who has such easy access to Chinese
medicine as you do?

90
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,470
You can just have a date with
your boyfriend,

91
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,990
get your pulse checked, and get
the medicine prescribed.

92
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,080
And you still don't want to take it?

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,270
It's too bitter.

94
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,800
Get up.

95
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,350
-Come downstairs and take a walk with us.
-What?

96
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,770
I'm not going. I just got off work.

97
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,570
I want to rest.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,170
Why are you so lazy?

99
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,060
You just had dinner.

100
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,730
Staying cooped up here isn't good
for digestion.

101
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,260
Didn't Dr. He tell you that?

102
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,090
No.

103
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,159
Get up.

104
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,970
Go to your room and put on a coat.

105
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,640
It's cold outside.

106
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
Okay.

107
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,650
Tell me quickly that

108
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,850
lying down right after eating doesn't
affect digestion.

109
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,490
I don't want to go downstairs for a walk.

110
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,590
Doctors can't lie.

111
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,010
Here you go.

112
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,770
Thank you.

113
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
The food is here.

114
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,770
I want that fried cake.

115
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,490
That... Fried cake.

116
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,200
Aren't you two taking a walk to aid
digestion after dinner?

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
Why are you eating again?

118
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,159
It's after-dinner dessert.

119
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,260
We got hungry from walking. Got a problem?

120
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,820
Eat up.

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,580
My university organized a hike
for this weekend.

122
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,640
Let's go together.

123
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,039
Those women in our research team...

124
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,170
Mrs. Shen. Mr. Shen.

125
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,690
Good evening.

126
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,710
Good evening.

127
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,250
What a coincidence.

128
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,030
Why are you here?

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,060
Well, Xifan told me that you two
wanted to see me,

130
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
so I quickly got ready and came down.

131
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,300
I...

132
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,130
Right.

133
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,280
Yes. We wanted to meet you.

134
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,680
Well.

135
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,960
I've been telling Xifan

136
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,410
to ask you over for dinner.

137
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,700
We should meet you formally, right?

138
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,400
I must have misunderstood.

139
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,660
But it's convenient anyway.

140
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,230
We live in the same neighborhood, right?

141
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,370
Xifan can give me a call anytime,

142
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,470
and I'll come right over.

143
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,390
-Yes.
-Right.

144
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,370
We've talked about it several times already.

145
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,210
Come anytime.

146
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,730
Okay.

147
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,130
Mr. Shen's cooking is really delicious.

148
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,390
You're flattering me.

149
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,050
When I have a chance, I'll learn from
you, Mr. Shen.

150
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,110
I love cooking too.

151
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,420
How's your cooking?

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,520
It's okay.

153
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,180
That's great.

154
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,040
From now on, Ms. Shen

155
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,130
won't have to worry about her
meals anymore.

156
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,850
Mom.

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,970
Dad.

158
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,520
After having my cooking tonight,

159
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,010
why did you sit down again?

160
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,890
Didn't we agree we'd take a walk
to digest?

161
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,610
Let's go, let's go.

162
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,850
We're still continuing that walk?

163
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,250
We two need to walk more. We ate
too much tonight.

164
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,210
Let's go, let's go.

165
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,010
But I haven't eaten... This yet.

166
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,590
Well,

167
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,340
you guys,

168
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,720
order more yourselves, okay?

169
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,700
-Order yourselves.
-Okay.

170
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,730
See you at home another day.

171
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,160
Let's set a formal date for that meal.

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,950
Okay, no problem.

173
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,970
Goodbye. Goodbye.

174
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,100
W-We didn't mean to chase you two away.

175
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,580
I think

176
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,460
your parents like me quite a lot.

177
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,980
You showed up suddenly on purpose,
didn't you?

178
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,550
No, I didn't.

179
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,470
Didn't you tell me you were taking a walk
with your parents?

180
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,400
Wasn't that specifically to call me over?

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,610
That's not it.

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
Isn't that so?

183
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,500
He Suye.

184
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,650
I've discovered

185
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,780
you can be quite shameless sometimes.

186
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,780
It's alright, I guess.

187
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,840
What do you want to eat? I'll order
it for you.

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
You're annoying.

189
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,960
Here.

190
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,040
It's iced.

191
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,160
Without ice. Without ice.

192
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
What? Are you going through
a rebellious phase?

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,230
No.

194
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,600
I just suddenly realized yesterday that
I don't have to take Chinese medicine anymore.

195
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,730
So I can have some cold drinks now.

196
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,030
You're not afraid of being caught, huh?

197
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,580
If I get caught, I'll just deny it.

198
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,980
Besides, he has to take care of me
no matter what.

199
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,130
Nice.

200
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,710
Dr. He doesn't want you to have
cold drinks

201
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,790
for your own good.

202
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,260
So you're not letting her have
this drink or what?

203
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,460
Go ahead.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,280
Xifan.

205
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,250
Now that you're with Dr. He,

206
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,490
when can we have dinner with him

207
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,620
and let him meet your dearest friends?

208
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,140
How about this weekend?

209
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
He works at the clinic on Saturdays.

210
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,850
He doesn't work on Sundays.

211
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,510
We're available this Sunday.

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,260
Okay. I'll ask him.

213
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,510
What do you usually do on your dates?

214
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,490
I go to his place,

215
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,890
and he cooks or makes medicated
diet for me.

216
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,340
So simple?

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Alright then.

218
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,330
I'll take care of all the fun stuff.

219
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,760
You just need to be there.

220
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,650
Thank you, Sis.

221
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,860
My girlfriend is so cool.

222
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,650
The scenery is pretty nice, isn't it?

223
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,240
Xifan.

224
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,640
Coming.

225
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,710
It's really comfortable to take
a walk here.

226
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,300
And it's not cold at all.

227
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,660
We've just passed the Awakening of Insects
in the solar terms,

228
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,730
which marks the time when spring thunder
awakens the hibernating insects

229
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,340
and everything comes back to life.

230
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,310
As for people,

231
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,850
we should also be like those
hibernating insects,

232
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,450
coming out to exercise a bit.

233
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,490
He's always like this.

234
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,640
Am I wrong?

235
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,100
Isn't the place I picked really nice?

236
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,380
The atmosphere here is great, isn't it?

237
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,950
I really like it here.

238
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,890
Well...

239
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
We forgot to bring drinks, right?

240
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,250
I see they're selling drinks over there.

241
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,180
I'll go buy some.

242
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,220
Comrade, I'll leave them in your care.

243
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,600
Good luck.

244
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,370
Come back soon.

245
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,190
Dr. He.

246
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,140
Could you take a couple of nice
photos for us?

247
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,940
With my phone.

248
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,270
You want me to take photos for you?

249
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,260
Okay.

250
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,090
Let's go.

251
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,060
Is it heavy?

252
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,860
It's alright.

253
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,090
Over there, over there.

254
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,510
Let's go.

255
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,230
Be careful.

256
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,400
Dr. He, please don't feel any pressure.

257
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,040
If you really don't know how,

258
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,420
just keep pressing the button
over and over.

259
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,680
Taking photos is such a simple task.

260
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,210
How could I feel pressured?

261
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,080
Just a moment, let me adjust the settings.

262
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,250
I need to adjust the white balance,
brightness, and such.

263
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,940
He even knows about settings?

264
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,170
I have no idea.

265
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,210
Done.

266
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,690
Come on, look here.

267
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,660
So pretty.

268
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,010
One more.

269
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,210
Three, two, one.

270
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,490
Xiangya.

271
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,390
His photos on social media are
really ugly.

272
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,910
Smile bigger.

273
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,610
With such beautiful models,

274
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,200
it would be hard for him to take
ugly photos of us, okay?

275
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,730
You two, look at each other.

276
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,620
Three, two, one.

277
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,170
Look at me, look at me.

278
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,950
Something's not right.

279
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,520
Why do I feel he's getting further
and further away from us?

280
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,560
Three, two, one.

281
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,810
I think we should call him.

282
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,610
Dr. He, don't go any further.

283
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,870
Come back for a moment.

284
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,060
Look.

285
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,750
Take a look.

286
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,780
How are they?

287
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Aren't they absolutely pretty?

288
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,820
Aren't they gorgeous?

289
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,580
We asked you to take close-ups.

290
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,830
There are close-ups.

291
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,720
Look at the first few ones.

292
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,370
This one.

293
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,020
Do you see it?

294
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,040
Both your heads are big in this one.

295
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,170
Aren't they?

296
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,220
Are our heads really that big?

297
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,910
Are our legs really that short?

298
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,220
Are we really that fat?

299
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,620
But...

300
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,950
But you do look like this

301
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,170
to me normally.

302
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,010
What?

303
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,870
Is there... Is there any problem?

304
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,340
Don't they look good?

305
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Lin Yishen!

306
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,730
Pretty. Really pretty.

307
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,570
Stand closer.

308
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,850
Right, closer.

309
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,630
Yes, that's right, that's right.

310
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,110
Hug, hug.

311
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:51,740
Hug.

312
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,130
Got it, got it.

313
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,680
We've got some great shots.

314
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
The last few ones.

315
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,450
Show your teeth.

316
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,370
Yes, show your teeth.

317
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,210
Right, right.

318
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,540
"Got some great shots"?

319
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,470
I can take great shots too.

320
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,190
What's...

321
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,730
What's so great about it?

322
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,510
The last two.

323
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,050
Okay.

324
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,110
X-rays count as shots too, you know.

325
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,770
Check them.

326
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,010
Wow, these are so pretty.

327
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
How are they? Are you satisfied?

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,730
They're really well taken.

329
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,210
Comrade.

330
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,500
Let's go, time to go to the next location.

331
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,450
Can you hold this for me?

332
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,770
I'll go to the next location first.

333
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,210
Go ahead.

334
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:30,810
I'm going.

335
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,370
Can you hold this for me too?

336
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,110
Let's go.

337
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,380
Let's go.

338
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,830
Wait.

339
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,770
When you say comrade, you mean
these things?

340
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,770
Sacrificing me to help you succeed?

341
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,690
Buddy, you should know that

342
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,890
in the past, all these things were on me.

343
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,360
I used to act as a coat rack

344
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,990
while also taking photos for them.

345
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,390
Now, I finally have you

346
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,890
to help me share the burden.

347
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,460
Of course, you should know that

348
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,890
in the days to come,

349
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,160
there will be many more moments
for us to fight together.

350
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,090
That actually makes sense.

351
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,050
It was my fault for not giving it
much thought.

352
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,010
I originally thought we were just coming
out for a walk today

353
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,940
to enjoy the scenery.

354
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,740
Buddy.

355
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,740
Your awareness still needs improvement.

356
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,910
When you go out with your girlfriend,

357
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,220
isn't the most beautiful scenery

358
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,849
your own girlfriend?

359
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,190
Let's go.

360
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,990
Wait a moment.

361
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,490
Can't you help me carry some of these?

362
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,320
Come on, hurry up.

363
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,920
They'll get impatient if we keep
them waiting.

364
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,860
Hold on.

365
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Look over there.

366
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,340
Look at the camera.

367
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,770
This is a video,

368
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,430
not a photo.

369
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,200
Videos look more natural.

370
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,120
You can take a screenshot of

371
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,290
the frame you like. It looks much
better than a photo.

372
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,740
I didn't know we could do that.

373
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,280
Come on.

374
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,410
Why did you suddenly kiss me?

375
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,230
Didn't you say this way of taking photos
is more natural?

376
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,390
You're a quick learner when it comes
to this, aren't you?

377
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,450
Of course. Just look at who taught me.

378
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,750
Today,

379
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,210
are you happy?

380
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,670
Today,

381
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,260
I guess I'm pretty happy.

382
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,950
I just didn't expect my girlfriend
to complain

383
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,320
about my photography skills.

384
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,690
I didn't complain about your
photography skills.

385
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,020
Let me comfort you then.

386
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,630
Alright.

387
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,190
How could I really be angry?

388
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,500
Actually, I'm quite happy today.

389
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,660
The last time I saw them

390
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,860
was during the medicated diet project.

391
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
We were all in work mode then.

392
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,280
I didn't expect them to be like this
in private.

393
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

394
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,040
Besides,

395
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,490
I also learned

396
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,960
a new way of taking photos from
my girlfriend.

397
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,290
How could I not be happy?

398
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,360
They are my best friends.

399
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
Seeing you get along well with them,

400
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,170
it actually makes me really happy.

401
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,810
Senior Lin set up a group chat for us.

402
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
He posted today's photos there.

403
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,110
They're pretty, aren't they?

404
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,440
So that's how you take this kind
of photos.

405
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,940
Let me try.

406
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,830
You're quite diligent, aren't you?

407
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,370
Come on, there's more to see.

408
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,740
I'm just worried you'll complain
about it again.

409
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,660
I didn't complain about it.

410
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,770
You didn't?

411
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,970
Why don't you pick a photo and send
it to Grandpa?

412
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,170
He's so envious knowing we're together.

413
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,900
How about you cheer him up a bit?

414
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,460
What about this one?

415
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,270
Okay, this one will do.

416
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,850
I'll send it to you then.

417
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,150
Come to think of it, it's already been
a year since we first met.

418
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,920
The cherry blossoms were blooming
back then.

419
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,240
At that time, I was seeing you
for my insomnia.

420
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,100
That's right.

421
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,860
I put in so much effort to pursue you.

422
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,230
I worked hard too, okay?

423
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,180
This is what we call mutual effort.

424
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,770
There's even a video.

425
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,520
Let me show you.

426
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,210
What video?

427
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,300
The video we recorded there.

428
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,260
This is a video.

429
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,350
Look. Look at you.

430
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,110
This video is pretty good too.

431
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,880
Send it to me.

432
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,210
I'll take a screenshot and send it
to Grandpa.

433
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,730
Sure.

434
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
Three, two, one.

435
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,780
Screenshot.

436
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,570
How is it?

437
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,040
This one's not bad.

438
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,240
You winked like this.

439
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,370
Right?

440
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,300
Okay, I'll go with this one then.

441
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,720
Okay. Let me crop it a bit.

442
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,920
Wow, so sweet.

443
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,120
Don't you think

444
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
they look a bit like a married couple?

445
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,810
Are you serious?

446
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,760
My daughter is better looking
than him, okay?

447
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,110
But Dr. He is so handsome.

448
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,250
Remember how he caused a stir

449
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,930
in the residents' group chat back then?

450
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,770
I remember.

451
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,650
The vibe of this photo is really great.

452
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,490
The vibe is especially good.

453
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,700
Xiangya and Senior Lin took this.

454
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,270
Right?

455
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,520
It's really pretty.

456
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,250
This is good. It's secretly photographed.

457
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,440
Both the people and the scenery
are beautiful.

458
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,310
Happy.

459
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,380
I'm envious.

460
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,020
One day, can we also...

461
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,420
You're so ugly,

462
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,080
how could you achieve that effect?

463
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,040
We'll just take a photo together
as a memento.

464
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,560
It's not like we're doing it for some
other purpose.

465
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,040
Look how beautiful the scenery is.

466
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,490
I'll have to properly edit your photos
then.

467
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,290
That's right.

468
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,520
This is like the iron tree blooming,

469
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,840
and spring coming upon a withered tree.

470
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,330
I'm a little shy.

471
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,370
That's wonderful.

472
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,280
You two are truly a couple destined
to be together.

473
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,130
It's wonderful, really wonderful.

474
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,210
Oh, by the way,

475
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,690
Shen,

476
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,820
I'm checking out the day after tomorrow.

477
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,410
Huh? What's the matter?

478
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm going back to

479
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,570
live with my kids.

480
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,960
This way, I can hang out with my
grandchildren every day.

481
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,040
Why so sudden?

482
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
Originally, due to the side effects
of radiotherapy,

483
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,210
I was worried that I'd trouble them

484
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,690
and they'd be concerned.

485
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,240
So I thought I'd come back to China
for a trip.

486
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,260
But during this time,

487
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,460
Dr. He has treated me very well.

488
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,330
I rarely cough now,

489
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,800
and my mental state has improved a lot.

490
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,410
Also, seeing you like this

491
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,320
makes me want to see my kids too.

492
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,000
Xifan.

493
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,370
During this time, really,

494
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,970
thank you so much for your care.

495
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,570
Not at all.

496
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm actually really happy to chat
with you.

497
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,320
When are you going to Switzerland?

498
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,170
In October, I guess.

499
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,200
October...

500
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,170
If my health condition allows,

501
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,770
I'll go to Switzerland to visit you.

502
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,600
Really?

503
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:17,970
That'll be great.

504
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,080
I'll send you my location when
I get to Switzerland then.

505
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,600
Okay.

506
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,920
There's one more thing.

507
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,440
Could you arrange for me

508
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,580
to see Dr. He one more time?

509
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,640
Preferably

510
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,760
at a time when you can be there too.

511
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,810
Is that okay?

512
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
No problem.

513
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,390
Great.

514
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,610
The condition of your lungs and throat
has improved a lot.

515
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,790
You should keep warm in daily life,

516
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,980
and avoid catching cold.

517
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,950
Eat more moisturizing foods,

518
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,810
such as lilies and pears.

519
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,050
Okay.

520
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,160
But most importantly,

521
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,820
you still need to have regular tumor
check-ups.

522
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,040
Thank you for your trouble.

523
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,880
Dr. He.

524
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,630
Thank you and Xifan for taking care
of me during this time.

525
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,070
I want to give you two

526
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,390
a gift.

527
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,420
Paeonia lactiflora,

528
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,440
also known as "Jiangli" (about to leave).

529
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,760
I'm about to leave,

530
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,170
but I want to leave this affection
and blessing with you.

531
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,860
I hope you'll be happy and blessed.

532
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,730
Thank you both.

533
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,400
How's it?

534
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,100
Looks good?

535
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,750
It feels like this wall isn't so empty
anymore.

536
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,050
Alright, I'll go wash my hands first.

537
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,450
I'll cook for you in a bit.

538
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:42,750
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

539
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,050
Dr. He, let me do you a favor.

540
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:51,120
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

541
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,480
Doesn't it look like a ring?

542
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,220
It's yours now.

543
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,690
I lost that thing you gave me at noon.

544
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,940
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

545
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,360
It disappeared right when I got off work.

546
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,340
How about I buy you another one?

547
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,190
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

548
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,470
He Suye.

549
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,580
What is this?

550
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,480
This... What is this?

551
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,960
I found it on your tool shelf.

552
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,850
Tell me.

553
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,700
Oh, right.

554
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,740
Isn't this the metal ring from your
keychain?

555
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,440
I lost it at the time.

556
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,360
Later, I found it under the sofa,

557
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,540
so I just put it away casually.

558
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,880
Wait a minute, casually?

559
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,450
You first casually put it on the tray
by the door.

560
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,320
Now you say you casually put it
on the tool rack.

561
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,950
Keeping such a small thing for so long.

562
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,430
Tell me.

563
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,660
Did you like me from the very beginning?

564
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,380
That makes sense.

565
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,210
I've finally found

566
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,840
the reason why I hid it.

567
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,810
So that's it.

568
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,690
You...

569
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,170
It's obvious you were the one
who fell for me first,

570
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,770
yet you're claiming I made a move
on you first.

571
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,570
Get back here.

572
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,170
Me liking you and you making a move on me

573
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,770
aren't mutually exclusive.

574
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,120
When you gave this to me as a wedding ring

575
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,880
at that time,

576
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,770
weren't you making a move on me?

577
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,170
Who gave it to you as a wedding ring?

578
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,770
I was just helping you out of
a tight spot.

579
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,630
So you admit it.

580
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,140
You did give it to me as a gift.

581
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,730
You made a move on me first.

582
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm a man in my thirties.

583
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,600
How could I have resisted such a hint?

584
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,080
So as soon as you gave me a hint,
I took the bait, didn't I?

585
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
No one was giving you a hint, okay?

586
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,410
Alright, stop talking.

587
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,590
As for this thing,

588
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,860
I've always treasured it.

589
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,120
Now,

590
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,390
I'm going to keep it somewhere else.

591
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,410
He Suye, come here.

592
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,200
I...

593
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,220
Made a move on him first?

594
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,400
What are you carrying?

595
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,580
I brought some medicinal herbs
from the clinic.

596
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,870
It's currently the change of seasons.

597
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,800
I'm planning to make some new
medicated diet for you.

598
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,170
Are there any Chinese herbs that can
be steeped in water?

599
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,220
I'd like to make tea of it at the hotel.

600
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,080
Licorice root.

601
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,170
That works.

602
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,100
Alright, I'll get you some in a bit.

603
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,420
Licorice root

604
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,600
has a sweet taste and neutral nature.

605
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,800
It clears heat and detoxifies,

606
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,150
tonifies the spleen and boosts qi.

607
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,360
You can take a few slices and steep them
in water to drink.

608
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,620
It probably tastes as good as bubble tea.

609
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,520
At 11:45 PM,

610
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
he asked, "Still not sleeping?"

611
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,690
Do you think a guy would care

612
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,420
when a woman he's not interested
in goes to sleep?

613
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,450
He barely posts on WeChat Moments.

614
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,000
Look.

615
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,910
He posted one about licorice root.

616
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,770
This handsome TCM physician
is quite calculating.

617
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,650
He clearly posted it on Moments on purpose

618
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,600
to make you like it, so that he could
chat with you.

619
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,380
And what happened?

620
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,040
You're only liking his post from
months ago now.

621
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,460
He Suye.

622
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,440
That post on Moments about licorice root
from before.

623
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,500
You posted it on purpose, didn't you?

624
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,160
No.

625
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,150
I was having dinner at Grandpa's.

626
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,420
I happened to have some
licorice root water,

627
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,080
so I casually posted about it.

628
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,440
Is that so?

629
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,860
But Senior Lin said you did it on purpose.

630
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,320
So you listened to him

631
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,050
and started to make a move on me?

632
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,430
I...

633
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,380
In that case,

634
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,370
we should thank Senior Lin.

635
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,560
I...

636
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:52,800
Didn't...

637
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,330
Let's go.

638
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,520
When we get home,

639
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,040
let's give him a call to thank him.

640
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,210
Without him, we wouldn't be together.

641
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,140
I... Made a move on you?

642
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,090
[Honganmen Clinic]

643
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,030
Wait a moment for me.

644
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,550
I have a document to sign.

645
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,200
Okay.

646
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,000
The pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

647
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,750
Pharmacy decoction

648
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,660
takes about four hours.

649
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,580
So,

650
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:23,050
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

651
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,200
I'll leave it here.

652
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,530
-Take care.
-Thank you.

653
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,480
Miss Shen.

654
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,550
Our pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

655
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,970
Pharmacy decoction

656
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,860
takes about four hours.

657
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,000
So,

658
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,710
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

659
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,580
Miss Shen, I forgot to remind you.

660
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,290
The pharmacy closes at 5 PM.

661
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,130
Pharmacy decoction

662
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,790
takes four hours.

663
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,120
So,

664
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,510
you can come pick it up at around 2 PM.

665
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,380
Let's go.

666
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,010
What's wrong?

667
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,060
He Suye.

668
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,730
Every time a patient collects medicine,

669
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,130
the pharmacy gives them a reminder, right?

670
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,210
Then that time,

671
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,730
why did you specially come out

672
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,130
to remind me?

673
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,580
I always remind my patients.

674
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,790
Really?

675
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,679
Yes.

676
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,500
Really?

677
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,510
Come on, let's go.

678
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,880
Why are you standing here?

679
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,730
Really?

680
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,449
Are you lying to me?

681
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,530
What would you like to eat?

682
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,020
Quail eggs, noodles,

683
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,050
shrimp paste,

684
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,210
fresh tripe, and squid tentacles.

685
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,000
A bit of everything.

686
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And make it two.

687
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,440
Two portions.

688
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,130
And one...

689
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:33,840
One with spice,

690
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,880
and the other without.

691
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,800
Okay, got it.

692
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
Please wait a moment.

693
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
Still thinking about it?

694
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,800
Under normal circumstances,

695
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,320
I would remind my patients,

696
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,449
in case Ms. Wu at the pharmacy forgets.

697
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,449
But you left so quickly that day.

698
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,900
I didn't have a chance to remind you
before you left.

699
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
So I had to

700
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,680
hurry out to remind you.

701
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,800
What if you went there too early

702
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
and couldn't get your medicine?

703
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,290
That's not right.

704
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:12,390
You were wearing a mask when you
examined me.

705
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,610
Why did you take it off when you came out?

706
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,090
You don't think I took off my mask
on purpose, do you?

707
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,030
Come on.

708
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,840
Doctors in hospitals take off their masks

709
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,430
to get some fresh air too, you know.

710
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,020
I just happened to run into you.

711
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,350
What could I do about it?

712
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,650
Is that so?

713
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,090
What else could it be?

714
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,650
You don't think I took off my mask
and came out

715
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,180
to see you out of some ulterior
motive, do you?

716
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,120
I think

717
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,200
you had ulterior motives from the first
time you saw me.

718
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,080
Who's the one with ulterior motives here?

719
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,570
The first time you saw me,

720
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,280
you looked me up and down from
head to toe.

721
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
Don't think I didn't notice.

722
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,540
Also, the way you looked at me,

723
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,440
it was like this.

724
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,960
Correction. I didn't look at you
like that.

725
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,090
I'm a TCM physician.

726
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,090
I was taking your pulse.

727
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,690
I could tell from your pulse.

728
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Besides, I did remind you

729
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,350
to stay calm during pulse taking.

730
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,750
Did you manage to do that?

731
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,370
Alright, let's not say anything more.

732
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,370
Thank you, sir.

733
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,250
Chopsticks.

734
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,910
Here.

735
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,510
Okay.

736
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,260
Not bad.

737
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,190
Don't eat the spicy one. Eat the one
with clear broth.

738
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,030
He Suye, I need to clarify something.

739
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,570
The first time I saw you,

740
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,050
I didn't have any feelings for you.

741
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,650
Besides, at that time, Yan Heng
and I hadn't...

742
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,860
In short,

743
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,110
I had no feelings for you at that time.

744
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,470
I'm a very loyal person. Don't worry.

745
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,170
Okay.

746
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,320
I didn't say you weren't loyal.

747
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
I was just joking.

748
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,570
Alright, we're done eating.

749
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,430
Let's go home now that we're full.

750
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,270
Let's go.

751
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,850
Sir,

752
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,870
we're leaving.

753
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,750
Okay.

754
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,410
Goodbye.

755
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,250
I've finished washing the dishes.

756
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,330
Let me wipe this.

757
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,090
I'll do it.

758
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,420
It's okay. Go play with your phone
for a bit.

759
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,660
Go wash your hands,

760
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,140
and apply some hand cream.

761
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,130
What are you up to?

762
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,090
Go.

763
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,070
Why should I wash my hands?

764
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,630
Just go.

765
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,310
They're clean now.

766
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,760
Feel them.

767
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,740
Feel what?

768
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,430
What do you want to do then?

769
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,880
What's this?

770
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,130
So sudden.

771
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,440
He Suye.

772
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,070
Now that I've got you,

773
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,890
I should take responsibility for you.

774
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,070
That metal ring from before doesn't count.

775
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,940
This time I bought you a real ring.

776
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,700
You put it on the wrong finger.

777
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,440
What are you thinking?

778
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,900
It's too early to put it on that finger,
okay?

779
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,170
I thought you were proposing to me.

780
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,260
I got my hopes up for nothing.

781
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,260
No fun.

782
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,120
He Suye.

783
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,500
Even if the ring is on your middle finger,

784
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,920
you

785
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,280
are still mine, Shen Xifan's.

786
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,250
I'll take responsibility for you for the
rest of my life.

787
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,550
Are you satisfied now?

788
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,850
I am.

789
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:54,880
Is it pretty?

790
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:55,860
Sure it is.

791
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,350
Since I've given you such a
beautiful ring,

792
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,720
what reward do you have for me?

793
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,980
What do you want?

794
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,420
How about you go out with me on a trip
in a few days when the holiday comes?

795
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,500
Sure.

796
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,270
Wait, no.

797
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,700
It's Qingming Festival in a couple
of days.

798
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,060
I need to go visit

799
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,040
my mom's grave.

800
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,370
I'll go early in the morning with
my grandpa,

801
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,900
but I'll be back by evening.

802
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,560
Spend some quality time with
Professor Yu then.

803
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,640
Let's put this on the tab for now.

804
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,390
Remember to pay me back.
