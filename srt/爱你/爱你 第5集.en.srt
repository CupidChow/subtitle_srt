3
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,759
Look how delicious this is!

4
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,710
Learn from it

5
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,710
and cook for the two of us.

6
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,430
Alright.

7
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,920
What is that?

8
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,400
Correct. How. Work.

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,510
I'm back.

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,979
Why are you two staring at me like that?

11
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,810
Can't we look at you?

12
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Of course you can.

13
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,030
Why do I feel like you're acting guilty?

14
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,079
I'm not.

15
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,000
Want a late-night snack?

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
No. I'm going to go put my medicine down.

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,990
Don't you think she seems a little off?

18
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,190
Weirdly suspicious.

19
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,280
Not at all.

20
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,400
She's doing great!

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,430
Ever since she started taking traditional Chinese medicine,

22
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,230
she's been more energetic and lively.

23
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,800
Even when she said "No" just now,

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
she sounded stronger than before.

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,190
Are you dumb?

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,400
Yes.

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
I'm telling you,

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,160
she must have gotten back together with Yan.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,690
She walks like the wind now.

30
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,750
Thank you.

31
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,750
How is it?

32
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,870
This is the best seat in the house.

33
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,150
I pulled some strings to get it.

34
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,030
Right.

35
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,470
Ms. Xu does have some impressive connections.

36
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,630
Look, there are still empty tables behind.

37
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,190
Ms. Xu, you should take us out more often

38
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,360
so we can broaden our horizons.

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,190
What's wrong with you?

40
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,680
Those tables behind are clearly reserved.

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,750
It's just that the diners haven't arrived yet.

42
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,470
Oh, sure.

43
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,000
Look behind me, this one's reserved too, huh?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,710
Hey, you!

45
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,870
I have some mint candy.

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
Do you want one?

47
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,550
Since when do you eat mint candy?

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Dr. He

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
recommended it to me.

50
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,590
He said mint candy

51
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,240
won't interfere with my TCM medication,

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,350
so it's fine for me to have.

53
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,280
Your handsome TCM physician is quite nice, isn't he?

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,000
Does he know how to do massage

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,750
and acupressure?

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,480
Has he ever given you a massage?

57
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,750
I don't know.

58
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,410
I'll ask him for you next time.

59
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,649
Speaking of this TCM physician,

60
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,269
let me show you a video.

61
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,830
Let me see.

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,650
Oh, I've seen this before.

63
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,000
It's gone viral.

64
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,409
See? I wasn't lying.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,000
Doesn't he

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,920
look a lot like that actor

67
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,380
I told you about last time?

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,480
The one from "My Journey to You"?

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,310
Yes.

70
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,840
He's really very handsome.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,760
Xiangya,

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,800
do you regret rejecting him

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,430
so impulsively back then?

74
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,040
Not really.

75
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,310
He's not my type.

76
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,560
He's too much of an old scholar type.

77
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,410
No, he's not.

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm telling you, he's actually pretty fun to talk to.

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
And he even skateboards.

80
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,580
Not old school at all.

81
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:07,950
Well,

82
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,800
why don't you give it a try?

83
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,450
I really think you two are meant to be.

84
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,040
You're both doctor and patient and neighbors.

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,500
It's a double connection.

86
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,190
I just broke up not long ago.

87
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,010
But you seem to be doing really well.

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,630
I slept through so many days at home.

89
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,310
Of course I'm doing better now.

90
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,070
No.

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
I mean, after breaking up with Yan Heng,

92
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,280
you're in a much better state than before.

93
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,630
Dr. He and I are just ordinary friends.

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,750
Then just start with being friends.

95
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,190
Nope.

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,750
Right now, I have zero interest in dating.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,409
There's really no need.

98
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,750
You've already broken up.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,560
Why cling to a relationship that wasn't even worth it

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,480
and ignore all the other possibilities waiting for you?

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,190
I'm not ignoring the other possibilities.

102
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,909
I think I'd rather invest my time in myself

103
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,390
than spend it on a relationship right now.

104
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,630
Didn't I tell you?

105
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm planning to study abroad.

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
If everything goes well,

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,830
by this time next year,

108
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,360
I'll be in Switzerland.

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,390
That means the only option

110
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,220
would be a long-distance relationship,

111
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,670
and now I know

112
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,350
long-distance relationships just don't work.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,750
Do you think Xifan is interested

114
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,550
in that handsome TCM physician?

115
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,140
She seems to think highly of him.

116
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,190
Should we try to set them up?

117
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,870
But Xifan already said

118
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,800
she doesn't want to date right now.

119
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,630
That's just because she's focused on studying abroad

120
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,960
and sees him as a friend.

121
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,600
What if she realizes later and regrets it?

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
That's true.

123
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,030
Once you've been friends for a long time,

124
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,150
it's hard to change that dynamic.

125
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,340
Don't you think so?

126
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,160
Friendships that have lasted a long time

127
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
naturally have a hard-to-change dynamic.

128
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,780
♫And you are the reason♫

129

It's me.

139
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,990
Do you have time to grab a meal?

140
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,380
I have a flight back to Bei City

141
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,710
this afternoon.

142
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm already eating. Maybe next time.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,660
Was it your dad?

144
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,250
He asked me to have dinner with him.

145
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,630
Are you going?

146
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,539
No.

147
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,280
Just to be clear,

148
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,760
I'm not the one stopping you from going.

149
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,350
I didn't plan on going anyway.

150
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,550
There's nothing to talk about with him.

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,440
Actually, you could go see him.

152
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,990
Yes,

153
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,590
he made mistakes in the past,

154
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,750
but it's all in the past now.

155
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,180
Maybe it's time for you

156
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,970
to let go of the past.

157
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,180
[13 years ago]

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Why do you still insist on studying TCM?

159
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,690
I like it.

160
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,480
I've told you before,

161
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,750
you should study Western medicine

162
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,990
and pursue clinical work,

163
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,280
step by step.

164
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,510
I've already paved the way for you.

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,920
You just need to follow it,

166
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,800
and you'll gain success and fame in the future.

167
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,470
Success and fame?

168
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,110
Like you?

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,560
All these years,

170
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,950
have you ever cared about me?

171
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,290
When my mom was critically ill,

172
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,140
where were you?

173
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,330
And now, what right do you have to control me?

174
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,180
Hello.

175
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,830
Did you receive the project case study

176
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,990
I just sent you?

177
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,960
If I score 7.5

178
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
or above,

179
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,850
wouldn't that help me more?

180
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,320
Of course it would.

181
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,470
A 7.0 meets the admission requirements,

182
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,040
but if you have the ability

183
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,260
to improve your English further,

184
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,390
it'll definitely help when you intern

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,220
at hotels in other countries later.

186
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,790
Got it. Thanks.

187
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Ms. Shen,

188
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,530
could you come out for a moment?

189
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,990
Alright, I'll be in touch with you later.

190
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,920
Thanks for your help.

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,590
Alright.

192
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,290
What's the matter?

193
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,110
Are you two-timing?

194
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,110
What?

195
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,870
Who told you that?

196
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,590
Who told us?

197
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,900
So it is true?

198
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
No, it's not.

199
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,520
Look for yourself.

200
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,250
The woman in this photo is you.

201
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
And the man?

202
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,260
Who is he?

203
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,230
No wonder every time

204
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,690
I bring up Yan Heng lately,

205
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,350
you avoid eye contact.

206
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,920
I broke up with Yan Heng.

207
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,930
We actually split up a while ago.

208
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
I just haven't found the right time to tell you both.

209
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,070
Why?

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,330
Why did you break up?

211
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,700
Did he treat you badly?

212
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,280
It's just that we were together for too long,

213
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,040
and our feelings faded.

214
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,160
Besides,

215
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,050
he's been abroad all this time,

216
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,830
and we barely had

217
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,040
any common topics to talk about.

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,770
So we just ended on great terms.

219
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,380
Why didn't you tell us?

220
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,160
Doesn't it feel suffocating to keep it all to yourself?

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Actually, there's something else I want to tell you.

222
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,000
What is it? Just say it.

223
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,990
I want to study abroad

224
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,230
in Switzerland

225
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,110
for a master's in hotel management.

226
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,320
Shen Xifan, this is too sudden.

227
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,470
I wanted to go right after graduating college,

228
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,990
but back then,

229
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,510
the internship opportunity at Gunan Huating was too valuable to pass up.

230
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,080
Plus, Yan Heng didn't agree with it either.

231
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,210
Even if we agree now,

232
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,590
you can't just quit your job, right?

233
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,920
With how busy you are,

234
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
applying for a study-abroad program requires a ton of paperwork,

235
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,320
not to mention the English exams.

236
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,890
Yes.

237
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,190
Do you even have time?

238
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,510
Do you have the energy for it?

239
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,170
I've already passed my IELTS.

240
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,150
And I've hired a study-abroad agency

241
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,590
to help with my application materials.

242
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,590
If everything goes smoothly,

243
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,040
I can leave in February.

244
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,630
So you've already decided without telling us first.

245
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,280
No.

246
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,160
Think about it.

247
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,010
You're already 27.

248
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,800
By the time you return, how old will you be?

249
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,190
Let me ask you this.

250
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,110
Once you're done with your studies,

251
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,170
will you come back?

252
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,680
If you do,

253
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,610
you'll have to start job-hunting.

254
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,990
At your age, companies will consider

255
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,040
your relationship status, marriage plans,

256
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,510
whether you'll have kids,

257
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,170
maternity leave, parental leave—

258
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,690
I know exactly how these things work.

259
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,560
Also...

260
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,120
Enough.

261
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,850
I get it.

262
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,840
Why are you sitting here alone?

263
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,750
What's got you brooding?

264
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,160
I'm not brooding.

265
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,710
I'm just thinking.

266
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,280
If you keep pressing like that, even if you punch through
the Danzhong acupoint, it still won't work.

267
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,320
Come on, let's get some late-night snacks.

268
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,800
But I just had dinner.

269
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,510
Trust me.

270
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,710
The food I'm taking you to eat

271
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,200
will clear everything up.

272
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,540
Let's go.

273
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,350
The spicy hot pot is ready.

274
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,080
Thank you.

275
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,280
Be careful, it's hot.

276
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,730
Such a big bowl.

277
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,630
You should avoid spicy food while taking herbal medicine.

278
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,510
Then what's the point of having a spicy hot pot if it's not even spicy?

279
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,320
Don't rush.

280
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,450
Try the broth first.

281
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,020
Give it a taste.

282
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:20,820
How is it?

283
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,040
This white broth is so good.

284
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,870
Dr. He,

285
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
do you need

286
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,520
a really high degree to study medicine?

287
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,340
For the most part, yes.

288
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,990
Would your family

289
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,940
support you studying for so long?

290
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

291
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm thinking about studying abroad.

292
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,590
Actually,

293
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,830
ever since I was a child,

294
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,510
I've followed a set path—

295
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,160
I've been listening to my parents

296
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,560
getting into a local university,

297
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,920
majoring in management as they wanted,

298
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,080
and now, securing a stable job.

299
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,200
But to be honest,

300
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,160
I feel really lost.

301
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,930
I want to study abroad.

302
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,980
I want to go out and see the world.

303
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,110
Only then will I really know

304
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,400
what I want.

305
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,250
But after discussing it with my family,

306
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,710
they brought up so many practical concerns,

307
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,300
and now

308
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,590
I'm starting to waver.

309
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,470
What?

310
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,970
Do you also think I shouldn't go?

311
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,780
No,

312
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,690
I just thought of a friend of mine.

313
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,630
She also studied abroad.

314
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,470
She knew exactly what she wanted,

315
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,680
so she left without hesitation.

316
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,110
That's amazing.

317
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,230
I envy her.

318
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,870
Everyone goes through

319
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,320
a phase like this—

320
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,300
feeling lost, feeling unsure.

321
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,700
It's completely normal.

322
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,330
I really admire you.

323
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,190
You've been working for so long,

324
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,540
yet you haven't let the pressure

325
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,110
crush you into staying in place.

326
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,360
You still have your own curiosity and passion.

327
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,150
That's rare.

328
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,830
Are you serious?

329
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,640
Yes.

330
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,160
To be honest,

331
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,880
when I was in school,

332
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,310
I also had huge conflicts

333
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,160
with my family over my major.

334
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,450
My mom and grandfather practiced TCM,

335
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,960
while my dad was a Western doctor.

336
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,200
And they had major disagreements

337
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,270
on whether I should study

338
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,950
Chinese or Western medicine.

339
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,430
So why did you choose TCM in the end?

340
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,710
Because of my mom.

341
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,990
She

342
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,400
passed away from breast cancer.

343
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,290
Before she died, she suffered terribly

344
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,560
from the side effects of chemotherapy.

345
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,510
But Chinese medicine

346
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,360
can help alleviate that suffering.

347
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,120
So I chose TCM.

348
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,710
It created a huge rift

349
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,070
between me and my dad,

350
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,600
but

351
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,750
in the end, I found a career

352
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,840
I truly love.

353
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
I can already picture it.

354
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,990
In a dozen years,

355
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll become like my grandfather—

356
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,000
a contented old TCM physician,

357
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,160
mentoring students, savoring tea,

358
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,490
and enjoying a life of quiet fulfillment.

359
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,470
But back to you,

360
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,710
you have two choices

361
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,770
in front of you now.

362
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,510
Either follow their path for a stable life,

363
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,510
or take a leap and try something new.

364
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,310
Look at me.

365
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,700
Working in the oncology department, I meet many patients every day.

366
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,680
Before the end of their lives,

367
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,960
they always count the regrets

368
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,360
they've had in this life.

369
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
That's why I think

370
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,850
you should go for it.

371
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,900
What if it turns out to be everything you hoped for?

372
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well…

373
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,820
Thank you for your guidance, Dr. He.

374
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,050
What guidance?

375
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,510
My 31 years of life

376
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,370
have just boiled down to nothing but a bowl of chicken soup.

377
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,500
Try it, don't be shy.

378
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,300
Alright, then I'll take a big sip.

379
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,680
Tastes good, right?

380
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
Not bad.

381
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,200
Dr. He,

382
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,310
you really know how to pick a place.

383
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,880
Right?

384
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,500
Next time you find a good spot, remember to invite me.

385
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,230
Absolutely.

386
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,710
Look.

387
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,070
We often make these little cards

388
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,840
and fold towels

389
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,890
into fun shapes for kids at the hotel.

390
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,000
This way, when they're feeling down,

391
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,420
seeing these will lift their spirits.

392
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
No wonder you're so good at origami.

393
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,490
The registration slip.

394
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
Now I remember.

395
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,840
I just folded it casually.

396
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,880
Actually,

397
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,030
hotel management has a lot of depth to it.

398
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,620
I remember when I first graduated from university,

399
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,600
one of my mom's colleagues said to her,

400
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,780
"Hey,

401
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,550
how come your daughter graduated from college

402
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,010
just to become a janitor?"

403
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,550
My mom was really upset

404
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,550
and argued with them for a long time.

405
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,070
But she still supported your job,

406
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,730
didn't she?

407
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,920
She did.

408
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,270
So,

409
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,800
you're still quite fortunate.

410
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,820
I can tell.

411
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,980
They all love you very much.

412
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,710
I've thought it through.

413
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,440
I understand your concerns.

414
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
This time, I'm applying to

415
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
a top-three global university.

416
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,730
It's very challenging,

417
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,600
but I still want to give it a try.

418
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,030
If I fail,

419
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,290
then I'll accept it and let go of the idea.

420
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,320
Why isn't he responding to me?

421
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,070
You should study Western medicine

422
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,270
and pursue clinical work,

423
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,650
step by step.

424
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,810
You just need to follow the path,

425
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,590
and you'll gain success and fame in the future.

426
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,470
All these years,

427
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,090
have you ever cared about me?

428
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,160
When my mother was critically ill,

429
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,500
where were you?

430
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,360
He Suye.

431
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,640
What's wrong?

432
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,630
♫We are miles away♫

433
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,760
I have great news to tell you.

434
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
What is it? You seem so happy.

435
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,960
My parents agreed to let me study abroad.

436
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,920
Really? Congratulations then!

437
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,360
I texted you the moment I found out,

438
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,790
but you didn't reply.

439
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,690
I was skateboarding and didn't check my phone.

440
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,020
But if I had seen it,

441
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,850
I definitely would've replied.

442
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,200
Looks like you're too excited to sleep.

443
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:12,780
♫Away, away, away from me♫

444
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,880
A little.

445
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,200
Well then,

446
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,010
let me take you somewhere.

447
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,090
♫Away from me♫

448
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's go.

449
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,690
Want to play some music?

450
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,440
How about

451
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,270
we roll down the window instead?

452
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:14,970
Sure.

453
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:47,300
♫So I wait and wander, but the outcome isn't so bad♫

454
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,680
Didn't you say you were taking me out for a ride?

455
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,480
But if there's not even a breeze,

456
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,830
♫Sparrows gather on the windowsill, sunlight streaming through♫

457
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,520
can it really count as a ride?

458
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:02,640
♫Poets keep altering words to record the fast-changing world♫

459

♫A fleeting romance, yet you won't give me an answer♫

♫Because of you, even my smile brightens up♫

470
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Why did you bring me to the lakeside?

471
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,000
Back when I first started working,

472
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,920
whenever I felt down

473
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,540
or frustrated,

474
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,840
I'd come here alone.

475
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,310
To take a walk

476
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,940
and space out a bit.

477
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,290
At night, it's especially quiet here,

478
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,680
perfect for sitting alone

479
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,540
and reflecting on your emotions.

480
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,990
But once the sun rises,

481
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,610
this place will become lively again.

482
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,440
It's as if

483
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,610
everything

484
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,960
always returns to its course.

485
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,710
Thank you

486
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,660
for keeping me company

487
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,880
so late at night.

488
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,230
It created a huge rift

489
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,680
between me and my dad,

490
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,120
but...

491
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,990
But she still supported your job,

492
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:30,750
didn't she?

493
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,360
She did.

494
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,230
So,

495
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,720
you're still quite fortunate.

496
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,750
I can tell.

497
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,080
They all love you very much.

498
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,920
What's wrong?

499
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,210
Is it because of your family?

500
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,440
Well...

501
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,900
Do you want to talk about it?

502
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
My situation is quite complicated.

503
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,450
It's not something I can explain in a short time.

504
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,300
He Suye.

505
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,700
Let's watch the sunrise together.

506
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,950
Sure.

507
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,660
Let's watch the sunrise.

508
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,270
Let's watch the sunrise.

509
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,250
It's almost time.

510
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,630
The day is about to break.

511
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,770
♫We are miles away♫

512
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,810
Breakfast is here.

513
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,270
There's one with sugar and one without.

514
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,470
Which one do you want?

515
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,190
I'll have

516
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,370
the one with sugar.

517
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:47,140
♫Away, away, away from me♫

518
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,000
Here you are.

519
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,310
Thank you.

520
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,140
♫Away from me♫

521
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
I didn't expect us

522
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,200
to sit here all night.

523
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:01,440
♫Away from me♫

524
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,320
The sun is about to rise.

525
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,940
♫We found each other♫

526
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,230
Dawn is about to break.

527
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,500
♫But we've been miles apart♫

528
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,720
Cheers.

529
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,440
Enjoy the sunrise.

530
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:29,040
♫And I don't think it's fair♫

531
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,710
Look, the sun is coming up.

532
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,270
It's beautiful.

533
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:43,290
♫And I don't think it's fair♫

534
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:51,570
[Autumn]

535
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,550
It still feels a bit chilly.

536
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,170
Let's order some bubble tea later.

537
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:06,900
Sounds good.

538
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,450
Alright.

539
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,860
Coming.

540
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll be right there.

541
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,600
Manager Shen.

542
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
Mr. Ding said he lost something.

543
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,140
Hello, Mr. Ding.

544
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,080
I'm Shen Xifan, the Front Office manager.

545
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,880
I heard you lost something valuable. Is that true?

546
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:14,600
Hello.

547
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,020
It wasn't lost;

548
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,400
it was stolen.

549
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,040
Could you tell me what exactly is missing?

550
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,230
My wedding ring.

551
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,320
Sorry.

552
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
It's my wedding ring.

553
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,960
I woke up this morning, freshened up,

554
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,470
then went to have breakfast.

555
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,400
After that, I took a call

556
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,710
in the garden

557
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,440
before heading back to my room.

558
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,850
That's when the ring disappeared.

559
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,440
During that time,

560
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,640
no one else came into the room,

561
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,550
except for her.

562
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,940
Manager Shen, I didn't steal anything.

563
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
I wouldn't dare.

564
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,160
Mr. Ding, please rest assured.

565
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,120
If our staff acted inappropriately

566
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,070
while cleaning,

567
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,730
we will deal with it strictly.

568
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,960
Well,

569
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,990
may I ask where you last saw

570
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,920
your ring?

571
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
On the bathroom counter.

572
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,790
Contact the Works Department

573
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,160
and have them dismantle the bathroom pipes

574
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,090
for inspection.

575
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,030
Got it.

576
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,200
Mr. Ding,

577
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,070
may I ask if you were wearing your ring

578
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,470
while having breakfast?

579
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,160
Didn't I already say it?

580
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,600
I freshened up and went to breakfast.

581
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,680
Then, after taking a call

582
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,140
in the garden,

583
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,070
I came back to my room.

584
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,920
When I entered the room, I found the ring was gone.

585
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,790
Do you have any idea how important this ring is to me?

586
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,680
It's not just a symbol

587
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,760
of my love with my wife,

588
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,030
but also a lifelong promise to her.

589
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,710
Never to be lost!

590
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,060
Even the Maybach she gave me

591
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,700
isn't as important as this wedding ring.

592
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,030
You understand, right?

593
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,460
What are you standing there for? Find!

594
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,480
Take good care of Mr. Ding.

595
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,810
The water's gone cold.

596
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,400
My apologies.

597
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,690
I'm very sorry, Mr. Ding,

598
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,890
that we couldn't provide you with the best stay this time.

599
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,950
It's fine. I was just in a bad mood.

600
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,270
Sorry about that.

601
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,290
Not at all.

602
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,290
But that Shen...

603
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,030
Manager Shen

604
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,320
is a good person.

605
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,150
Thank you.

606
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,370
Your recognition is the biggest encouragement for her.

607
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,710
We'll continue improving our service

608
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,020
and hope to provide you

609
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,710
with a perfect stay next time.

610
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,280
The ring has been found.

611
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,010
I'll stay here again next time.

612
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,380
See you.

613
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,140
He obviously lost it himself

614
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,840
yet made such a big fuss.

615
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Good thing it was lost in the garden.

616
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,470
If it had been on the way to the restaurant,

617
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:09,130
we'd have had to turn over the entire hotel lawn.

618
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,590
Also, good thing Manager Shen rushed straight into the rain.

619
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,320
That helped calm Mr. Ding down.

620
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,770
And she actually found the ring.

621
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,110
Where's Manager Shen?

622
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,180
She got drenched, so I told her to shower and change.

623
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,380
She deserves a bonus.

624
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,250
We'll talk about it later.

625
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,850
What do you mean by "we'll talk about it later"?

626
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,240
Xifan.

627
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,840
What's wrong?

628
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,030
I just got my period. My stomach hurts.

629
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,690
So it's the first day, and you got caught in the rain too.

630
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,480
I'll make you some ginger tea.

631
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,440
No need.

632
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,670
Do you have any painkillers?

633
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,800
I've run out of mine.

634
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,800
How about I just request leave for you?

635
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,760
No.

636
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,110
I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

637
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,960
No worries.

638
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,890
Alright.

639
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,280
I'll go get it for you.

640
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,360
You two have such different tastes.

641
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,220
Do you two enjoy eating together?

642
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,280
She's just a friend.

643
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,380
Oh, sorry.

644
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,820
I remember you. You often come to buy my breakfast.

645
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,030
But you've never tried

646
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,070
my spicy hot pot, right?

647
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,440
That's right.

648
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Give it a good try today.

649
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,900
See if it suits your taste.

650
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,700
Take your time.

651
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,840
-Add more if it's not enough.
-Thank you.

652
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,960
This spicy hot pot stall

653
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,030
is the cleanest and most hygienic one on this street.

654
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,030
You should try it.

655
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
So you like eating spicy hot pot.

656
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,150
Spicy hot pot

657
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,960
is a very magical food.

658
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,150
As long as the broth is good,

659
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,410
anything you dip in it will be delicious.

660
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,510
What's that look for?

661
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,880
TCM physicians can't skateboard,

662
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,280
and now they can't eat spicy hot pot either?

663
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,110
I just thought,

664
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,930
aren't TCM physicians usually into light flavors?

665
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,120
They probably wouldn't eat something

666
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,060
so salty, oily, and spicy.

667
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,710
Then what should I be eating?

668
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,530
Plain congee with side dishes,

669
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,170
maybe some vegetarian food too.

670
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,960
You sure have a lot of stereotypes about TCM physicians.
