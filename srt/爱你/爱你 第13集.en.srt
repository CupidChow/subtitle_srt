00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,640
Previously, I...

4
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,039
I felt it wasn't the right time yet,

5
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,110
so I didn't tell you explicitly.

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,840
There were also too many people last night.

7
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,060
I was afraid you'd be embarrassed

8
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,390
so didn't express myself clearly either.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
But,

10
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,680
I can say it again more formally.

11
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
Shen Xifan,

12
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,660
I like you.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,360
I don't have any plans to be in a relationship right now.

15
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,910
So, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,310
Wait.

17
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,780
I thought we were getting along well.

18
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm about to study abroad.

19
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
I've said before,

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,160
I don't plan to be in a relationship before going abroad.

21
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
It's fine. While you study abroad, I can stay here...

22
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,420
I might have given you the wrong impression.

23
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,150

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,690

Okay.

I've refilled your medicine for you.

33
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,200
The hangover medicine.

34
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,670
Remember to boil it before drinking.

35
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,920
Remember to take your medicine on time.

43

It's such a big bag.

44
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,280
Is it Chinese medicine?

Ms. Shen.

51
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,400
Did Dr. He prescribed you Chinese medicine again?

52
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,430
You should have invited him to come over to our place.

you were drinking with Dr. He.

56
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,220
He was the one who sent you back.

57

I suppose he did send me back.

59

If I knew, why would I set up those blind dates for you?

61

Dr. He looks so gentle and polite.

62
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,630
He must like soft-spoken

63

and elegant girls.

64
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,010
Don't drink in front of him anymore.

65
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,000
What stage are you two at now?

66
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,870
What do you mean by "what stage"?

67
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,159
You know, what stage of the relationship?

68
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,920
We don't have any stage.

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,270
Last night, when Dr. He

70
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,560
sent you back,

71
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
I could feel he has feelings for you.

72
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,550
He took such good care of you.

73
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,750
I turned him down.

74
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,600
Why?

75
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,510
Because I'm going to study abroad.

76
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,540
I don't want to be in a relationship before I go study abroad.

77
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,310
It's not even certain if you can go yet.

78
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,070
Besides, it doesn't matter if you go abroad.

79
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, long-distance relationships, online relationships,

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,070
and all kinds of relationships are possible now.

81
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,830
Relationships and studying abroad are two separate things.

82
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,070
They don't interfere with each other.

83
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,130
They do interfere.

84
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,870
I've already been through a long-distance relationship before.

85
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,930
Before I go abroad,

86
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
I don't want to be in a relationship.

87
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,659
I've refilled your medication for you.

88
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,870
The hangover medicine.

Remember to take your medicine on time.

91
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,290
I heard that

92
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,370
during dinner on Friday,

93
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,520
that handsome TCM doctor confessed his feelings to you.

94
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,270
He said you drank too much,

95
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,120
so that handsome TCM doctor even sent you home.

96
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,850
So, what happened afterwards?

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,130
Didn't he tell you that

98
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,900
I turned down Dr. He?

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Why?

100
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,910
Because before I go abroad to study,

101
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,550
I don't plan to be in a relationship in the first place.

102
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,270
So when he confessed to me,

103
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I rejected him.

104
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm already 27 years old.

105
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,720
Before making any decision,

106
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,960
I should be a bit more rational.

107
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,430
Moreover,

108
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,660
it's been proven

109
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,150
that I really can't handle a long-distance relationship.

110
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,600
Just like what happened with Yan Heng before.

111
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,010
I'm afraid that one day he might regret it

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,510
and realize

113
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,840
that I'm not as good as he imagined.

114
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,670
There's no major issues.

115
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,320
Just the format of the table of contents could be optimized a bit more.

116

Thank you, Senior He.

117
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,190

118
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,120
Manager Shen rejected Suye.

119
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,920
It's true.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,400
I couldn't tell during the morning rounds.

121
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,960
His confession got rejected,

122
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,720
yet he still has to focus on work.

123
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,380
If it were me, I wouldn't even be able to even eat.

124
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,640
But

125
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,800
why did Manager Shen reject Senior He?

126
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,440
I don't know.

127
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,550
A couple of days ago,

128
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,010
I even saw Manager Shen at Senior He's place.

129
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,960
I thought they

130
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,870
were just a step away from getting together.

131
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,710
Who knew

132
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
things would take such a sudden turn for the worse?

133
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
Let's eat.

134
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,930
Then we won't disturb your meal.

They gave me a cup of oolong tea for free.

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,940
Thanks.

142

That's perfect, I don't need to brew tea now.

143
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,490
It smells good.

144
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,190
How is it?

145
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,380
It's actually quite good.

146
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,370
What flavour did you get?

147
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,560
Mine is brown sugar ginger milk tea.

148
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,230
Brown sugar ginger milk tea?

149
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,080
You girls all like to drink these

150
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,540
so-called ginger-infused hot drinks, huh?

151
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,550
The weather has been getting colder lately,

152
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,240
so I just wanted to drink something hot.

153
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Actually, whether there's ginger in it to ward off the cold

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,240
isn't really that important.

155
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
What we're drinking is the mood.

156
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,870
The mood?

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
To put it bluntly,

158
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,550
we need the sugar in the bubble tea

159
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,200
to stimulate dopamine secretion in the brain

160
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
to make ourselves feel a bit better.

161
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,130
That's quite interesting.

162
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,010
Drinking too much bubble tea can make you gain weight.

163
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,200
When you want to lose weight, you'll be in a bad mood.

164
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,030
But usually,

165
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,320
you like to drink bubble tea

166
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,670
to switch up your mood.

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't you find that contradictory?

168
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,170
Now you can order bubble tea with sugar substitutes,

169
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,470
so it's not that bad.

170
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,410
Sugar substitutes are...

171
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,510
They're considered

172
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,200
a substitutionary satisfaction.

173
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,280
It means you're not actually consuming sugar,

174
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,610
but you get psychological satisfaction.

175
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,860
And it tastes much better than sugar-free options.

176
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,310
Substitutionary satisfaction.

177
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,080
See.

178
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,510
After repeated discussions and studies within the institute,

179
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,400
we may have to suspend

180
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,280
your research on breast cancer.

181
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,150
I know.

182
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,570
The project was initially approved,

183
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,610
allowing you to lead students in research for a while, then suspended.

184
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,590
It's a waste of your effort.

185
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,150
I tried my best to advocate for you too,

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,500
but there's nothing we can do.

187
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,390
As you know,

188
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,120
the institute's annual research funding is limited.

189
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,600
The amount allocated to oncology is also limited.

190
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,330
The institute certainly hopes that this funding

191
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,620
can be used on projects

192
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,760
that are more likely to yield results.

193
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,400
I understand.

194
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,300
For the past three years, you've been persisting

195
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,100
in researching palliative care

196
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,300
and I admire you for that.

197
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,480
But this direction is indeed too niche

198
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,540
and it's not easy to produce results.

199
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,850
I hope you can

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,560
understand the institute's decision.

201
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,010
Next year.

202
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,540
Next year, I will do my utmost

203
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,460
to keep your research project.

204
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,390
Alright.

205
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,070
Thank you, Director.

206
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,870
If there's nothing else,

207
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,130
I'll head back to the outpatient clinic.

208
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,320
Heat up the Chinese medicine yourself, okay?

209
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,360
I'll drink it in a couple of days.

210
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,760
Why won't you drink it?

211
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,550
It's already been prescribed, hasn't it?

212
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,350
That's He's heartfelt gesture.

213
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,260
I get it.

214
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,000
I want to go downstairs for a walk.

215
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,470
After you two are done cleaning up, get some rest early.

216
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,730
Come back early, okay?

217
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,740
Be careful, it's cold out there.

218
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,910
Don't worry, I'm heading down now.

219
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Why aren't you wearing socks in this cold weather?

220
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,660
I was just planning to go downstairs for a stroll,

221
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,609
so I forgot about it.

222
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:27,950
Sure.

223
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,980
I just got back from working overtime.

224
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,680
So you...

225
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,940
You must be tired from working overtime.

226
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,540
Well, I'll head home now.

227
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,790

He Suye.

249
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,110
Go ahead, tell me.

250
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,070
Why are you so troubled?

251
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,000
Not going to talk?

252
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,590
It's up to you whether you want to talk or not.

253
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,050
I can figure it out with a bit of calculation.

254
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,200
Is it related to Miss Shen?

255
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,400
I just feel that she...

256
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,460
is a bit heartless.

257
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,760
To be honest,

258
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,870
I'm starting to doubt

259
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,480
if I'm being too presumptuous.

260
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,370
You know,

261
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,160
you finally like a girl,

262
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
but you can't force it.

263
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,800
If it doesn't work out, let it go.

264
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,930
After all, you're over thirty.

265
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,080
Don't make things difficult for yourself.

266
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,960
Do you understand?

267
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
I understand.

268
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,840
Let me pour you some more.

[Front Office Manager]

270
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,820
The scent is gone.

271
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,450
[Congratulations on your offer]

272
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,310
It seems we still have to part ways.

273
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,120
I made the right decision,

274
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,100
didn't I?

275
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,930
Drink this tangerine peel water before you go back.

276
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,000
Why?

277
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,850
You've been preoccupied with Miss Shen's matter

278
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,650
qnd weren't focused on eating.

279
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm worried you might have indigestion.

280
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,140
Drink some tangerine peel water.

281
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
It helps with digestion and relieves stagnation.

282
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,710
[Winter]

283
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,070
Isn't this heater a bit too small?

284
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,880
Will it be enough?

285
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,730
Although this heater is relatively small,

286
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,450
its effect is very good.

287
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,400
It will definitely be warm enough for winter.

288
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,270
Okay, let's plug it in then.

289
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,930
Alright, shall we put it here?

290
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,300
This was knocked off earlier while making the bedding.

291
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,990
This is...

292
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,240
When we were tidying up the room just now,

293
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,480
we accidentally knocked it over.

294
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,930
Where should it be placed?

295
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,730
Give it to me, I'll eat it later.

296
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,140
Since winter is approaching,

297
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,870
we've changed your bedding to something warmer.

298
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,270
It's humid in these mountains, isn't it?

299
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,130
So we applied for a heater for you.

300
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,550
If you need anything else,

301
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,950
you can always come to me.

302
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,390
Did you not rest well recently?

303
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,510
You looked rosy just a few days ago,

304
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,850
but today you seem a bit haggard.

305
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,240
Is it because

306
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,700
you're a bit tired?

307
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,240
I've been having some insomnia.

308
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,600
Then you must be having something on your mind.

309
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,470
Come, come. Sit down and chat with me.

310
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,480
I made a decision,

311
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,100
but I'm not happy about it.

312
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,270
I'm wondering

313
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,460
if I made a mistake.

314
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,310
In this world,

315
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,550
there's no absolute right or wrong.

316
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,290
It's only about whether you regret it or not.

317
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,090
If you're having insomnia,

318
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,640
could it be that you're feeling some regret?

319
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,610
I...

320
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
I shouldn't be regretting it, should I?

321
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,140
Life is like the clouds in the sky.

322
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,090
Gathering and parting are all destined.

323
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
If it's meant to be,

324
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,270
even if they turn into rain,

325
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
they will

326
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,940
fall into the same lake.

327
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,070
Do you know how to play?

328
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,350
It's lagging, it's lagging.

329
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,330
I'm still better at this, right?

330
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,240
How do I jump?

331
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,810
Press this, press this.

332
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,760
When are you coming back this year?

333
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,490
I'm coming back tomorrow.

334
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,750
Have you booked your flight?

335
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,550
Yes, I'll arrive in the evening.

336
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,890
Do you want me to send a car to pick you up?

337
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,560
No need,

338
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,440
I can take a taxi myself.

339
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,650
By the way,

340
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,330
Auntie Wang

341
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,790
is also coming to spend the New Year with us.

342
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,410
Just wanted to let you know.

343
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,430
Okay.

344
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,160
Hanging up now.

345
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,200
I was just thinking

346
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,550
that you rejected Dr. He too harshly.

347
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,070
I didn't expect that

348
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,470
you've already received the offer so soon.

349
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,070
Have you told him?

350
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,040
About receiving the offer.

351
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,070
I know.

352
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,370
It's not just because of the long-distance relationship between you two.

353
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,640
Your previous relationship

354
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,170
still casts a big shadow over you, doesn't it?

355
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,640
But, Shen Xifan,

356
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,550
finding someone who genuinely cares for you

357
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,610
is not easy.

358
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,550
Can you stop pushing him away

359
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,050
over and over?

360
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,980
It's like how I kept pushing and pulling with Lin Yishen.

361
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,780
In the end, we missed our chance.

362
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,750
Do you think we are

363
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,240
still friends now?

364
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,790
What are you doing?

365
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,310
Li Jie just told me

366
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,590
that he's at the handsome TCM doctor's place.

367
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,510
We'll go there now.

368
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,510
You need to clear things up with him.

369
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,650
I don't want to.

370
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,640
What should I

371
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,340
even say?

372
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,610
Say anything.

373
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,190
At least tell him that you do care about him.

374
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,770
Do you know what the most crucial part is?

375
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,640
It's not that you didn't tell him about it,

376
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,830
it's that he feels as if

377
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,590
you don't care about his feelings at all.

378
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,000
Even if you two are just platonic friends,

379
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,550
you went through this matter together.

380
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,150
You shouldn't exclude him completely, right?

381
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,850
Where are you guys?

382
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,370
We're at Suye's place.

383
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,980
Can I come and join you?

384
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,790
Let me ask first.

385
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,440
Fang.

386
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,270
What are you doing here?

387
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,930
Go sit down.

388
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,590
It's okay, Senior He. I'll help you.

389
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,830
We can't have guests cooking for us.

390
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,200
Really, it's fine.

391
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,880
Go get some drinks from the fridge for them.

392
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,640
Hurry, go on.

393
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,680
Alright then.

394
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,110
Suye.

395
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,720
Manager Xu from the hotel.

396
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,990
You remember her, right?

397
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,320
She says she's nearby.

398
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,840
She wants to come over.

399
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,480
Is she alone?

400
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,840
She might be with Manager Shen.

401
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,640
Should I...

402
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,300
It's fine, just tell them to come over together.

403
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,680
Okay, I'll reply to them then.

404
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,210
Go ahead.

405
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,659
Go up that way.

406
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
How do I get there?

407
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:24,900
You lead the way.

408
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,639
Would you like a drink?

409
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,290
Yes.

410
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,420
We're out of the elevator now.

411
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,440
Xiangya, I haven't figured out

412
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,110
how to put it yet.

413
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,040
Let's forget it.

414
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,750
We're already here.

415
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,250
But I really...

416
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,820
Please come in.

417
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,120
I've put the slippers here for you.

418
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,320
Put on the slippers and sit with them for a while.

419
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
I'll go prepare the meal.

420
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Please, have a seat.

421
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,230
This game!

422
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm really good at this.

423
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,030
You can play this?

424
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,960
I can't get past this part. You try.

425
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,190
Let's play together.

426
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,630
Here it comes.

427
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,630
Perilla cucumber carrot soup.

428
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,960
Looks impressive.

429
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,440
The main event.

430
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,320
It looks so delicious.

431
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,710
It's good for dispelling cold. Try some.

432
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,360
Have a bowl.

433
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,400
Is it for cooling down or warming up?

434
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,320
Warming up.

435
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,960
Okay.

436
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,360
I'll try some of that lotus root.

437
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:08,800
Be careful, it's hot.

438
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,630
Is it good?

439
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,670
Is it tasty?

440
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,320
Mm, it's delicious.

441
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,880
He wants some too.

442
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,670
Have some more soup.

443
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,470
That's enough, that's enough.

444
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,280
Here you go.

445
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,000
Thank you.

446
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,970
Is this shredded potato or...

447
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,700
I don't know.

448
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,030
I want one too.

449
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,630
Is it good?

450
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,790
How is it?

451
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:19,550
It's good, right?

452
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,750
It tastes so healthy.

453
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,880
It's incredibly delicious.

454
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,280
Tasty, isn't it?

455
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,150
Tissue, tissue, tissue!

456
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,010
What happened?

457
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,480
Wipe it off.

458
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,360
Thanks.

459
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,440
If the tissue doesn't clean it completely,

460
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,570
do you want to try a stain removal pen?

461
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,800
It's delicious.

462
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,320
There's one next to the washing machine in the storage room.

463
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,120
Okay.

464
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,060
I'll go get it then.

466
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,380
The radish flavour is strong.

467
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
It's really tasty.

468
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,020
Senior He,

469
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,200
do you have any chili sauce?

470
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,070
Personally...

471
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,480
Yes, I do.

472
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,320
...I'd like to improve it a bit.

473
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,670
I think it's at...

474
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,550
I'll go get it.

475
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,600
The flavour is a bit mild.

476
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,670
I'd like to make it a bit stronger.

477
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,930
What do you want to add?

478
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Manager Shen.

479
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,150
Senior He used to have a girlfriend.

480
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,480
Have you heard about it?

481
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,200
I haven't heard about that.

482
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,030
They were college classmates.

483
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,130
They dated for about...

484
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,350
about five or six years, I think.

485
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,960
Eventually, it was because

486
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
the girlfriend got an opportunity to study abroad.

487
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,530
So she broke up with Senior He.

488
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,560
And after she left, she never came back.

489
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,760
What's wrong?

490
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,580
Do you also think I shouldn't go study abroad?

491
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,230
No, that's not it.

492
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
I just suddenly thought of a friend of mine.

493
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,900
She also went abroad to study.

494
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,820
Senior He was depressed for a long time because of that.

495
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,050
So, you...

496
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,960
I want to say...

497
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,730
If you really don't like him,

498
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,480
stop leading him on.

499
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,210
Ever since you rejected Senior He,

500
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,320
he's been in low spirits

501
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,030
and preoccupied with worries.

502
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,830
Today you even came to his house.

503
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,710
Do you want to see

504
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,330
how upset and heartbroken he is because of you?

505
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,190
Or are you trying to prove how charming you are?

506
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,320
Senior He has always been a gentle

507
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,300
and kind person.

508
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,360
But that doesn't mean

509
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,150
you can treat him so casually.

510
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,580
If you really don't like him,

511
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,230
please stop bothering him.

512
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,880
The situation between He Suye and me

513
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,510
might be a bit complicated.

514
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,710
But you're right.

515
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,950
I held him back.

516
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,290
Thank you for reminding me.

517
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,870
The elevator is here.

518
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,130
Be careful on your way.

519
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,670
Goodbye, Senior He.

520
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,800
Goodbye, Senior He.

521
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,190
Goodbye.

522
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,630
Fang.

523
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,030
Could you stay for a moment?

524
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,630
I have something to tell you.

525
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,730
You guys go ahead, it's fine.

526
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,570
Bye bye.

527
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,500
Bye bye, bye bye.

528
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,280
Senior He,

529
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,670
Xiao Fang.

531
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I was told

532
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,960
by my grandfather to supervise your internship.

533
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,410
You are my student,

534
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,400
but,

535
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,690
you're also just my student.

536
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,620
Next semester,

537
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,590
you won't need to intern under me anymore.

538
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,100
You are an excellent student,

539
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,420
very diligent and intelligent.

540
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
I believe

541
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,660
you will definitely achieve great things in your studies.

542
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,470
You don't need to rush to answer now.

543
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,510
Think it over when you get back.

544
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,860
Be careful on your way home.

545
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll be going now.

546
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,310
When you went downstairs just now,

547
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,840
did you catch up with Xifan?

548
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,050
No.

549
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:45,650
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought her.

550
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,930
It's not your fault.

551
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,410
Did she tell you what's on her mind?

552
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:54,070
What do you mean?

553
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,320
She's been in a lot of pain since she rejected you.

554
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,230
She's been very conflicted.

555
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,440
Conflicted for days.

556
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,880
The reason for her conflict

557
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,400
is because she cares about you.

558
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,760
She's afraid of rushing into a relationship with you,

559
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,670
and then immediately being in different countries.

560
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,440
If conflicts arise,

561
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,610
there won't even be a chance to communicate.

562
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,670
In the end, you might not even be able to remain friends.

563
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:26,390
These words,

564
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,090
why doesn't she say them herself?

565
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,210
Actually, Xifan's romantic experiences

566
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,510
are very limited.

567
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,530
She only had one first love that lasted seven years.

568
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,150
They broke up just last year.

569
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,550
They were in a long-distance relationship for a long time.

570
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,480
During the last period, she was in a really bad state.

571
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,970
She's very afraid of getting hurt again.

572
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,840
Later, it was because

573
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,700
the girlfriend got an opportunity to study abroad,

574
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,760
so she broke up with Senior He.

575
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,520
And after she left, she never came back.

576
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,240
I love you too much.

577
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,550
That's why I didn't realize you've always been so selfish.

578
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:32,430
You studying abroad

579
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,760
will cause so much trouble for those around you.

580
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,620
How come I'm only realising how selfish you are now?

581
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,800
Senior He has always been a very gentle

582
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,880
and kind person.

583
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,960
But that doesn't mean

584
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,630
you can treat him so casually.
