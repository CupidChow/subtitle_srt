00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,370
It's so stingy of you

175
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,060
to just make these few dishes.

176
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,690
Totally unacceptable!

177
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,440
Look, my grandpa is scolding me.

178
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,720
He thinks I'm not treating you

179
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,450
well enough.

180
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,590
Then…

181
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Explain it to him.

182
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,420
You want me to explain?

183
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,270
What am I supposed to say?

184
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,960
Anything. No pressure.

185
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,790
Well,

186
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,160
should I call him Grandpa

187
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,070
or Professor Yu?

188
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
Professor Yu will do. Relax.

189
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,950
Professor Yu, hello.

190
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,020
I'm Shen.

191
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,470
I asked He Suye to cook at home

192
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,740
because I think his cooking is amazing,

193
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,100
better than anything from a restaurant.

194
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,440
Take your phone back.

195
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay.

196
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,610
You heard that?

197
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
My cooking is amazing,

198
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,720
and I treat her very well.

199
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,860
That's just how my grandpa is.

200
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,880
I was so nervous.

201
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,010
What's there to be nervous about?

202
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
What did he say?

203
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,310
He feels bad

204
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,600
and thinks he might've left a bad impression on you.

205
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,330
No way. Why would he think that?

206
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,990
That's just how he is—

207
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,230
tough on the outside but soft on the inside.

208
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,560
He's loved roasting me since I was little.

209
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,360
But honestly, he really likes you.

210
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,630
I've only

211
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,560
met him once.

212
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,260
Why does he like me already?

213
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,920
You two met

214
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,120
during your first follow-up visit.

215
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,120
He was covering for me at the clinic.

216
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,720
When he got back, he told me,

217
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,920
"Miss Shen is really pretty."

218
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,670
Why don't you two

219
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,160
have a meal together and get to know each other?

220
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,810
Don't you think it's too soon for me

221
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,940
to meet your family?

222
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,370
It's nothing formal.

223
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,700
Well,

224
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,700
if it's just a casual meal, then sure.

225
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,030
I'm available anytime.

226
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,430
Tell Professor Yu for me

227
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,660
that I really like him too.

228
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,870
What a sweet talker.

229
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,640
No.

230
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,860
I need to reconsider.

231
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,020
If you meet my grandpa like this,

232
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,200
he's going to like you even more.

233
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,730
Then I'll fall out of favor.

234
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,390
I'll spoil you.

235
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,290
What are you watching?

236
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,480
"Twinkling Stars."

237
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Teach me origami.

238
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,200
Origami?

239
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,730
Why are you suddenly interested in that?

240
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,540
I've always wanted to learn it

241
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,940
but never got the chance.

242
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,980
So,

243
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,940
what do you want to make?

244
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,490
A frog,

245
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,190
the kind that jumps when you press it.

246
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,610
Let me tell you.

247
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,470
Making a paper frog is hard.

248
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,950
You need to watch closely.

249
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,920
How hard can it be? Just show me.

250
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,050
Alright.

251
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,690
Look.

252
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,560
Take the paper,

253
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,850
fold it like this,

254
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,430
and then fold it again like this.

255
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,940
Like this.

256
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,340
After that,

257
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,960
unfold the paper

258
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,290
and fold it in half.

259
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Fold it once more.

260
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,170
Like this.

261
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,380
Then…

262
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,160
After folding both sides,

263
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,040
fold these two corners.

264
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,440
Then fold it like this.

265
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,140
Right.

266
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,180
Then like this.

267
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,240
Done.

268
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,510
Someone

269
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,960
was so confident just now,

270
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,980
saying he could definitely get it right,

271
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,500
only to end up with this.

272
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,860
Did you mess up from the very first step?

273
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,260
How could that be?

274
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,040
That's an insult to my intelligence.

275
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,320
That's not what I mean!

276
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,340
He Suye.

277
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,160
Are you angry?

278
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,630
No.

279
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,610
Really?

280
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
I just realized something.

281
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,830
Every day I spend with you

282
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,080
makes me incredibly happy.

283
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,570
Alright then.

284
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,360
As long as you're happy,

285
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,690
you can say whatever you want about me.

286
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,560
I was just thinking…

287
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,710
Fortunately, I came to see you yesterday.

288
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,490
I know.

289
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,590
I saw you pacing outside the door.

290
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,470
You saw me?

291
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,380
I saw everything through the peephole.

292
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
I was so afraid you'd leave the next second,

293
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,340
but at the same time,

294
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,790
I didn't want to startle you by suddenly opening the door.

295
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,740
So,

296
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,980
I made up an excuse,

297
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,110
saying I needed to take out the trash.

298
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,160
I was afraid that you might reject me

299
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,440
if I said something wrong again.

300
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,170
I wouldn't. Why would I reject you?

301
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,570
Yesterday, you said

302
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,150
you had considered the worst-case scenario—

303
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,210
waiting for me to return from abroad.

304
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,570
But what if, after I come back,

305
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,990
I still haven't figured things out?

306
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Is this a trick question?

307
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm being serious.

308
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,730
If one day

309
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,590
you make me feel miserable,

310
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,590
I won't hold onto you anymore.

311
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,350
A relationship

312
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,480
is about two people.

313
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,920
Happiness and joy

314
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,770
should go both ways.

315
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,510
For me

316
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,920
and for you,

317
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,820
it should be the same.

318
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,590
So,

319
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,490
if one day

320
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,540
I make you feel miserable

321
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,810
or

322
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,480
I make you feel unhappy,

323
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,790
you have to tell me.

324
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,030
I'll make changes.

325
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,030
If…

326
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,710
that's still not enough…

327
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,430
you can break up with me.

328
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,480
What are you saying?

329
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,010
Don't say things like that.

330
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm saying this

331
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,630
because I truly want you…

332
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,030
to always be happy.

333
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,860
♫Loving you is the best thing I've ever done♫

334
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,710
♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

335

337
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,630
He Suye.

338
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,840
Fortunately, I came to see you yesterday.

339
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,320
Fortunately, you came to see me last night.

340
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,870
Fortunately, you opened the door yesterday.

341
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,740
Fortunately, I opened the door.

342
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,370

♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

346
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:39,050
♫You're like a gentle wind♫

347
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,010
I'll tell you the code to my door.

348
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,340
Okay.

349
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,170
112167.

350
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
What are those numbers?

351
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,670
It's the ISSN of the English edition of TCM Journal.

352
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,890
My first SCI paper

353
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,120
was published there.

354
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,560
That's so you.

355
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,020
Keep it in mind

356
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,640
so you can open the door yourself when you come.

357
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
I'll try my best to remember those numbers.

358
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,080
Actually, if you had left these flowers at my place,

359
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,010
you could still see them every day.

360
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,740
I'll come to see you every day.

361
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,950
A relationship

362
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,270
is about two people.

363
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,330
Happiness and joy should go both ways.

364
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,240
It's such a simple truth.

365
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,350
Why did I not understand it before?

366
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,820
You made it?

367
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,480
I searched for tutorials online. Hard work makes up for clumsiness.

368
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,680
I made that paper frog! Suye threatened me.

369
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,130
He said if I couldn't do it,

370
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,330
he wouldn't help me check the English version of my paper.

371
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,400
Keep it a secret.

372
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,990
Why did you expose him?

373
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,070
I'm too kind.

374
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,220
I couldn't stand to see you get fooled.

375
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,400
What do you need from me?

376
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,610
You got together with that TCM physician?

377
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,190
When?

378
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,880
The night before last.

379
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,070
He's just a lame TCM physician.

380
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,610
What do you see in him?

381
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,730
Yan Heng.

382
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,560
I didn't choose to be with him

383
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,370
because I saw something in him.

384
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,200
I chose him because when I'm with him,

385
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,490
I feel happy

386
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,690
and content.

387
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,429
That's something you could never give me.

388
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,409
Happiness should go both ways.

389
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,030
I wish

390
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,010
you could find the person who makes you happy.

391
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,460
You're checking out today, right?

392

393
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,630
with our service,

394

we'd love to have you stay with us again.

395
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,780
As the front office manager,

396
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,800
I'll try to offer the best service.

397
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,510
I'll get back to work now.

398
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,330
Goodbye, Mr. Yan.

399
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,150
Please, don't come again.

400
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,850
[Shen Xifan]

401
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,360
What's wrong? Why are you calling me now?

402
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,280
I miss you.

403
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,900
What's wrong? Did something happen?

404
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,090
Nothing.

405
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,670
I just want to tell you

406
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,320
that I miss you.

407
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,500
Thank you for telling me.

408
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,380
I miss you too.

409
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,020
Bye-bye.
