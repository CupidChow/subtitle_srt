[The Best Thing]

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,680
[Episode 21: Tulips]
[Bitter and pungent in taste, neutral in nature, enters the lung meridian, transforms dampness, and dispels foulness.]

3
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,840
Are you meeting us at the old house,

4
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,770
or going straight to the cemetery?

5
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,000
Something urgent came up, so I won't be going to Hang City this year.

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,040
I've ordered a bouquet of tulips to be delivered to the old house.

7
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
Bring it to Nian for me.

8
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,980
Mom.

9
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,030
Suye is here.

10
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,820
Mom.

11
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,790
What are you reading?

12
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,230
When they were stopping my bleeding earlier,

13
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,300
I suddenly thought of a TCM herb for stopping bleeding,

14
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,560
but I can't remember its name no matter how hard I try.

15
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,000
I studied TCM since I was young,

16
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
but now I can't even remember the name of a single herb.

17
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,950
It must be a side effect of the brain metastasis, right?

18
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,400
He Suye.

19
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,190
I'm glad I made it in time.

20
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Why are you here?

21
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,450
I picked these flowers for your mom.

22
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,730
I was thinking if you could give them to her for me.

23
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,970
I hope she likes them.

24
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,100
She will like them.

25
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,270
Nian,

26
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,650
He Sheng is too busy with work to come,

27
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
so I came with Suye.

28
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,310
But

29
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,000
he asked us to bring you

30
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,600
your favourite tulips.

31
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,780
Don't be disappointed, alright?

32
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,100
As for me, rest assured,

33
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm in good health.

34
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,530
This time, your son is bringing you good news.

35
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,190
Let me tell you,

36
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,790
he finally has a girlfriend.

37
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,850
Let your son properly introduce her to you.

38
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,570
Mom,

39
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,930
her name is Shen Xifan.

40
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,280
She's a very intelligent and cheerful girl.

41
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,280
I feel very happy spending time with her every day.

42
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Besides,

43
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,790
she likes flowers too.

44
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,190
She's the one

45
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,870
who chose the flowers for you this year.

46
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,180
However,

47
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,110
she has to go study abroad this year.

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,790
I'll bring her to see you two years later.

49
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,320
I hope you'll like her.

50
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,400
She will.

51
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,590
I believe your mom will definitely like her.

52
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Mom,

53
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,270
there's another piece of good news.

54
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,430
My research on breast cancer

55
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,660
is also on track now.

56
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll definitely work hard to do it well.

57
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,390
Nian, did you hear that?

58
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,370
The topic your son is researching on

59
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,270
will benefit all breast cancer patients.

60
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,830
It's to allow all patients

61
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,060
to complete their final journey

62
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,890
with dignity.

63
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,930
If you can hear us from heaven,

64
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,270
please bless your son's

65
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,300
research project with success.

66
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,950
[Beloved wife, Yu Nianxiang]

67
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,080
Stop thinking about it.

68
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,380
Your father has a new family to take care of.

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,410
It's normal that he couldn't come.

70
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,560
You brought such beautiful fresh flowers this year.

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,690
How lovely they are!

72
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,310
And such good news too.

73
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,070
I believe your mom would be very happy.

74
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,080
Miss Shen is really thoughtful.

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,250
You should thank her properly.

76
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,100
Is she on leave at home today?

77
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
She's on duty.

78
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:34,920
On duty, I see.

79
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,820
Is it convenient to give her a call then?

80
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,380
Let me ask her.

81
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,659
Are you busy?

82
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,720
Not at all.

83
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,940
What's up?

84
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
Can we have a video call?

85
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,010
Grandpa wants to greet you.

86
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,370
Okay, okay.

87
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,240
Is it tiring to work

88
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
over the holiday?

89
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,309
It's alright.

90
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,919
There aren't many people during the Qingming holiday.

91
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,720
How about you?

92
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,870
I'm fine.

93
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,409
I just drove over to chat with my mom.

94
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,820
Wait a moment.

95
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,930
Hello, Miss Shen.

96
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,630
I'm not disturbing your work, am I?

97
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,360
No, not at all.

98
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,160
Not even a bit.

99
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,170
It's been a long time, Professor Yu.

100
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,670
Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,800
They're beautiful.

102
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,220
I thank you on behalf of Suye's mother.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,520
You've tied your hair up.

104
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,410
It makes you look very energetic.

105
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,120
Your complexion has improved a lot too.

106
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,330
Suye's treatment for you seems quite effective.

107
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,390
Of course, that goes without saying.

108
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,110
It's been effective.

109
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,480
You look very energetic too.

110
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,530
It's because I'm happy.

111
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,780
Miss Shen,

112
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,450
will you be working overtime tomorrow?

113
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,130
I won't be working overtime tomorrow.

114
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,930
That's great!

115
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,650
Tomorrow, I will go for a walk

116
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,610
in the herbal garden with Suye.

117
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,780
Do you and your family want to come along?

118
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,310
If it's not abrupt, that is.

119
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,480
You know, as an old man living alone,

120
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,220
holidays can be quite boring.

121
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,620
If you and your family don't mind,

122
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,090
consider it a countryside excursion.

123
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't feel any pressure.

124
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,350
No, no.

125
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,510
There's no pressure at all.

126
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,100
Is it the herbal garden from the medicated diet project last time?

127
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,430
Yes, yes, that's right.

128
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,410
I really like that place.

129
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,300
No problem.

130
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,720
I'll ask my parents about it later.

131
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,510
Alright, alright, then I'll wait for your response.

132
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,270
Good.

133
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,910
Alright, alright.

134
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,930
Go ask Mr. and Mrs. Shen about it.

135
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,840
Tonight,

136
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,920
I'll be staying over at my grandpa's.

137
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,920
Miss Shen, see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,150
Bye-bye,

139
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,290
Dr. He.

140
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,610
Bye-bye.

141
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,380
Spring has arrived.

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,670
Talking about yourself?

143
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,300
Let's get going.

144
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's go.

145
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,570
Can you two help me decide?

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,930
Which of these two should I wear tomorrow?

147
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,940
I... I want to wear a dress.

148
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,620
I don't want to wear sportswear.

149
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,890
Wear sportswear is better.

150
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,990
It's not convenient for you to wear a dress while climbing up and down.

151
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,010
Ms. Shen has already said

152
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,120
that place is particularly difficult to access.

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,170
Since we're finally going, I have to take some photos, right?

154
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,720
This one will definitely look better in photos.

155
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
No, look at this colour.

156
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,310
Do you actually think it's pretty?

157
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,160
It won't look good on you because your skin is dark.

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,820
This would only look good on fair-skinned people.

159
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,680
Then, the dress

160
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,650
is okay, I guess.

161
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,310
There aren't be many people during the Qingming holiday.

162
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,170
What about you?

163
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm fine.

164
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,820
I just drove over to chat with my mom.

165
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,810
Is it okay, Ms. Shen?

166
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,540
It's fine.

167
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,960
It's settled then.

168
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,390
Dad, Mom,

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,920
I have something I want to discuss with you two.

170
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,900
Have a seat.

171
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,360
He Suye's mother passed away many years ago.

172
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,900
He went to sweep his mother's grave,

173
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,950
so he won't be in a great mood tomorrow.

174
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,040
Can we just...

175
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,000
You mean...

176
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,890
I get it. You don't want us to bring it up, right?

177
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,380
Yes.

178
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,850
We won't mention it.

179
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,970
We understand. His grandfather is a TCM practitioner, right?

180
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,390
Yes.

181
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,000
We'll just ask about health preservation and wellness.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Things like this.

183
00:11:59,070 --> 00:11:59,630
Sure.

184
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,240
Don't worry, your mother and I know what we're doing.

185
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,080
Tomorrow, let's just have a

186
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,210
relaxing and enjoyable outing, okay?

187
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,640
Thank you both.

188
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's not bring up the matter of the dowry.

189
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,100
And no bride price either.

190
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,910
Come on, let's see what I should wear.

191
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
Do you know what flower this is?

192
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,060
What flower is this? A small purple flower.

193
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,310
It's so clean.

194
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,590
Take a sniff.

195
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,640
I won't smell it, you smell it.

196
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
You smell it.

197
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,700
It doesn't have any scent.

198
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,780
Let me take a photo of you.

199
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,570
It looks pretty nice like this.

200
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:49,950
Okay.

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,420
It's really clean.

202
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,670
Come help me take a full-body photo.

203
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,970
Here, here, hurry up!

204
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,540
Alright!

205
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,020
Okay.

206
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,930
Let me see.

207
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,360
This tree doesn't look good.

208
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,620
Why are my feet not in it?

209
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,280
Full-body, I said full-body!

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Let me take a look.

211
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,150
This way, this way, this way.

212
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,480
What is that?

213
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,190
He Suye.

214
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,320
Include my legs.

215
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,420
No.

216
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
It's not working.

217
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,420
Okay.

218
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,460
This one is passable.

219
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,970
Ms. Liu, this was taken nicely, wasn't it?

220
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,970
Yes, that's fine.

221
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,260
What did you call her?

222
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,810
I called her Ms. Liu.

223
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,040
It's our family's official title.

224
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,110
Then what do you call him?

225
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,200
Mr. Shen.

226
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,790
I'm an English teacher

227
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,120
in a high school.

228
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,910
What about Shen?

229
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,000
Ms. Shen.

230
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,700
Look.

231
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,230
Your family is so interesting.

232
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,460
We're just joking around.

233
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,960
Yes, yes, yes.

234
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,870
Look, my grandfather

235
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,120
just learned that your family

236
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,720
addresses each other like this.

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,520
He's curious.

238
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,680
Then how will you address me?

239
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,820
Professor Yu.

240
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,290
Let's go with Professor Yu.

241
00:13:59,290 --> 00:13:59,910
Right, right, right.

242
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
We'll call you Professor Yu.

243
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,960
Professor Yu.

244
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,510
You see.

245
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,200
This way, we're like one big family.

246
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,890
How much we resemble a family!

248
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,390
Come on.

249
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,180
Three, two, one.

250
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,370
Good.

251
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,750
You two come and take a photo too.

252
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,340
I'll pass.

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,070
Professor Yu, come take a photo.

254
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,110
It's not often we come to such a beautiful place.

255
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,510
You and He Suye together.

256
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,000
Hurry.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,460
Come on.

258
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,410
Come, come, come.

259
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,210
Okay.

260
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,530
You take the photo.

261
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll take it.

262
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:33,900
Alright.

263
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,860
Three, two, one.

264
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,760
You guys are too serious.

265
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,090
Liven up a bit.

266
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,330
Let's take one more with another pose.

267
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,490
No more photos.

268
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm old now.

269
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,440
I don't like taking photos anymore.

270
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,840
One photo is enough.

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,670
Shen,

272
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,670
why don't you take a photo with Suye?

273
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll take it for you two.

274
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,200
Okay? Come on.

275
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,870
Alright.

276
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,030
You're taking it?

277
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,740
I'll take it.

278
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,930
Tell me how to use this phone.

279
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,080
Yes.

280
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,790
Is it like this?

281
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,240
Yes, yes, yes.

282
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
That's right, like that. Now it's clear.

283
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,070
Okay, okay.

284
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,030
Look here.

285
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,220
Relax.

286
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,320
Okay.

287
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,090
Okay.

288
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,880
Alright.

289
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,260
One.

290
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:42,720
Two.

291
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,140
Three.

292
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,850
This grove is beautiful.

293
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
The air is fresh too.

294
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,410
The ones ahead are cinnamon.

295
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,370
Look at this. Do you remember what it is?

296
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
It's agarwood!

297
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,930
A familiar scent.

298
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,420
Your memory is quite good.

299
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,250
Let's go.

300
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,690
Last time we came,

301
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,120
there weren't any tulips here, were there?

302
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
Well, the tulip blooming season just arrived, didn't it?

303
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,230
Can these tulips be used in medicine?

304
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,590
Yes, they can remove dampness and deodorize.

305
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,080
These aren't for medicinal use.

306
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,010
The medicinal tulips are in the greenhouse up ahead.

307
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,210
But these planted here look quite pretty too.

308
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,440
The yellow ones are beautiful.

309
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,870
I planted these tulips

310
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,540
to commemorate my daughter,

311
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,150
who is also Suye's mother.

312
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,390
Her name is Yu Nianxiang

313
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,880
and her favorite flower was the tulip.

314
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,420
So I asked someone

315
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,980
to plant these tulips.

316
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,450
Every year at this time,

317
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,099
the tulips bloom,

318
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,270
and that's when she knows

319
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,510
we've come to see her.

320
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,270
Let's go.

321
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,329
Let's go see the Paeonia lactiflora garden up ahead.

322
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,260
So,

323
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,950
Auntie's favorite flower was the tulip.

324
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,670
Yes.

325
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,800
She must have loved

326
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,180
the bouquet you prepared yesterday.

327
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,230
Then I can rest easy.

328
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,580
Dr. He,

329
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,000
♫You're like a gentle wind♫

330
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,950
I don't have much to give you.

331
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,050
I'd like to give you these flowers,

332
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,310
double the happiness.

333
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:12,000
♫After early summer afternoon, it blows past my heart♫

334
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,950
Dr. He.

♫When your fingers touch my hands♫

336
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,600
It's really hard to buy tulips of this colour.

337
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,820
I'll give you half of them.

338
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,860
♫So you're also here for me♫

339
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,850
♫I hear you say, red beans grow in the southern lands♫

♫Loving you is the best thing I've ever done♫

♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

344

why I like you?

346
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,000
♫Missing you is the most beautiful thing in my life♫

347
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
Didn't you say it before,

348
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,280
that I hooked you first?

349
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:00,970
Yes,

350
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,360

♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

352

Before you,

353
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,920
treating patients was just a responsibility to me.

354
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,890
But after you came,

355
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,800
I realized that treating patients could be interesting too.

356
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,730
♫I never wish to wake from my dream♫

On your first visit,

362
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,570
you folded your registration form into a paper frog.

363
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,170
I remember thinking,

364
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,790
♫I hear you say, red beans grow in the southern lands♫

365
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,560

♫When spring comes, a few branches begin to sprout♫

367

♫Cherish the youth♫

370
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,890

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,040
But precisely because of this,

374
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,430
I started looking forward to seeing you every week.

375
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,000
♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

376
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,690
He Suye.

377
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,060
♫Missing you is the most beautiful poem in my life♫

378
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,950
Me too.

379
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,250
♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

381
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,810
Mrs. Shen.

382
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,510
Here.

383
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,710
You've gone to so much trouble. Thank you.

384
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,340
These are all food served in our staff canteen.

385
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,510
Medicinal food.

386
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,440
Although it might not look as appetising as food sold in restaurants,

387
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,870
the taste is quite good.

388
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,530
They're all medicinal ingredients in season.

389
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,510
I hope you don't mind.

390
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,440
It's wonderful.

391
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,090
Yes.

392
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,790
Mr. Shen.

393
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,310
Let me help you.

394
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:30,710
No need, no need.

395
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,590
I can manage it myself.

396
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,790
Shen, please sit down, sit.

397
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,600
Let Suye handle these chores.

398
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,550
Good, good.

399
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,230
Professor Yu.

400
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,040
Sit, sit, sit.

401
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,500
I'll go get something.

402
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,480
He, don't be so busy.

403
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,770
It's fine. See if anything else is needed,

404
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,560
I'll go get it for you.

405
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
We have everything. Sit down.

406
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,300
Okay.

407
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,180
That's not quite right.

408
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,720
On such a wonderful day like today,

409
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,500
how can we not have wine?

410
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,470
And this bottle of wine

411
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,670
is different from others.

412
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,740
I've infused it with the best ginseng and goji berries.

413
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,270
It's been steeping since the beginning of winter, almost half a year now.

414
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,880
Now is when both the medicinal and alcoholic properties are at their best.

415
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,440
Well...

416
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,850
Since Professor Yu is here,

417
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,220
you should have a drink with him.

418
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,110
Alright, alright, alright.

419
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,840
She allowed.

420
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,420
Good, good, good.

421
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:31,950
Come on.

422
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,790
Let me help you.

423
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,480
Let me help you.

424
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,240
I'll do it.

425
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,550
It's much better than the wine we have at home.

426
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,010
Well...

427
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,890
It's not in the same league.

428
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,720
Professor Yu, please have some first.

429
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,480
Thank you.

430
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,430
Ms. Liu.

431
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,510
It's fine, give it to me.

432
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,120
Miss Shen, why don't you have some too?

433
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
She can handle it.

434
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,270
I'm not very good at drinking.

435
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,580
I can't hold liquor well.

436
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,590
Besides, if my parents drink too much,

437
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,830
I'll have to take them home.

438
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,360
You guys enjoy yourselves.

439
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,070
Alright, alright.

440
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,980
He, have a drink.

441
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Okay, I'll drink.

442
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
I thought you couldn't drink much.

443
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,530
-I’m fine.
-Come on.

444
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:10,960
Cheers.

445
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,110
Let us express our gratitude.

446
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,160
Cheers, Professor Yu.

447
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,960
Thank you.

448
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
Help yourself.

449
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:16,900
Thank you.

450
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,770
Thank you, He.

451
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,270
We're really grateful for

452
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,730
Professor Yu's invitation today,

453
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,240
allowing us to come to such a wonderful place for an outing,

454
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,590
enjoy such good medicated diet,

455
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,390
and most importantly, I could drink such excellent medicinal wine.

456
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,550
I should fulfil my duties as a host, shouldn't I?

457
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,480
Duties as a host?

458
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,390
Don't you know?

459
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,440
I invested in this herbal garden.

460
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,950
Suye also invested a bit.

461
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,470
He Suye,

462
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,550
you didn't

463
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,060
explain this clearly to Miss Shen?

464
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,480
There's nothing to say about this.

465
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,260
You should introduce, how should I put it,

466
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,550
your personal qualifications to Miss Shen.

467
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,240
I must remind you,

468
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,510
you can't shortchange Miss Shen.

469
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,600
Don't always serve her medicinal food at home.

470
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,270
You should go out

471
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,490
and treat her to some nice meals.

472
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,160
Yes.

473
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,550
We really love medicinal cuisine.

474
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,090
Yes, yes, yes.

475
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,860
He even prescribed some medicinal recipes for us.

476
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,340
I didn't know about this.

477
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,350
Come, Mrs. Shen,

478
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,330
let me toast to you.

479
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,660
Let's do it altogether.

480
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,590
-Come on, altogether.
-Together.

481
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,440
Another toast to you, Professor Yu.

482
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,750
Good, thank you.

483
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,100
Please, don't stand on ceremony.

484
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,400
Professor Yu, today...

485
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm so happy today.

486
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,230
Well then,

487
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,260
when you have time,

488
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,760
welcome to my home.

489
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,920
Come visit my humble abode.

490
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,360
I'd like to prepare some medicinal food for you, if that's alright?

491
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,270
Good, good, good.

492
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,960
Okay.

493
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,440
Where do you live?

494
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,780
We live in the same neighbourhood as He now.

495
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,170
I see.

496
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,550
You live in the same neighbourhood.

497
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,720
What a coincidence!

498
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,470
That's good.

499
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,650
If it's not inconvenient for you,

500
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,340
I'll find time to pay you a visit.

501
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,960
How can this be called a visit?

502
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,880
We're just having a casual meal together.

503
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,750
-Okay?
-Okay.

504
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,650
Just treat it as if you're returning to your own home.

505
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,850
Welcome.

506
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,630
Alright.

507
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,480
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

508
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Certainly.

509
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,220
Thank you, Professor Yu.

510
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,350
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

511
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,390
Your alcohol tolerance is so high.

512
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,160
I'm happy drinking with you all.

513
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,420
Mr. Shen, have some more.

514
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,080
Alright, then Professor Yu, you...

515
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Ms. Liu.

516
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,480
Professor Yu, I really can't keep up.

517
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,410
Ms. Liu, can you handle it?

518
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,720
I'll fill up Mr. Shen's glass.

519
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,620
No, no, no.

520
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,510
Here.

521
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,980
Grandpa, don't drink too much.

522
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,630
I'm fine.

523
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,030
Look at you...

524
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,990
Look at me.

525
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,630
Mrs. Shen,

526
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,510
if Mr. Shen likes it,

527
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,310
I'll give you some to take home.

528
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,960
Please don't let him drink anymore.

529
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,790
It's fine.

530
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,450
He can really hold his liquor.

531
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,050
You've had too much.

532
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,950
You jerk.

533
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,380
It's fine.

534
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,590
I've only had about 250 ml today.

535
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,920
Take some with you if you like drinking it.

536
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,540
Mr. Shen, have some more.

537
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Alright, then Professor Yu, you...

538
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,110
I'll fill up Mr. Shen's cup first.

539
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,280
Professor Yu, okay.

540
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,600
Okay.

541
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,460
Good, good.

542
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,990
These two kids are destined to meet.

543
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,860
They really are.

544
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,980
I remember

545
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,210
one time, a student of mine had an urgent case

546
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,880
and needed to go to the hospital to help out.

547
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,470
So I went on the house call instead.

548
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
The first time...

549
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,410
That is the first time I met Miss Shen.

550
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,620
She was there for a follow-up visit

551
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,830
and left a deep impression on me.

552
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,710
A very beautiful girl

553
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,830
with great aura.

554
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,110
It's hereditary.

555
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,030
Yes, yes, yes.

556
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,160
All the good genes in our family are here.

557
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,400
Yes, yes, yes.

558
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,490
When I came back, I told him.

559
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,550
There was a girl there for a follow-up.

560
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,920
Beautiful and elegant.

561
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,590
I asked "Are you aware?

562
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,620
Do you know her?"

563
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,950
At that time, he looked very depressed,

564
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,620
like it was a pity.

565
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,380
Grandpa.

566
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,640
Enough. Stop talking.

567
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,120
Let me finish what I'm saying.

568
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,230
You were so afraid.

569
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,240
So scared.

570
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,320
Scared of missing this follow-up visit

571
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,790
and that Miss Shen wouldn't come for treatment anymore.

572
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,120
Then, he wouldn't be able to see her again.

573
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,830
After some time, he was very happy one day.

574
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,370
Excited! He said, "Grandpa, Grandpa, do you know?"

575
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,180
"Do you know whose phone number this is?"

576
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,590
I said, "How would I know whose phone number it is?"

577
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,140
"It's the number of

578
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,390
the Miss Shen you mentioned."

579
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,130
He was so excited.

580
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,930
I'm telling you...

581
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,990
Alright, alright, Grandpa.

582
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,620
You've drunk too much. Stop talking.

583
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,680
I'll stop talking.

584
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,250
He's embarrassed.

585
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,370
He's embarrassed.

586
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,260
Come, let's drink.

587
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,670
I... I'll drink with you.

588
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,510
Come on.

589
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,700
Professor Yu, Professor Yu. Come on.

590
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,360
Everyone, please drink less.

591
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,450
Take it easy.

592
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,010
I'm definitely taking it easy.

593
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,670
All of you, please drink less.

594
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,090
He Suye.

595
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,610
Drink more, your alcohol tolerance is good anyway.

596
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,720
If you can drink,

597
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,380
drink more.

598
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,700
I'll deal with you when I get home.

599
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,330
I'm so dizzy.

600
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm drunk, I'm drunk.

601
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,090
You're drunk, huh?

602
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,530
Let me check your pulse.

603
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,510
Your body is quite healthy.

604
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,010
Just a bit...

605
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,760
Heartless.

606
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,310
Good that you know.

607
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,410
Switch hands.

608
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,160
Indeed heartless.

609
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,310
You're checking the wrong place.

610
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,940
Give me back the ring.

611
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,640
No.

612
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,120
I can't give you this.

613
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,570
Professor Yu said today that

614
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,170
he went on the house call on your behalf.

615
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,830
That was only my second visit,

616
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,100
which means after my first visit,

617
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,230
you couldn't stop thinking about me.

618
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,690
And now,

619
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,180
you say I hooked you first.

620
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,750
He Suye, give me the ring.

621
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,510
I’m sorry.

622
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,910
Isn't it enough that I admitted I was wrong?

623
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,450
What were you wrong about?

624
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,870
It was clearly me who pursued you first.

625
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,700
But I still slandered you, saying you hooked me.

626
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,880
And then?

627
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,320
Although I did it to pursue you,

628
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:20,220
I was indeed a bit shameless.

629
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
A bit, huh?

630
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,650
And then?

631
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,790
There's more?

632
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,450
I'm a scumbag.

633
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,710
Good that you know.

634
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,500
Don't be angry anymore.

635
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Let go.

636
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,320
I won't.

637
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,640
I'll bite you.

638
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Go ahead and bite.

639
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,030
What are you doing?

640
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,310
What do those ellipsis mean?

641
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,070
Your intention?

642
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,380
I miss you.

643
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,490
Afraid you'll slip away.

644
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,750
Want to hook you again.

645
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,730
Textual evidence. I've taken a screenshot.

646
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,860
Alright, you can make a video call now.

647
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,270
He, come here quickly.

648
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,670
There's a consultation.

649
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,790
Coming, coming.

650
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,570
I believe everyone has already heard.

651
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,920
Thanks to the efforts of our Marketing Department,

652
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,240
in mid-May,

653
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,420
the 8th Summer Conference of the Chinese Medical Association Conference

654
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,830
will be held at our hotel.

655
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,740
It's quite a big event.

656
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,880
Attendees will include top experts from the medical field,

657
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,270
both domestic and international.

658
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,320
All of you here

659
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,720
already have rich experience

660
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
in organizing large-scale events.

661
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,000
So I believe we can handle this with ease.

662
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,430
Well...

663
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,950
There's nothing.

664
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,480
It's really thanks to Mr. Lin's efforts

665
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,890
that we get to organise another big event.

666
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,160
Just trying to earn some extra bonus, right?

667
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
Later on, let's all take some annual leave together

668
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,930
and go on a trip.

669
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,310
You two can even get double bonus.

670
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,350
What double bonus?

671
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,200
His is his,

672
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,130
and mine is mine.

673
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,650
I hate these big events, they're exhausting.

674
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,140
Enough, enough, enough.

675
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,790
Calm down. Calm down.

676
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,770
Come on,

677
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,160
is my comrade

678
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,360
coming to the medical summit this time?

679
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,480
I don't know.

680
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:01,960
What's wrong?

681
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,640
Is there something going on?

682
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,360
Tell us.

683
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,670
It's nothing.

684
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,720
It's just that the two of us

685
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,480
were reviewing things at home the other day,

686
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,800
and I realized he was the one who pursued me first.

687
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,239
But before that, he tricked me

688
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,300
and made me take responsibility for him.

689
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,679
My comrade's level of ideological consciousness

690
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,540
really needs improvement.

691
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,900
What should you do in this situation?

692
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,199
You should just aim his face

693
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,219
and slap, slap, slap!

694
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,090
Just hit him!

695
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,510
I'll slap you in the face.

696
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,719
Slap, slap, slap!

697
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,409
That's it.

698
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,280
Just kidding, just kidding.

699
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,010
I'm joking.

700
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,659
But seriously though,

701
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,710
you should really let my comrade come.

702
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,800
It's right in his professional field.

703
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,840
At the same time, he gets to see

704
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,889
your grace while hosting large events.

705
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,080
Who has any grace while hosting big events?

706
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,650
How about we have a few drinks together this weekend?

707
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,120
Invite your Dr. He too.

708
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,560
I can handle my drinks pretty well.

709
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,260
But if he drinks, then...

710
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,850
His behavior when drinking is also concerning, huh?

711
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,210
What do you mean "also"?

712
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,240
My drinking behavior is quite good.

713
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,910
Alright, alright.

714
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,840
We'll invite him then.

715
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,920
Let him come as the designated driver.

716
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,960
-Okay.
-Okay.

717
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,430
How's business?

718
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,080
It's alright. Um...

719
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,600
Dr. He, are you waiting here for your girlfriend to get off work?

720
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,330
Yes, I am.

721
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,800
This is nice.

722
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,160
The bus is coming.

723
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,250
Is it this one?

724
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,060
Oh, yes it is.

725
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,550
Let's chat later.

726
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,280
Okay.

727
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,510
We haven't seen each other all day.

728
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,880
Can't I even have a hug?

729
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,730
I don't want to. I'm afraid you'll trick me again.

730
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,930
Is the trust between us so fragile now?

731
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,290
Then explain to me.

732
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,890
Why did you hang up on my video call today?

733
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,480
I can actually explain this.

734
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,580
Hurry up, hurry up, the consultation is starting.

735
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,230
Oh, I've lost my pen.

736
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,760
Lend me one.

737
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,170
No.

738
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,490
Why are you being so stingy?

739
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, right.

740
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,800
Wait, after the consultation, can you help me with something?

741
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,720
Help with what?

742
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,450
Just help me, that's all.

743
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,960
You won't even lend me a pen.

744
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,960
Today at 8:45 in the morning,

745
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,620
I suddenly needed He for a consultation.

746
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,300
The consultation lasted for about twenty minutes.

747
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,560
Is this alright?

748
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,170
You're still watching?

749
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,200
Didn't I already tell you?

750
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,690
I really didn't hang up on you on purpose.

751
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,820
I really had something urgent come up.

752
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,660
Not necessarily.

753
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,130
He's your colleague.

754
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,820
What if he's covering for you?

755
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,410
Then I'll have to show you the surveillance footage

756
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,730
to prove my innocence.

757
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,160
No, no, no.

758
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
I can't trouble others anymore.

759
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,440
I'd feel embarrassed.

760
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,440
I'm not even embarrassed.

761
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,060
Miss Shen,

762
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,640
has your trust in me been restored,

763
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,290
even just a little bit?

764
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,590
Well,

765
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,510
just a tiny bit.

766
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,910
I'm hungry.

767
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,560
Be patient, it'll be ready soon.

768
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,340
Thank you.

769
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,690
Oh, by the way, He Suye,

770
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,590
our hotel is going to host an event for

771
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,340
the Chinese Medical Association.

772
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,670
Did you know about this?

773
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,560
I know about this event. What about it?

774
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,530
Will you be coming?

775
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,120
Grandpa might go,

776
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,670
but I'm not sure about myself.

777
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,330
I'm not qualified enough yet.

778
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,000
Alright.

779
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,340
On Friday,

780
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:11,750
Xiangya,

781
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,370
Senior Lin, and I

782
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,730
are planning to have a small gathering and drink a bit.

783
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,930
Do you want to join us?

784
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,960
Sure, it's a good chance to relax too.

785
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,020
I'll be drinking then,

786
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,070
so you should be mindful.

787
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,570
I know.

788
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,440
I'll just drink cola, is that okay?

789
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
How's the soup today?

790
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,880
It's delicious.

791
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,480
The seasoning is just right.

792
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,320
He.

793
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,120
Director.

794
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,580
Let me tell you something.

795
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,550
Next month,

796
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,770
the Chinese Medical Association

797
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,450
will hold a summer summit in our city.

798
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,510
There'll be a session

799
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,890
for young doctors to present their reports.

800
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,110
The hospital recommended

801
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,000
your research on breast cancer.

802
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,720
Really?

803
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,330
The association's view is that

804
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,960
improving the quality of life of late-stage cancer patients

805
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,920
is a new hot topic in today's society.

806
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,060
They're very interested

807
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,590
and are willing to give you this opportunity.

808
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,080
Of course, the outcome

809
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,370
still depends on your research content.

810
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:25,980
Yes.

811
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,250
So this week,

812
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,680
make the most of your time

813
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,900
and try to have the report organized and submitted by Monday.

814
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,530
The hospital will submit it to the association

815
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,320
to help you secure this opportunity.

816
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,050
Alright, thank you, Director.

817
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,680
For you new doctors,

818
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,130
this is a great opportunity to stand out.

819
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,590
Others are also eyeing this chance eagerly.

820
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,630
So,

821
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,580
work hard these couple of days

822
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,260
and organize the report well.

823
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,830
Seize this opportunity.

824
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:54,830
Certainly.

825
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,320
Keep up the good work.

826
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,520
Thank you, Director.

827
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,480
You can go now.

828
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,340
Not off work yet?

829
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,810
I just have a report to write last minute.

830
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,940
You all can head back first.

831
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,800
Then we'll go eat something nice.

832
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,590
Goodbye, Senior He.

833
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,280
Goodbye, Senior He.

834
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,920
What should we eat?

835
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,160
I want to eat grilled fish.

836
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,330
Let's have hot pot.

837
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,800
Grilled fish again?

838
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,250
The hotpot is not that good though.

839
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,280
Then let's head over first.

840
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,520
Alright, we'll go eat first.

841
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,280
You're treating, right?

842
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,880
Okay, I'll treat you.

843
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,870
Bye-bye.

844
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,420
Senior.

845
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,280
Kexin.

846
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
It's raining so heavily today.

847
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,670
Yeah, the weather isn't very good.

848
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,630
Right, let's have a meal later.

849
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,800
Sure, what do you want to eat?

850
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,630
Clay pot chicken.

851
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,480
Let's go.

852
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,670
Let's go.

853
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,060
I probably won't be able to make it tonight.

854
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,190
I have to work overtime unexpectedly.

855
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,990
Okay.

856
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,490
I'll come pick you up later.

857
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,330
No need. You focus on your work.

858
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,290
What’s wrong? You're making a face.

859
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,720
He Suye can't make it anymore.

860
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,850
He has to work overtime.

861
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,330
My comrade can't make it?

862
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,100
It's better that he doesn't come.

863
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,500
Let's go have fun together. Come on.
