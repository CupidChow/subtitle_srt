[Episode 6: Artemisia argyi]
[Bitter, pungent, and warm;
it warms the meridians, stops bleeding, and relieves pain.]

3
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,560
Miss Shen, wh-what's wrong?

4
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,840
Miss Shen, are you alright?

5
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,440
Are you...

6
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,840
Are you...

7
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,590
Are you okay?

8
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,449
Are you...

9
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,800
Are you feeling unwell?

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,260
What happened?

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,240
Dr. He.

12
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,579
My stomach hurts.

13
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,660
Stomach pain?

14
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,310
Is it menstrual cramps?

15
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,540
Did you take painkillers?

16
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,740
I did.

17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,320
It seems like the painkillers didn't work.

18
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,740
Come on.

19
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,340
I'll take you for a check-up.

20
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,360
Be careful.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,210
I've got you.

22
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,600
Take it slow.

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,160
Let's go.

24
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,530
Lie down, I'll do some moxibustion on you.

25
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,190
Is it okay if I sit?

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
What's wrong?

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,450
I'm worried I might leak my period blood...

28
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,480
on the sheet.

29
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,010
Oh, I thought it was something else.

30
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,870
Don't worry, I've got disposable sheets on the bed.

31
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,460
It's just your pants...

32
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,470
I'll get you a jacket to cover up later.

33
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,000
If you don't do moxibustion,

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
are you just gonna suffer the cramps all night?

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Lie down.

36
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,610
Let me check you out.

37
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,150
What happened today?

38
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,230
You caught a chill.

39
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,630
Your belly is so cold.

40
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll do moxibustion for you.

41
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,560
♫A light scent♫

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,270
♫Slowly awakening my heart♫

43
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,930
♫The elusive little mist appears and disappears♫

44
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,430
♫Quietly entering your world, your memories♫

45
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,680
♫The unexpected encounter with the wind♫

46
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,220
♫Layer by layer, rendering the air♫

47
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,630
Do you feel the warmth?

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,030
If the temperature isn't right,

49
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,400
♫The whispers that are sometimes far, sometimes near♫

50
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,430
you need to tell me, okay?

51
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,160
Okay.

52
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,400
♫Exchanging our hidden secrets♫

53
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,240
♫Using my breath♫

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,340
♫To blend the soothing scent of love♫

55
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,060
♫To merge in♫

56
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,750
I didn't know you had period cramps.

57
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,590
When I checked your pulse,

58
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,690
I didn't notice any cramp problems either.

59
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,620
What's going on?

60
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,050
Don't be shy about your period and not talk about it.

61
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
Having a regular cycle

62
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,530
is really important for women's health.

63
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,080
I told you

64
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,510
not to drink cold stuff,

65
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,770
but you didn't listen.

66
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,040
Actually...

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,680
Actually, I didn't get cramps before.

68
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,350
Did you get caught in the rain today?

69
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,750
What's wrong?

70
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
It's just that...

71
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,790
when I'm on my period,

72
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,590
my emotions are all over the place.

73
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,270
Sorry, I need to cry for a minute.

74
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,690
How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

75
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,750
Much better.

76
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,490
My belly doesn't hurt as much.

77
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,540
Good to know.

78
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,260
This is my shirt.

79
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,550
You can put it on first.

80
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,780
It can cover you up

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,060
and also keep you warm.

82
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,280
It's probably a bit chilly outside now.

83
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,150
Okay.

84
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,140
Well, after I'm done,

85
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,870
I'll wash it and give it back.

86
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,510
Okay.

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
The moxibustion

88
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,230
needs a bit more time to fully take effect.

89
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,270
If you're free after work these next couple days,

90
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,200
you can come back for a few more sessions.

91
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,630
Okay.

92
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,870
Don't rush to shower when you get home.

93
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,130
The mugwort smell will linger for a while,

94
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,530
just bear with it for now.

95
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,340
Got it.

96
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,620
You should go home first.

97
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,820
Your parents must be worried about you.

98
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,910
Dr. He,

99
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,490
how about I wait for you

100
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,950
and we can leave together?

101
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,080
I need to tidy up for a while.

102
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,960
You go ahead.

103
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,060
Okay.

104
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,750
Thank you then.

105
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,160
You're welcome.

106
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,300
You're feeling so down.

107
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Are you still reluctant to breakup?

108
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Here, Ms. Shen, have some of this.

109
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,320
I don't want to drink it. I can't drink anymore.

110
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,550
I made this especially for you.

111
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,440
You're so weak today.

112
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Have some brown sugar water.

113
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,910
It's good for your blood.

114
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,960
Do you know that?

115
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,630
Come on, take a sip.

116
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,360
Just one sip.

117
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,620
This...

118
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,750
This isn't mine.

119
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,010
She brought it back.

120
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,050
What should we do then?

121
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
No, no, no.

122
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,330
Just play along with me.

123
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Well...

124
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,480
This shirt is...

125
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,630
Oversize!

126
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,240
Your English is so good.

127
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,670
Someone gave this to me.

128
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,480
Didn't I get my pants dirty?

129
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,860
So he just gave it to me to cover up.

130
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,870
That TCM doctor?

131
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,680
Ms. Shen.

132
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,510
Last time, you insisted

133
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,630
that you weren't familiar with that doctor.

134
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,480
We really aren't familiar with each other.

135
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,840
He was just being nice,

136
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,960
I got my period on my pants,

137
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,260
and he covered me up so I wouldn't be embarrassed.

138
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,520
What does he look like?

139
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,550
Just an average-looking guy.

140
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,440
You even called Lin an average-looking guy.

141
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,720
But I think he's quite handsome.

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,360
Is he handsome?

143
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,960
Handsome.

144
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,840
Where's the photo?

145
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,900
Where's the photo?

146
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,430
I don't have his photo.

147
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,810
I mean it.

148
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,890
Alright, alright.

149
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,330
I'm not feeling well today.

150
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,180
I'm going to bed now.

151
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,090
I'll take a shower when I wake up tomorrow morning.

152
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,490
Are you sure you can fall asleep this early?

153
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,840
Yeah, I'm sure.

154
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,640
I'm so sleepy.

155
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,960
Come on, come on.

156
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm going to sleep.

157
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,960
Fine.

158
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,370
There's something fishy about it.

159
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,120
That shirt looks nice,

160
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,250
buy one for me, okay?

161
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Do you want to wear a matching shirt with him?

162
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,840
Hey, watch it!

163
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,400
His Moments are all about TCM!

164
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,810
His photo skills are just like a stereotypical guy's.

165
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,750
Hold on.

166
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,890
Why am I feeling guilty?

167
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,730
I should like a few more posts instead.

168
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,670
This one.

169
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,410
That's right.

170
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,300
This one.

171
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,330
Still not sleeping?

172
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,290
I'm about to sleep.

173
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,790
Didn't you see

174
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,830
the health article I shared?

175
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,280
It says people need to sleep before 11 PM.

176
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,070
No phones before bed, and stay calm.

177
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,400
Article?

178
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,920
What article?

179
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,270
WeChat moments?

180
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,740
I saw it.

181
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,770
So I'm about to sleep.

182
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,110
Your reading skills are great.

183
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,070
You read seven or eight articles in a minute.

184
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,440
And you absorbed them all.

185
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
Speed-reader, huh?

186
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,720
Those likes...

187
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,350
I'm doomed!

188
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,270
Haha...

189
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,320
Brown sugar ginger bubble tea.

190
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,830
Didn't you drink enough Chinese medicine?

191
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,720
Now you're even drinking healthy bubble tea.

192
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
I'm on my period and my belly hurts.

193
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,480
You never cared before.

194
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,030
Yesterday was day one,

195
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,400
and I wasn't feeling well
so I went to Dr. He for moxibustion.

196
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,130
He urged me to keep that in mind.

197
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,120
This doctor is really responsible, isn't he?

198
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,160
Oh, right, Xiangya.

199
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,240
Unlock your phone,

200
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,640
I want to test a feature with you.

201
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,070
What's up?

202
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,920
See,

203
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,070
if I accidentally

204
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,590
like your post on Moments

205
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,640
and unlike it right away,

206
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
do you still get a notification?

207
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,720
Yeah!

208
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,920
I've gotten a bunch of dudes' attention with this move.

209
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,850
Huh?

210
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
Then I guessed right.

211
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Yesterday I liked Dr. He's post and then unliked it.

212
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
To make it look casual, I liked a few more posts.

213
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,400
But he found out.

214
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,830
I was totally caught red-handed.

215
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,830
I'm so doomed.

216
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,790
What's the big deal?

217
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,400
Just say it to him directly

218
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,440
that you're curious about him

219
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,830
and want to see his Moments.
What's wrong with that?

220
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,590
Let me see your chat history.

221
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,920
I'll give you some advice.

222
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,790
It's that one.

223
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,350
Lin Yishen.

224
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,070
From a guy's perspective,

225
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,240
do you think there's a chance here?

226
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:33,920
Let me see.

227
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,590
At 11:45 PM,

228
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,890
he asked, "Still not sleeping?"

229
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
There's a chance.

230
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,350
How so?

231
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,440
Do you think a guy would care

232
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,000
when a girl he's not interested in

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,200
goes to sleep?

234
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,000
But he's my doctor,

235
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,730
and he's treating my insomnia,

236
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,550
of course he'd care when I go to sleep.

237
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

238
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,240
Just as I expected.

239
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,700
He's a boring old scholar.

240
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,920
Weren't you

241
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,250
drinking that licorice water a while ago?

242
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,750
He barely posts on Moments.

243
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,000
Look, he posted one about licorice.

244
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
He told me about the licorice water,

245
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,340
so of course he had to teach me how to drink it, right?

246
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,480
This hot TCM doctor is such a player.

247
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,270
He posted it on Moments on purpose

248
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,400
waiting for you to like it,

249
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
and he could chat with you.

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But it turns out, he posted it months ago,

251
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,640
and you only liked it just now.

252
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,200
Honestly, I think he should just be more straightforward.

253
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,000
Didn't you say

254
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,460
that he's nice, great,

255
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,030
handsome and gentle?

256
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,090
And he even supports your plan to study abroad!

257
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,920
He can do things that Yan Heng couldn't do.

258
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,160
Why don't you give him a chance?

259
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,270
How can he be the same as Yan Heng?

260
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,620
He's my friend.

261
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,720
You two are also my friends.

262
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,450
You both support me too, right?

263
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,180
Well, we are us.

264
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,750
But that TCM doctor is a guy!

265
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,510
That's different.

266
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,750
Am I not a guy?

267
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,590
We've known each other for a long time.

268
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,790
But Dr. He is different.

269
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,640
No matter how long we've known each other, I'm still a guy.

270
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,510
Shut up.

271
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,270
I won't.

272
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,670
Alright, stop fighting.

273
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,370
Poor hot TCM doctor.

274
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,790
The guy has feelings, but the girl does not.

277
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,190
or it'll make the dryness worse.

You can try them when cooking.

Thank you.

283
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,160
But why did you suddenly send me this?

284
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,070
I saw your Moments.

285
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,060
Try not to eat ginger in autumn,
or it could make the dryness worse.

286
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,310
At 11:45 PM, he asked, "Still not sleeping?"

287
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,480
Do you think a man would care

288
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,030
when a girl he's not interested in

289
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,110
goes to sleep?

290
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,130
He barely posts on Moments.

291
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,630
Look, he posted something about licorice.

292
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,440
This handsome TCM doctor is such a player.

293
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,350
He posted it on Moments on purpose

294
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,240

he posted it months ago,

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,550
and you only liked it just now.

299
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,210
Honestly, I think he should just be more direct.

300
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,550
Okay.

301
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,480
Looks like you've been keeping a close eye on my Moments.

302
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,240
But the ginger in the bubble tea doesn't really count.

303
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,750
Can my family members try these recipes?

304
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,710
My father has hypertension,

306
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,390
Yes, they can.

307
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,940
Medicinal food is mild. Everyone can eat it.

308
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,940
Thank you, Dr. He.

309
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,610
You're welcome.

310
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,540
Why am I overthinking it?

311
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm just making things up in my head.

312
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,940
Mom!

313
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,460
Doc...

314
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:35,920
What's wrong?

315
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,310
Doctor!

316
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,910
Please check what's wrong with my mom quickly!

317
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,670
Mom!

318
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,480
Mom, wake up!

319
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,480
Mom!

320
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,590
Open the IV line.

Prepare one set of respiratory stimulants
and one set of blood pressure medications.

322

Go prepare them quickly.

323
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,680
Okay.

327
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,070
Don't panic.

328
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,030
Come here.

329
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,980
Don't be sad, don't panic.

330
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,960
The patient

331
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,920
has brain metastasis,

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,580
pressing on the vital center.

333
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,310
It's not looking good.

334
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,110
She needs to be transferred to ICU

335
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,240
for invasive treatment immediately.

336
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,370
Invasive?

337
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,120
Yes.

338
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,070
The situation is very urgent.

339
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,930
We must perform a tracheostomy and cardiac pacing.

340
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,030

341
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
No, no.

342
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,740
My mom has been through enough,

343
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,030
please don't make her suffer more.

344
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,310
This is the most effective method.

345
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,160
No, we're not doing this surgery.

346
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,550
But this is the only chance.

347
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,400
It's too painful!

348
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,060
Doctor...

349
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,270
Doctor,

350
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,000
can you think of a way

351
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,830
to buy some time for my mom?

352
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,070
I want my family to see her one last time.

353
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,310
Please.

354
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,030
Can you help me find a way?

355
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,440
Alright.

356
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,140
I'll do my best.

357
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,570
Okay, thank you.

358
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,440
Mom, please hang in there.

359
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,440
Mom!

360
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,310
Mr. He.

361
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,170
Are you sure you want to give up?

362
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,140
The tumor has already spread.

363
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,010
Her respiratory and cardiac functions have been affected.

364
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,880
There's no point in rescuing her.

365
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,130
Let her go.

366
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,830
Dr. He.

367
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,720
Why are you here?

368
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm here to buy some food.

369
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,110
You're eating too?

370
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,590
Why do you look so down?

371
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,110
Not really.

372
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,310
I'm just eating.

373
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,490
Did...

374
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,510
did something happen?

375
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,830
It's nothing.

376
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,530
What's wrong? Why are you keep staring at me?

377
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,880
I can tell that you're upset.

378
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,920
But I don't know how to cheer yo up.

379
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,790
If you're not busy,

380
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,190
would you take a walk with me?

381
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,720
Sure.

382
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,090
Are you okay?

383
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,280
I'm fine.

384
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,940
Be careful.

385
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:06,370
♫We found each other♫

386
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,870
♫But we've been miles apart♫

387
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:22,830
♫We found each other♫

388
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:31,450
♫But we've been miles apart♫

389
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:43,000
♫And I don't think it's fair♫
