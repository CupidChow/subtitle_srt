[The Best Thing]

[Episode 14: Citrus Peel]
[Bitter, spicy, and warm in nature.
It regulates qi, strengthens the spleen, reduces dampness, and eliminates phlegm.]

3
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,790
Later, his girlfriend got

4
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,590
an opportunity to study abroad,

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,510
so she broke up with Senior He.

6
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,070
And after leaving the country, she never came back.

7
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,190
You were already so insecure in a long-distance relationship,

8
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,990
let alone an international one.

9
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,410
Wake up.

10
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,710
Senior He has always been a very gentle

11
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,940
and kind person,

12
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,360
but that doesn't mean you can

13
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,490
treat him casually.

14
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,490
Remember to take your medicine on time.

15
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,270
Shen Xifan.

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not easy to find someone

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
who genuinely cares for you.

18
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,079
Can you stop

19
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,590
pushing him away, okay?

20
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,740
♫It's fate, it must be fate♫

22
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,940
♫It's fake, it must be fake♫

23
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,040
♫Far, away, we part, our ways♫

25
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,540

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,540

♫When you're away♫

28
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,830
You caught a cold? I'll turn up the air conditioner temperature for you a bit.

29
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,290
Let me know if you're cold.

30
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,130
Thank you.

31
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,310
He, you're here!

32
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,240
He, you're back?

33
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,800
He came back.

34
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Don't rush!

35
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,750
This is for you.

36
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,040
You didn't need to bring so many gifts!

37
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,190
I just picked up some health products,

38
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,920
and the toys are for the children.

39
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Kids, come on, come on!

40
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,870
Come home!

41
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,070
Come and get the toys. Let's distribute them together.

42
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,330
Your dad is over there.

43
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,470
He, you're back, huh?

44
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,159
Carry on.

45
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay, okay.

46
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,159
Continue.

47
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,630
You guys keep talking.

48
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,410
Why did you arrive so late?

49
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,290
I just finished work

50
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
and then caught the latest flight here.

51
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,340
Have you eaten?

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,710
Not yet.

53
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,360
It's okay.

54
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,580
I'll ask your aunt to make some late-night snacks for you later.

55
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,320
No need. I can just find something to eat myself.

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,460
You don't need to find food elsewhere yourself.

57
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,990
We have everything at home.

58
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,630
You've caught a cold?

59
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,240
It's nothing.

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,190
Just a minor cold.

61
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,480
The toys Uncle gave us are awesome!

62
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,930
Then, I'll go upstairs to rest first.

63
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,620
Wait a moment.

64
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,020
Come here, come here, come here.

65
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,170
Perfect timing.

66
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,070
Let me...

67
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,830
introduce you.

68
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,290
This is Nurse Wang from our hospital.

69
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,490
She's staying with us for the New Year this year.

70
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,810
This is my son, He Suye, whom I've often mentioned to you.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,930
Nice to meet you.

72
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,380
Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,580
Let me introduce you.

74
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,630
This is my son,

75
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,310
Wang Chang.

76
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,520
Chang, say hello.

77
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
Hello, Uncle.

78
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,770
No, that's not right.

79
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,830
You should call him "Brother."

80
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,630
It's alright.

81
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,790
You can just call me "Dr. He."

82
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Hello, Dr. He.

83
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,870
Then... I'll go upstairs to rest first.

84
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,600
Okay.

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Oh, right.

86
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,000
They're staying

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,360
in your old room this year.

88
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,420
Why don't you stay on the first floor?

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,390
Okay.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,190
Okay.

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Then...

92
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,560
That's just how he is.

93
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,870
Why don't you find his aunt

94
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,240
and ask her to fix him some late-night snacks,

95
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,190
and you can help?

96
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,400
Let's go, son.

98
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,990
Mom.

99
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,760
I want toys too.

100
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,070
Son,

101
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,830
when we get back to Bei City, Mom will buy you some, okay?

102
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,510
Alright.

103
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,310
Good boy.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,290
Let's go.

105
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:30,730
[Jiangzhou Bank wishes you a happy birthday.]

106
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,600
[Jiangzhou Unicom: Dear Unicom user, happy birthday.]

107
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:11,670
New Year's bonus for everyone!

108
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,360
Really?

109
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,240
Of course, it's real.

110
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,480
Come on, come on!

111
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,270
Wait a moment!

112
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,720
Come on, come on!

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,440
Wait, wait, wait!

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,750
Let me say a few words first.

115
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,600
Thank you all for your hard work over the past year!

116
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
Applause!

117
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,630
Applause!

118
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,370
With everyone's support,

119
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,990
we've been able to manage such a large

120
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,190
Gunan Huating Hotel!

121
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,790
In the new year, I'll still be counting on all of you!

122
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay!

123
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,030
Okay.

124
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,790
Here are the red packages, one for each person.

125
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,650
Happy New Year!

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,550
Okay, thank you, Manager Cheng!

127
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,600
May you look radiant this year!

128
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Thank you.

129
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Wishing you a sweet life!

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,630
Thank you!

131

May all your wishes come true!

132
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,030
Happy New Year!

133
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,390
May you eat and sleep well!

134
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,630
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

135
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,750
General Manager, may you become more and more handsome in the new year

136
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,270
and grow to 1.88 meters tall soon!

137
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,910
I also hope you become even more handsome than me.

138
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,110
Keep up the good work.

139
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,450
Look at what you made!

140
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,270
Public resources.

141
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,120
What kind of dumpling is this?

142
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,270
All the filling has fallen out.

143
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,120
You should be fined for this.

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,180
How embarrassing!

145
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,330
Take it, take it!

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,790
Happy New Year!

147
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,440
Hurry up, hurry up!

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,910
Okay.

149
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,720
Come on, come on!

150
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,270
Everyone, let's count down together: three, two, one.

151
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,320
Three, two, one.

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,790
Happy New Year!

153
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,530
Happy New Year, Xifan.

154
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,910
See you next year.

155
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,870
See you next year. Go home and get some good rest.

156
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,120
You should go home and rest early today as well.

157
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Alright, I'll dutifully finish my last shift.

158
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,870
Xiangya?

159
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,360
Text me when you land, okay?

160
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,490
Just to let me know you arrived safely.

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,670
I'm back, bye-bye.

162
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,200
Bye-bye.

163
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,670
Let's go. I'll take you to the airport.

164
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,400
No need. I can grab a cab myself.

165
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,500
It's New Year's. There aren't many drivers available.

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,080
Let's go.

167
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,670
Happy New Year, Grandma.

168
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,170
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

169
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,760
You look even more beautiful in the new year.

170
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,460
Thank you.

171
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,210
Hurry up and drink.

172
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,480
What are you guys doing over there?

173
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,390
Come on, drink up, drink up.

174
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,390
Everyone to the table, to the table.

175
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,720
The dish is here!

176
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,650
The dish is here!

177
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,560
There are more dishes coming.

178
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,910
Okay.

179
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,600
Let's eat together.

180
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,160
I'll join you later. There's more to come.

181
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,030
You go ahead and attend to them first.

182
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,030
Alright, you go ahead then.

183
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,660
Okay.

184
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,790
It's alright, it's alright.

185
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,160
Breaking things brings peace. Breaking things brings peace.

186
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,110
A New Year's Eve dinner wouldn't be complete without soup.

187
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,290
Sheng, look what your wife did!

188
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,870
It's the New Year, after all.

189
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,670
Make another pot.

190
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,550
Forget it. Forget it.

191
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,510
It's nothing.

192
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,510
It's not a big deal.

193
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,150
It's fine.

194
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,690
Let me tell you...

195
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,170
Sheng,

196
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,200
it's really impressive

197
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
that our town has produced

198
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,300
such an outstanding doctor like you!

199
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,470
Well,

200
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,840
we'll be counting on you for our medical care from now on.

201
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Sheng!

202
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,970
Why talk about illness on New Year?

203
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,110
We should say we'll all be

204
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
relying on Sheng for our long lives.

205
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,550
Right, right, right.

206
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,320
That's right, Sheng, we're all counting on you.

207
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,030
Okay, okay.

208
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,600
Sheng...

209
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,810
Mom, hurry up.

210
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
Dinner is ready!

211
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,390
It's New Year's!

212
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,590
Drinking this again?

213
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,600
It's New Year's today.

214
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,240
I can drink this, right?

215
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,260
Yes, yes.

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,910
Ms. Shen can drink a little today.

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,930
It's okay. It's okay.

218
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,690
Come on.

219
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
This one for Ms. Shen.

220
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,850
Let me say something.

221
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,220
Time flies by quickly.

222
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
The years wait for no one.

223
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,460
On this...

224
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,800
day of family reunion,

225
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,790
first, I wish our Ms. Liu,

226
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,320
in the new year,

227
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,390
safety and health,

228
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,840
beauty like a flower,

229
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
and a return to eighteen.

230
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,440
So sweet.

231
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
And I also wish our Ms. Shen

232
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,150
everything goes smoothly

233
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,270
and wealth rolls in.

234
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,270
Get rich quickly.

235
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,210
May your wish to get rich quickly come true soon!

236
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,670
Finally, I wish for our family of three

237
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,130
to be happy and fulfilled.

238
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,480
Even though

239
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,760
you'll be studying abroad soon,

240
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,590
our family of three will always

241
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,140
remain connected in heart.

242
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,080
Let's make a wish for your father too.

243
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,390
May your father's cooking get better and better,

244
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,000
and feed our Ms. Shen well,

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,510
okay?

246
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:25,870
Okay.

247
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,320
Okay!

248
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,720
Okay.

249
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:26,960
Come on.

250
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,510
Come on.

251
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,670
Cheers!

252
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,000
-Cheers!
-Happy New Year!

253
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,150
Happy New Year, Third Uncle.

254
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,150
I'm here to wish you a Happy New Year.

255
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,830
[Yan Heng]

256
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,520
Happy New Year.

257
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,750
Wishing you happiness every day,

258
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,360
Xifan.

259
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,300
[Add to blacklist]

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,600
Oh, I'm especially happy

261
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,480
for the New Year this year.

262
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,870
Our He family has two great doctors!

263
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,360
That's right.

264
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
One is Sheng,

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
and the other is his son, Suye, right?

266
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Yes, yes, yes.

267
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,550
They both came back for New Year's this year, right?

268
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,320
It's so rare.

269
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
Especially Sheng.

270
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,340
He even brought Wang back!

271
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,870
Our whole family is reunited! Come on, come on!

272
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,440
Cheers, cheers!

273
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,320
May everyone have an even better year ahead.

274
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,510
Better and better.

275
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,720
Sheng,

276
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,910
-you must drink more today.
-Eat up.

277
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,550
Ah, okay.

278
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,810
Your new look is really handsome.

279
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,110
In the new year, may you be like Sun Wukong,

280
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,240
healthy and lively.

281
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,240
Mom said to let you pay New Year's respects

282
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,080
to the auntie who sent the toys on my behalf

283
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,810
to thank her for her encouragement.

284
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,530
Okay.

285
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,000
Hey, pour the wine, pour the wine.

286
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,960
Zhao Ze, the boy you gave the Transformer to before,

287
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,690
asked me to wish you a Happy New Year on his behalf.

288
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,510
Okay.

289
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,160
Cheers, cheers.

290
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,440
Please.

291
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,280
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

292
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,110
We don't have room for it.

293
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,660
We've just finished dinner.

294
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,830
Oh, alright, alright.

295
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,790
Just have a small bite.

296
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,880
I'll eat it later.

297
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,270
Look at the clothes that the actor was wearing just now.

298
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,590
This is it.

299
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,310
You've drunk so much.

300
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,440
Have another drink.

301
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Here, have some water first.

302
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,840
Hurry.

303
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,000
After drinking some water...

304
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,550
I'm fine.

305
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,880
I'll help you into the room.

306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,430
He?

307
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,750
He?

308
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,110
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

309
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,240
You should take the child and go upstairs now.

310
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,300
Don't catch a cold.

311
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,200
Okay.

312
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,830
Then, tell him to drink more water.

313
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,720
Alright, alright.

314
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,450
Don't worry.

315
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,650
Chang,

316
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,570
let's not eat anymore.

317
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
Mom will take you upstairs to bed, okay?

318
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:11,920
Dad?

319
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,160
Dad.

320
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,640
Dad?

321
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,680
Come on, have some water, have some water.

322
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,750
Don't choke, come on.

323
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,720
It'll help clear your head a bit.

324
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,810
I drank too much.

325
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,350
I've been saying that...

326
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,160
All gone?

327
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Drink some water.

328
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,290
Everyone seems... quite happy.

329
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,300
I wanted to ask you something.

330
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,430
I heard you have a girlfriend now.

331
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,550
No, they're just making that up.

332
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,500
Hurry up.

333
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,200
Let me tell you.

334
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,220
For a man, you know,

335
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,920
you should get married first

336
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,720
and then establish your career.

337
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,120
When I was your age,

338
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,340
how old were you at that time?

339
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,940
You were already 8 years old.

340
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,030
9 years old.

341
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,240
8!

342
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,450
Fine, 8 it is.

343
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,130
9, then.

344
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,740
How's work lately?

345
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
It's okay.

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,460
What do you mean by "okay"?

347
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,840
I've heard everything.

348
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,800
The funding for this year's research project

349
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,170
hasn't been approved yet, right?

350
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,640
Am I right?

351
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,540
And your grandfather isn't helping you either.

352
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,810
Though he can't really help with that.

353
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,350
You

354
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,830
just didn't listen to me

355
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,030
and insisted on studying TCM.

356
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,240
You even selected

357
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,160
such a niche research area.

358
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,120
If you had listened to me earlier, it wouldn't have come to this.

359
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,250
But it's not too late now.

360
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,390
Be a good boy and listen to me.

361
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,440
After the New Year, I'll use my connections for you.

362
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,490
You can go into...

363
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
pharmaceutical research and development.

364
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,720
The work is easier,

365
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,230
and the salary is much, much higher than

366
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,770
what you earn at that small clinic each week.

367
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

368
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,540
I guess when it comes to getting married first and then establishing a career,

369
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,010
I'm definitely far behind you.

370
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,480
How about this?

371
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,070
From now on, I won't come back for New Year's.

372
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,800
I'll spend New Year's with my grandfather in Hang City. How's that?

373
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,040
My son has grown up.

374
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,680
My son has truly grown up.

375
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,000
He asked me to wish you a Happy New Year on his behalf.

376
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,380
Why are you suddenly video-calling me?

377
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,550
I missed you.

378
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,600
Suye!

379
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,720
Happy New Year, and wishing you wealth and prosperity!

380
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,590
Happy New Year.

381
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,680
Are you alone in the room?

382
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,140
I just finished eating and came back to rest.

383
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,880
Where are you dining?

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,070
At Chun's, my dad booked a private room a month in advance.

385
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,440
They have many new dishes this year.

386
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
I've heard they're quite delicious.

387
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,440
That sounds nice.

388
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,750
When you come back, we'll come here again together.

389
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,550
Okay.

390
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,030
Grandpa?

391
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,310
Which dish do you like the most?

392
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,400
Among their new dishes,

393
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,070
there's a fish soup that's quite good.

394
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,160
Add some vinegar, and it's very appetizing.

395
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
You should try it when you come back.

396
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,010
Suye, we have to go now.

397
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,840
Grandpa Yu, come on, let's continue the meal.

398
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,230
Alright.

399
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,350
After I come back in a couple of days,

400
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,750
I'll come to your house for New Year's greetings.

401
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,680
Okay, welcome, welcome.

402
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,110
Welcome, welcome.

403
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,520
Suye, I won't say much more.

404
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,110
Enjoy your time over there.

405
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,030
You only visit there a few days each year, right?

406
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,470
No matter what happens,

407
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,820
just smile and let it go.

408
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,160
Happy New Year to you.

409
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,850
Happy birthday.

410
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,570
Thank you, Grandpa.

411
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,940
Bye-bye.

412
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,490
Bye-bye.

413
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,160
Zhao Ze, the boy you gave the Transformer to before,

414
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,890
asked me to wish you a Happy New Year on his behalf.

415
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,030
Happy New Year.

416
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,930
Happy New Year.

417
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,830
Congratulations to the little one on his recovery,

418
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,030
and to Dr. He for his benevolence and excellent medical skills.

419
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,920
In the new year, I wish Dr. He peace and joy,

420
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,380
may everything go well, and may your healing hands continue to work wonders.

421
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,960
That sounds

422
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,750
a bit too formal, doesn't it?

423
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,680
Hello?

424
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,030
Happy New Year.

425
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,270
Happy New Year.

426
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,830
Why did you...

427
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,510
suddenly call me?

428
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,550
Didn't you wish me that everything goes well?

429
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,590
This is one of those things.

430
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,350
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

431
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,640
No.

432
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
That's good then.

433
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,830
What...

434
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,440
what are you doing?

435
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,720
I'm at home watching the Spring Festival Gala with my parents.

436
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,520
How about you?

437
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,920
I...

438
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,920
I just got back to my hometown

439
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,760
and finished the New Year's Eve dinner with my relatives.

440
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,420
I've just returned to my room.

441
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,190
You went back to your hometown?

442
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,790
Yes, I forgot to tell you that.

443
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,310
It's okay.

444
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,350
He Suye.

445
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,250
When you come back after the New Year,

446
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,910
you'll receive our company's New Year gift box.

447
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,070
Thanks to you,

448
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,720
this year's medicinal cuisine for the New Year's Eve dinner has been especially popular.

449
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
It sold very well.

450
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,670
Is that so?

451
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,310
That's good then.

452
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,860
Your hometown is in Hu City, right?

453
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,070
Yeah.

454
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,290
How did you know?

455
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,680
When you signed the consulting contract before,

456
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,640
I vaguely remembered seeing it on your ID card.

457
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,350
Yes, I almost forgot.

458
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,630
My parents are calling me.

459
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,480
Then, I'll go out and join them.

460
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,140
Okay.

461
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,310
Okay.

462
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,270
Shen Xifan?

463
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,030
I wish you, in the new year...

464
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,310
that all your dreams come true...

465
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,520
and that everything goes as you desire.

466
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,070
Then I also wish you...

467
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,510
in the new year,

468
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,410
that all your dreams come true...

469
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,000
and that everything...

470
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,270
goes as you desire.

471
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,270

Happy birthday.

480
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,350
Make a wish.

481
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,960
You know what my wish is.

482
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,060
Okay.

483
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
I've made my wish.

484
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,260
How am I supposed to

485
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,770
blow out this candle?

486
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
Just give it a blow.

487
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,710
Okay.

488
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,030
Happy birthday.

489
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,210
Congratulations on growing another year older.

490
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,060
I can finally see it clearly.

491
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,070
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,560
This is all I have at home right now.

493
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,440
I couldn't buy a cake during the New Year holiday.

494
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,550
It's a bit simple.

495
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,480
What made you decide to celebrate my birthday?

496
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,970
I'll be back on the third day of the New Year.

497
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,880
What?

498
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,030
I said...

499
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,720
I'll be back on the third day of the New Year.

507
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
things will only get better.

Good morning.

516
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,150
Are you going out?

517
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,760
Just going for a walk around town

518
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,800
to see if anyone needs medical help.

519
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,580
Let's have breakfast.

520
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,360
He,

521
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,440
thank you so much.

522
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,180
My mother's leg

523
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,110
has been hurting all winter.

524
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,110
She couldn't even walk anymore.

525
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,800
How much do you charge?

526
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,710
That's not necessary.

527
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,760
It was just a simple acupuncture treatment.

528
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,960
No charge. Just tell your mother to be more careful from now on.

529
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
Well, thank you then.

530
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,400
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

531
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,030
I'm off then.

532
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,800
Goodbye.
