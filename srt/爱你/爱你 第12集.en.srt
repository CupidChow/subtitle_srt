What am I doing?

I'm just here to ask him help have a look at my application.

What am I thinking about?

6
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,300
Here, have some soup.

7
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,300
This is chicken soup, you know.

8
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,140
Okay.

9
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,820
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

10
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,329
That's enough.

Mom.

13
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
I've already sent my application materials

14
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,150
to the study abroad agency.

15
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,210
They will forward them to the school.

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,030
That's good.

17
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,680
At least one thing is done.

18
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,550
What did the agency say?

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,480
Do they think you can get the offer?

20
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,360
I've added all the practical cases

21

from this period.

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,610
The agency said the content is quite rich.

23
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,500
I just hope it gets approved now.

24
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,260
Sounds like there's hope.

25
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,630
Keep it up.

26
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,040
Okay.

27
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,050

31
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,970
Thank you.

32

Oh right,

33
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,630
what did the agency contact you about today?

34
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,230
Did they need any materials?

35
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,030
There's no problem with the materials,

36
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,690
just some minor edits needed.

37
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,630
So, if you get the offer,

38
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,890

It's very meaningful.

71

Breast cancer

72
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,310
is one of the most common tumors among women.

73
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,760
However,

74
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,160
though it has the highest incidence rate,

75
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,190
breast cancer

76
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,710
is preventable, treatable, and curable.

77
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,880
At present, in our country,

78
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,590
we have already established a relatively complete and mature system

79
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,960
for early screening and treatment

80
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,710
of breast cancer,

81
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,350
which benefits many women.

82

Yes.

Besides,

93
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,760
this is also

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,290
the reason why we choose this topic this time.

101
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,910
If you have another date today,

102
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,230
don't waste any time.

103
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,520

106
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,680
It's not a date.

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,480
I'm just meeting her to discuss something.

108
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,010

109
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,960

111
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,910
At home?

112
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,990
It's nothing. It's just that...

113
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,850
we live in the same neighborhood,

114
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,159
so it's more convenient to talk at home.

115
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,679
Yes.

116
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,600
It's more convenient at home.

117
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,150
It's more convenient at home.

118
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,210
There's no cafe in the neighborhood.

119
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,850
No cafe, huh?

120
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,680
I'm still pursuing her.

121
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,680
Still what?

122
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,850
Still pursuing her.

123
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,530
You're still...

124
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,280
Have you won her over?

125
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,790
Since I'm still pursuing her, how could I have won her over?

126
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,990
You pursued her all the way to her house?

127
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,230

128

130
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,430
Go for it, Dr. He.

131
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,270
You can do it, Dr. He.

132
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,560
I was wondering why you didn't go to the blind date event

133
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,470
last time.

134
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,050
Turns out, you already have someone in mind.

135
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,750
You guys really like gossip.

136
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,550
It's alright.

137
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,080
I guess everyone in the hospital knows by now?

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Basically, yeah.

139
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
Is she pretty?

140
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,350
Let's have dinner sometime,

141
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,010
and you should ask her out so we can check her out.

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,610
Don't rush.

143
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,220
I haven't won her over yet.

144
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,700
Who is she? Which girl is so hard to pursue?

145
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,470
Got a photo?

146
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,470
I'll help you analyze it

147
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,870
and give you some advice.

148
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,080
You?

149
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,310
Give me some advice?

150
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,320
Save it.

151
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,400
Are you looking down on me?

152
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,730
I'm quite experienced.

153
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,040
Really.

154
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,160
Let me take a look!

155
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,520
Let me check out the news.

156
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,560
This one's interesting.

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,440
Most of today's post-1995 generation are single

158
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,040
because their social circles are too small.

159
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,800
They prefer staying at home,

160
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,060
don't socialize much,

161
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,400
are busy with work,

162
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,400
and have really high standards for a partner.

163
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,680
Ms. Liu, look at this news.

164
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,630
It's a vicious cycle, you know?

165
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,230
Really?

166
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,090
Think about it.

167
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,470
You don't socialize,

168
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,110
so your social circle is inevitably small,

169
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,590
but your standards for a partner

170
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,790
are still super high.

171
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,800
This news really

172
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,230

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,200
Why are you yelling?

174
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,230
You're putting pressure on our Ms. Shen.

175
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm not.

176
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm sorry, Ms. Shen.

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
Can you learn from me?

178
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,990
Since the last time she went on a blind date

179
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,590
with that little TCM guy and it didn't work out,

180
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,320
did I mention it?

181
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:44,800
No.

182
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,710
Did I mention it?

183
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,580
No, you didn't.

184
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,560
Whether he's a golden-collar worker in a foreign enterprise

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,990
or a tall, handsome guy

186
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,110
working in the government,

187
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,110
it's all useless.

188
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,280
You can't force it.

189
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,960
True.

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,500
That's right.

191
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Wait.

192
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,430
Before concluding that it's forced,

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,870
she should look at the photo first.

194
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,750
Right? What if he gives a good impression?

195
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,350
Right?

196
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,960
Take a look at his photo.

197
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,680
Ms. Liu.

198
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,510
It...

199
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,380
Why are you talking to me?

200
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Talk to your dad.

201
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm not the one who read the news.

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Mr. Shen,

203
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,220
It doesn't...

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
seem appropriate, does it?

205
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,580
What's wrong?

206
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,860
What if his goal is marriage?

207
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,640
But what about me? I'm going abroad to study.

208
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,750
That will be a huge gap

209
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,120
between the two of us.

210
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,400
It's not appropriate.

211
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,920
That makes sense.

212
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,960
That...

213
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,400
Wait.

214
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,160
Make sense?

215
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,710
Really?

216
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,320
Does it make sense?

217
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,560
No.

218
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,200
Yes, it does make sense.

219
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,960
It makes a bit of sense.

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,560
You see,

221
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,040
what Ms. Shen is thinking about is life planning.

222
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
So,

223
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,130
we should look at the photo first.

224
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,630
Let's look at the photo.

225
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,030
The photo is...

226
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,240
here.

227
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,570
What are you doing?

228
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,920
I forgot to open it earlier,

229
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,310
and the photo has expired.

230
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,630
Look.

231
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,630
B-But...

232
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,380
But...

233
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
you can still see

234
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,280
his general shape.

235
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:13,860
Ms. Shen.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,960
Ms. Shen.

237
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,400
Let me take a look at his general shape.

238
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,690
Square-shaped, not bad.

239
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,920
Ms. Shen,

240
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,440
I'll send you his name

241
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,710
and phone number now.

242
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,080
Also,

243
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,200
I've made an appointment for you.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,570
I'll send you the name of the restaurant.

245
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,630
Remember to be there on Friday night.

246
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,360
You made an appointment so soon?

247
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,440
Is it too soon?

248
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,260
Is it too soon?

249
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,620
Is Friday too soon?

250
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,420
We naturally made

251
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,370
the appointment.

252
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,370
It's not even today.

253
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,460
I don't think it's too soon.

254
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,180
Yeah.

255
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,590
This is great.

256
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,720
Let's read more news

257
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,330
while eating in the future.

258
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,830
I'll have to deal with them again.

259
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Ms. Liu,

260
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,630
why hasn't the guy I'm on the blind date with

261
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,040
come yet?

262
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,740
Ask him for me.

263
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,490
Hello, Miss.

264
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,050
Would you like to order now?

265
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,040
Sorry.

266
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,440
My friend is not here yet.

267
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
Can you wait a little longer?

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,710
He's late?

269
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,110
Let me ask him.

270
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,660
Miss,

271
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,870
have some candies first.

272
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,200
Take your time.

273
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,680
Thank you.

274
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,750
Xiangya,

275
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,880
this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.

276
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,540
I got stood up on my blind date.

277
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,830
How about coming out and hanging out with me later?

278
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,710
Ms. Shen,

279
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,230
I can't reach him.

280
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,510
Why don't you leave first?

281
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,500
Find a nice restaurant

282
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,640
and eat something delicious.

283
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,130
I already gave that matchmaker a good scolding.

284
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,440
He's so rude.

285
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,200
Manager Shen.

286
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,170
Li Jie.

287
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,560
What a coincidence.

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Why are you here?

289
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm here to meet a friend.

290
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,630
Why are you here?

291
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,170
We're having a class reunion.

292
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,400
Well, have fun at the reunion.

293
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,630
I'm going out to find a place to eat.

294
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,670
It's a little expensive here.

295
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,470
Wait a minute.

296
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Suye asked

297
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
if you want to join us.

298
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,030
I saw Manager Shen.

299
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,870
Excuse me.

300
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,630
Hello.

301
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,860
My friend probably won't come.

303
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,220
May I just pay the bill?

304
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,990
Here?

305
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,040
How would you like to pay?

306
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,710
She got stood up.

307
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,840
WeChat pay, please.

308
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,200
Okay.

309
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,110
Scan this.

310
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,630
Isn't it inappropriate?

311
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,800
It's your reunion. I shouldn't be there.

312
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,350
There's nothing inappropriate.

313
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,280
We're colleagues and classmates.

314
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,520
Everyone is easy to get along with.

315
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,830
Come on.

316
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,590
Don't hesitate.

317
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,990
Let's hang out together.

318
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,230
I'll just...

319
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,160
Don't reject me.

320
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,090
Okay.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,770
Let's go. That private room.

322
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,220
Okay.

323
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,700
Just walk straight ahead.

324
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,140
We ordered a lot of dishes.

325
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,319
It's Suye's treat today.

326
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,819
When you introduce Manager Shen, say she's your friend,

327
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,280
in case people make a fuss.

328
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,150
Li Jie,

329
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,310
what's wrong?

330
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,020
Nothing. Let's go.

331
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,730
This room.

332
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,280
This one?

333
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,390
Excuse me,

334
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,070
waitress.

335
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,550
Please bring me two more bottles of Tuopai Teji.

336
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,230
We must drink to our heart's content today.

337
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,400
We must drink heartily today.

338
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,360
You're drunk.

339
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,400
It's for fun. We're here today to have fun, aren't we?

340
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,000
Everyone,

341
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,750
I brought a friend here.

342
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,280
Let me introduce her.

343
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,500
This is Shen Xifan.

344
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,690
She's a friend of mine.

345
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,270
She's here for dinner, but there are no tables available.

346
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,070
So I brought her here to join us for a meal.

347
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,600
Hope you don't mind.

348
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,570
Sorry to bother.

349
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,400
Welcome! Welcome!

350
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,710
We warmly welcome you!

351
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,790
Welcome!

352
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,120
We warmly welcome you!

353
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,160
Good!

354
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,890
Welcome, welcome!

355
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,310
These are all my seniors and juniors

356
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,920
from the oncology department.

357
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,840
They are all very nice people,

358
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,880
very easy to get along with.

359
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,680
That's right.

360
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,550
Well...

361
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,640
let me make a formal introduction.

362
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,400
I am

363
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,360
his senior.

364
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,510
People always say doctors are benevolent.

365
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,830
We're really super kind.

366
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,690
Come, sit here.

367
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,070
Fang.

368
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,790
Fang?

369
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,240
Don't you think it's a bit crowded?

370
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,120
Move over a little.

371
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,750
Sit here.

372
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,360
Thank you.

373
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,400
Excuse me.

374
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,270
Please bring one more set of utensils.

375
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,330
And one more chair.

376
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,950
I'll go hurry her up.

377
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,840
Fang,

378
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,310
take care of her.

379
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,990
I'm sorry for the trouble.

380
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,190
Please wait a moment.

381
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,640
It's been a long time since we last gathered.

382
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,030
Let's all have a drink together.

383
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,360
Come on, come on.

384
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:14,920
Cheers.

385
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,880
Bottoms up.

386
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,030
Bottoms up.

387
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,750
Finally, everyone's here.

388
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,510
It's the first time.

389
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,120
Yes, yes.

390
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
Drink a little more.

391
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,470
Later, let's go to

392
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,360
the after-party.

393
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,710
Are you treating us to the after-party?

394
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,790
Can you treat us to the after-party?

395
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,840
Of course.

396
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,710
Hey,

397
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,030
Miss Shen.

398
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,750
I heard you're working at Gunan Huating Hotel.

399
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,360
Yes.

400
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,230
The fact that you work there shows you're capable.

401
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,880
No, no.

402
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,890
I can't compare to you guys.

403
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,890
Modest. You're being modest again.

404
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,310
Your modesty makes me want to ask,

405
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,370
how did you and Li know each other?

406
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,750
We worked together

407
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,120
on a traditional Chinese medicine project before.

408
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,160
We hired him as a consultant.

409
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,990
Oh, I know that.

410
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,080
I know that. I know that.

411
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,110
I remember that project was led by He, right?

412
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,470
Yes.

413
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Dr. He was also in the team at the time.

414
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,470
We've all met before.

415
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,730
And Fang was there too.

416
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,680
Speaking of He...

417
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,470
This is from Senior He.

418
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,810
Thank you.

419
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,580
Lotus.

420
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,490
I want to eat Tangyuan too.

421
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,530
Lo...

422
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,920
I've been drinking.

423
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,230
My stomach hurts. As you know,

424
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,950
my stomach's always been bad.

425
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:35,510
Alright, alright.

426
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,600
Give it to me.

427
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,270
How many?

428
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,070
Before I decide,

429
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,480
I have something to say.

430
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,750
You can't

431
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,380
just take care of our new friend

432
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,460
and forget about me, your old friend.

433
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,560
That'll really break my heart.

434
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,360
How many?

435
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,140
Six.

436
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,460
You eat this much and still can't get a girlfriend.

437
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm eating this much just to find a girlfriend.

438
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,510
As the old saying goes,

439
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,440
a big body doesn't lack strength, right?

440
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,270
Okay.

441
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,140
I found that

442
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,330
you guys are only eating but not drinking.

443
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,030
How about this?

444
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,230
Let's play a game to spice things up,

445
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,960
alright?

446
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,540
Let's play Continue the Prescription.

447
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,990
-Okay.
-Okay.

448
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,400
Okay.

449
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
We're having a great time here.

450
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,120
And you want to review professional knowledge?

451
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,550
Exactly.

452
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,350
Are you trying to outwork us all?

453
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,160
This is called "with good wine to lift the mood,

454
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,680
we must drink in moderation."

455
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,880
We can't just focus on having fun.

456
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,960
We should also take the knowledge from our genes

457
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,990
and refresh it, air it out,

458
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,030
and sort it through.

459
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,880
Continue the Prescription is too difficult.

460
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
What about Miss Shen?

461
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,360
How about this?

462
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,860
Let's change the rule.

463
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,840
Continue...

464
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,050
the Medication?

465
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,690
She should be able to do it.

466
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,400
I'll give it a try.

467
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,880
Good.

468
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,360
How about this?

469
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,470
If the rest of us can't continue,

470
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,020
we'll take a shot.

471
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,750
If Miss Shen can't, she'll just have a little, alright?

472
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,270
Sounds good. That's how it should be.

473
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,570
It must be like this.

474
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,830
-Okay, I'll start.
-Come on.

475
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,790
Gui Zhi.

476
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,370
Gui Pi.

477
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,050
Pomegranate peel.

478
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,230
Pomegranate peel?

479
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,070
That doesn't count!

480
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,200
That doesn't count!

481
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,570
Pomegranate peel?

482
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,400
Pomegranate peel doesn't count.

483
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,790
Alright, alright.

484
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,640
I didn't bring the Chinese Pharmacopoeia today.

485
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,840
Otherwise, I'd let you know

486
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,880
what pomegranate peel is.

487
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,540
I'll drink.

488
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,230
What is he talking about?

489
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,270
Let's stop talking.

490
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,790
One, two, three, four.

491
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,470
Bai Shao.

492
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,880
Shao Yao!

493
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,200
Let's start with another one.

494
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,730
Hurry up.

495
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,120
Su He Xiang!

496
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,890
Su...

497
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,510
Su Ye!

498
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,550
Su Ye?

499
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,790
What is Su Ye?

500
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,440
What is Su Ye?

501
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,510
If Su Ye counts,

502
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,680
then my pomegranate peel counts too,

503
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,120
right?

504
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,990
Pomegranate...

505
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,510
Su Ye

506
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,880
counts.

507
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,920
It doesn't.

508
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,360
Am I a clown or what?

509
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,160
There's no problem.

510
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,510
Am I overthinking it?

511
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,010
Why did you come out?

512
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,130
There are too many people in the room.

513
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,440
I was afraid you might feel uncomfortable and want to leave,

514
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
so...

515
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,030
Everyone is nice.

516
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,480
Don't worry.

517
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,510
Let's go back in.

518
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,150
Okay.

519
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,790
Tonight...

520
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,870
who stood you up?

521
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,880
You usually go straight home

522
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,630
after work.

523
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,260
Who were you going to meet tonight?

524
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,360
A friend.

525
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,150
A blind date?

526
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,980
Looks like I guessed right.

527
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,000
But that's fine.

528
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,140
You got stood up

529
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,390
and didn't get to see him.

530
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,600
Let's...

531
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,730
go home together tonight.

532
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,740
I didn't drink,

533
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,670
so I can drive.

534
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,310
Let's go.

535
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,980
Are you happy, Suye?

536
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm happy!

537
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,350
Sing a song.

538
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,760
You can do it.

539
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,720
Come on, sing a song.

540
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,540
Caifang, can you sing?

541
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,960
Sing a song!

542
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,640
Come on!

543
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,510
You can do it!

544
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,400
I caught you two.

545
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,590
You're avoiding drinking

546
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,070
and hiding in the corner.

547
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:04,750
That's unacceptable.

548
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,530
You must be punished.

549
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
Either drink three shots of white wine

550
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,880
or play truth or dare.

551
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,360
I can't drink.

552
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,600
That's great.

553
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,990
Lotus,

554
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,040
drink for her.

555
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,860
I can't.

556
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,510
Six shots of white wine

557
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,640
for six Tangyuans.

558
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,390
I can't. I have to drive later.

559
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,990
What?

560
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,760
How about truth or dare?

561
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,710
Yeah!

562
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,030
Truth!

563
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,470
I'll drink, I'll drink.

564
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,270
Hold on.

565
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
I...

566
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,200
I chose truth.

567
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,710
Wonderful!

568
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,440
Here's the question.

569
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,990
There's a rumor going around the hospital that you have a crush now.

570
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,500
Is that true?

571
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,960
Yes.

572
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,470
What?

573
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,510
You're pretty cool.

574
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,560
You just said yes.

575
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,360
Does that mean

576
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,440
the only one left single now is me?

577
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,120
Wait a second.

578
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,510
Who is it?

579
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,360
Who is it?

580
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,070
Who's the girl?

581
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,360
Do I know her?

582
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,680
I need to hurry up and remind her

583
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,790
to switch to a cassia seed pillow.

584
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,360
I want her to clear the heat and improve her eyesight

585
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,880
so she can see your true face.

586
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,030
What true face?

587
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,310
We agreed on one question at a time.

588
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,510
You've asked one, so it's over now.

589
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,680
It's not over. Come on.

590
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,270
Just tell us.

591
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,470
Who is it?

592
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,470
Who is it?

593
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,270
Just tell us.

594
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,710
Well...

595
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,920
It's...

596
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
It's just a girl I met in April.

597
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,920
A girl you met in April?

598
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,360
Did you hear that?

599
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,790
-April.
-Did you hear that?

600
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,990
Did you hear that?

601
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,880
What is it?

602
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,600
What April?

603
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,930
It's still a little cold in April. Remember to dress warmly.

604
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,110
Sorry.

605
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,240
Did I hit you?

606
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,630
I'm fine.

607
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,100
I'm sorry.

608
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,590
I was in the hospital in April.

609
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,340
How could I not know?

610
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,200
How could I let you get her?

611
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm even more confused now.

612
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,880
Be careful.

613
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,590
Senior He,

614
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,960
how about I take Manager Shen home for you?

615
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,070
It's okay. I live in the same neighborhood as her.

616
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,400
I'll just send her home.

617
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,510
Look behind you.

618
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,680
There are so many people who need you to take care of.

619
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,440
I won't go home.

620
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,960
Li Jie.

621
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,600
Li Jie!

622
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,200
I'll leave the rest of them to you and Fang!

623
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,710
Okay!

624
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,680
Be careful.

625
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,340
Let me do it.

626
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,480
We're leaving.

627
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,200
I'll do it.

628
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,890
Watch the steps.

629
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,430
Be careful.

630
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,230
You're drunk.

631
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,200
Thank you for liking me.

632
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,940
What?

633
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
I said...

634
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,640
thank you for liking me.

635
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,610
You're drunk.

636
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,180
I'm not.

637
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,960
What did you just say?

638
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,030
Say it again.

639
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,990
I said...

640
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,640
thank you for liking me.

641
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,120
Mr. Shen?

642
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,960
What's going on here?

643
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,440
Ms. Shen,

644
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,840
what happened to you?

645
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,590
There's such a strong smell of alcohol.

646
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,990
It's...

647
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,310
What happened?

648
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,120
I've been drinking.

649
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,880
Come on, you...

650
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,790
You've been drinking again?

651
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,070
How could you drink again?

652
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,030
Come on, come on.

653
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,640
Help her get in.

654
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,970
Be careful. Be careful.

655
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,290
-Sir.
-Be careful.

656
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,510
Who are you?

657
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,470
I'm a friend of Xifan.

658
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
Well, thank you then.

659
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,200
You're welcome.

660
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,020
Let me see the guest off first.

661
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,630
Well, I'll leave now.

662
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,270
Thank you.

663
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:05,840
Okay.

664
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Well...

665
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,590
You're leaving just like that?

666
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,400
You must be exhausted

667
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,590
from bringing our daughter back.

668
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,360
How about you come in and sit for a while?

669
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,960
Would you like to have some late-night snacks?

670
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,280
Make some

671
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,320
late-night snacks.

672
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,449
Would you like some?

673
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,710
I won't eat.

674
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,469
I'm going back to rest first.

675
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,520
Alright.

676
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,070
Alright.

677
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,670
Thank you.

678
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,620
Thank you, Ma'am.

679
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,350
How much did she drink?

680
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:29,300
Exactly.

681
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

682
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,730
How did you like the medicinal dishes you had before?

683
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,870
Xifan asked me to make a few prescriptions,

684
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,400
saying that you two would have them together.

685
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,560
You're that Dr. He, right?

686
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,850
Yes.

687
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,840
I finally met you in person.

688
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,360
Those medicinal dishes were so delicious.

689
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:47,880
Really?

690
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,340
Our whole family loved it.

691
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,030
If we make them again, you should come and have some with us.

692
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,590
We can have a family banquet together.

693
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,110
Sure.

694
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,810
I happen to also live in this neighborhood.

695
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,760
When it's convenient for you,

696
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,630
just let Xifan send me a message on WeChat.

697
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,760
What a coincidence!

698
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,280
We live so close.

699
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,380
Great.

700
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
Feel free to come over for a meal whenever you have time.

701
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,630
Well, I won't disturb you any longer today.

702
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,360
I'm leaving now.

703
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,150
Alright, alright.

704
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,240
Feel free to come over for a meal whenever you have time.

705
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Come over to hang out when you have time.

706
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,960
Sure, sure.

707
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,720
Bye bye.

708
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
Goodbye.

709
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,840
Good night.

710
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,760
My goodness, he's so handsome.

711
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,650
I don't need to arrange blind dates for her anymore.

712
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,560
That young man

713
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,030
is tall, fair-skinned,

714
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,030
and well-mannered.

715
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,280
And he's very polite.

716
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,990
Yes. He took such good care of our daughter.

717
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,540
Look at you.

718
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,330
Are you throwing up? How much did you drink?

719
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:39,770
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

720
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,870
I'll get you some water.

721
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:48,130
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

722
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,440
Just take this to pay the fee.

723
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,240
Okay, okay.

724
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,030
Thank you, doctor.

725
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,510
It's fine.

726
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,720
I'll come back next week.

727
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,760
Alright.

728
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:55,960
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

729

♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

730
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,470
Are you awake?

731
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,070
Your alcohol tolerance is terrible.

732
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,650
♫A gentle breeze begins to rise♫

733
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,320
It's this late, and you still haven't woken up.

734
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:12,480
♫You'll see a rainbow♫

735
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,710
♫Hovering in mid-air♫

736
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,430
♫This sweet dream♫

737

♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

741
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,990
I've prescribed you some medicine. See you later.

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:53,290
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

♫Lololove and sunshine♫

747
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,990
Still not awake?

748
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,370
I'm already downstairs.

749
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,430
Hurry up and come down.

750
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,090
I've got your medicine ready.

751
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,240
You're down?

752
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,920
What's wrong with you?

753
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,180
Still not fully awake?

754
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,030
You had to drink so much last night.

755
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,890
You downed each shot in two gulps.

756
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,720
I thought you were a tough girl.

757
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,110
What's wrong?

758
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,440
Are you feeling unwell?

759
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,880
The person you said

760
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,550
you met in April last night—

761
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,470
was it me?

762
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,740
Of course.

763
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,650
This is what you've been doubting?

764
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,110
Haven't I made it obvious enough?

765
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,030
Before,

766
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,440
I felt the timing wasn't right,

767
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,300
so I didn't say it directly.

768
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,240
Last night, there were too many people,

769
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,590
and I didn't want you to feel awkward,

770
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,650
so I didn't make it very clear either.

771
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,440
However,

772
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,130
I can tell you again, properly.

773
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,760
Shen Xifan,

774
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,820
I like you.
