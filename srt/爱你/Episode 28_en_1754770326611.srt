3
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,039
Here's the thing.

4
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,979
As you know,

5
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,470
my global internship ends next week.

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,170
But I got a new opportunity.

7
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,720
A two-month internship
at a six-star hotel.

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,620
There are only five spots available.

9
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,370
I think it's a rare opportunity,

10
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,690
so I applied.

11
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,710
Already?

12
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,720
No, just now.

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,949
It was just this noon.

14
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,360
He Suye, are you angry?

15
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,230
Don't be mad.

16
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,450
I didn't mean to not discuss it with you.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,440
I just thought it was a rare opportunity,

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,810
so I wanted to apply and give it a try.

19
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,070
I might not even be able to get it, really.

20
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,110
It seems you don't want to come back

21
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,530
or see me at all.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,760
No, I miss you very much.

23
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,640
I want to go back and see you right away.

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,240
It's just two months, right?

25
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,130
Alright then.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,860
After all, I was the one who encouraged you to study abroad.

27
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,300
But let me tell you,

28
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,000
you'll have to tell Mr. and Mrs. Shen yourself.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm not going to say anything.

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,250
Don't worry.

31
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,900
I'll definitely tell them.

32
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,200
What about the visa? Has it come through?

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,390
I've been looking into third-country visas these days.

34
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,250
There shouldn't be any problems.

35
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,510
It should be approved.

36
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,750
Alright.

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,880
Which hotel are you going to?

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,940
Do you have the details?

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,740
Of course I do.

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,890
Wait a moment, I'll go find it for you.

147
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,150

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,500
I want half of the fish.

156
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,750
The entire fish is yours.

157
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,770

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,510
I am being gentle.

160
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,370
It's making me itch just doing it.

161
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,800
Don't move while I'm cleaning your ears.

162
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,470
I just wanted to ask...

163
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,070
Has the area where you had surgery gotten better?

164
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,340
Does it still hurt?

165
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,870
Of course it's better.

166
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,500
Look at how energetic I am. Does it look like I haven't recovered?

167
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,140
Since I had that surgery,

168
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,070
He has been making me drink Chinese medicine every day.

169
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,710
Your dad prepares the medicine.

170
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,510
I also have to go for a check-up every three months.

171
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,270
I'm incredibly healthy now.

172
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,530
Alright.

173
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,620
Then,

174
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,700
I'll have to appease him later.

175
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,150
Why do you need to do that?

176
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,880
In our family, your dad is the one who appeases me.

177
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,650
Then you...

178
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,410
It's time to cook the fish!

179
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,220
Let's see.

180
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
I eat dinner because I weigh a lot.

181
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,980
In that case, shouldn't you eat less dinner

182
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,410
to lose weight?

183
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,760
As a doctor, you know...

184
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,220
High basal metabolism.

185
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,640
Food is the most important thing for the people.

186
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,970
If you don't eat, you...

187
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,530
♫When I see you♫

188
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,740
♫Flowers bloom♫

189
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,300
♫When I see you♫

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,980
Isn't she your precious girlfriend?

191
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,870
She's back in the country, huh?

192
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,080
Yes, she just got back a couple of days ago.

193
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,740
♫Flowers bloom♫

194
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,710
It's really true that absence makes the heart grow fonder.

195
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,840
You have to meet up even just for lunch.

196
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,790
It really is.

197
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,780
What do you know?

198
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,800
♫And I don't even know where else to go♫

199
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,010
I know.

200
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,310
Disappear immediately.

201
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,460
Let's go.

202
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,580
It's not that I don't know.

203
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,340
He disappears, I haven't eaten.

204
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,670
I'll treat you.

205
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,740
You disappear on your own, what does that have to do with me?

206
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,390
♫And I don't even know where else to go♫

207
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,510
♫When I see you♫

208
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,690
♫Flowers bloom♫

209
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:57,550
♫Nothing in this world can take me away from you♫

210
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,290
♫When I'm with you♫

211
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,310
♫When I'm with you♫

212
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,750
This... This is the hospital.

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,050
It's not good if people see us.

214
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,860
Look, there are people over there.

215
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,950
Alright.

216
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,780
Tell me why you're here.

217
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,740
To have a meal with you, of course.

218
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,440
Can't you wait until I'm off work to eat?

219
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,250
No.

220
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
That's not right.

221
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,620
What exactly do you want to do?

222
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,110
Me?

223
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,880
I just want to take advantage of when your girlfriend isn't around

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,010
to swoop in

225
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,690
and invade your life.

226
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,140
L-Lower your voice.

227
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

228
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,190
There are so many people here.

229
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,850
It'll be bad if people hear it.

230
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,960
How would it be bad?

231
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,060
I didn't register for your appointment

232
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,350
or go to your clinic.

233
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,100
I'm not affecting your work at all.

234
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,210
What do you think? Am I a good girl?

235
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,570
Fine.

236
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,610
You win.

237
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:35,910
Welcome.

238
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,710
Come.

239
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,260
Thank you.

240
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,270
You're welcome.

241
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,310
Eat the cherries.

242
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,150
Rose.

243
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,100
New products have arrived.

244
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,280
-It’s not launched yet.
-It’s beautiful.

245
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,960
It’s so fancy.

246
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,850
Boss Xu is personally serving us.

247
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,310
This is my supplier after all.

248
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,240
Of course, I have to treat him well.

249
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,660
Indeed, they look good.

250
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,400
Look how nice this photo is.

251
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,339
Please, don't send it out.

252
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,310
Don't affect my new product launch, okay?

253
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
It seems like Boss Xu wants

254
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,030
the supply prices to be raised, huh?

255
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,750
No, no, no.

256
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,380
Don't do this.

257
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,510
My small shop hasn't broken even yet.

258
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,339
Please be merciful.

259
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,950
No, it depends on Boss Xu's attitude.

260
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:25,990
Please, please, please.

261
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,050
Alright, alright.

262
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,950
Today, I've called everyone here

263
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,550
because there's something I want to announce.

264
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,110
Xiangya and I have decided to run this business together.

265
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,100
That's so sudden.

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,140
It's not sudden. We've been considering it for a long time.

267
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,030
So you're not going back to the hotel?

268
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:42,900
No.

269
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,900
During my study abroad,

270
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,580
I also studied many business cases.

271
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,070
I have

272
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,660
always wanted to create

273
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,860
a brand with its own unique characteristics.

274
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,380
Xiangya's business happens to have it.

275
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,660
That is, traditional Chinese medicine.

276
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,720
But it lacks systematic management.

277
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,180
So I plan to come and apply what I've learned.

278
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,090
The two of us hit it off immediately.

279
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,820
We specifically studied

280
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,140
the current online trends.

281
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,140
We already have a preliminary plan.

282
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,930
You two have been up to quite a lot behind my back.

283
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,100
Did you know about this?

284
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,660
I didn't know.

285
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,520
It's my first time hearing it too.

286
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,630
But we can indeed give it a try.

287
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,030
After all, it's not like studying hotel management

288
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,960
means you have to go back to a hotel.

289
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,550
Look.

290
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,580
This time,

291
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,710
hasn't my girlfriend changed a lot?

292
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,420
What makes you say that?

293
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,030
What?

294
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,380
She's become prettier.

295
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,310
Prettier?

296
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,470
Pretty. Really pretty.

297
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,510
Pretty. Really pretty.

298
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,710
This tea is really good.

299
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,580
Try this.

300
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,310
Here.

301
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,540
Drink something hot.

302
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,240
Wow, chocolate!

303
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,830
He Suye,

304
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,270
it’s snowing.

305
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,720
Really?

306
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,710
It's so beautiful.

307
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,940
Last winter,

308
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,660
I don't think it snowed.

309
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,150
That's because I wasn't here last winter.

310
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,820
Look, I'm back this year and it's snowing.

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,730
It's the first snow of the year.

312
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,280
Then let me ask you.

313
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,070
How is the snow in Hang City

314
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,380
different from the snow in Switzerland?

315
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,040
Of course it's different.

316
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,310
The snow in Switzerland doesn't have you in it,

317
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,050
so it's especially cold.

318
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
But in the snow of Hang City,

319
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,440
you're here with me.

320
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,060
♫Your face♫

321
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,620

He Suye,

344
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,490
let's get married.

345
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,500
When spring comes next year,

346
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,110
let us

347
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,320
get married.

348
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,800
Wait.

349
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,710
During this year you've been studying abroad,

350
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,730
I've thought about so many things.

351
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:04,570
♫The moment I see you, all my worries turn transparent♫

352
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,870
Every day,

353
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,920
I want to wake up with you in the sunlight,

354
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:12,670
♫In the silence, the sound of my heartbeat grows clearer♫

355
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,400
fall asleep to the sound of rain,

356
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,600
run with you in the sunset,

357
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,230
and chat under the moonlight.

358
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,080
♫The entire world reflects in your eyes♫

359
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:26,730
♫Make a wish, can the snow fall slowly?♫

360
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,030
Just like this honeysuckle flower,

361
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,330
after this winter passes,

362
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,840
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

363
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,750
we will

364
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,980
be like two flowers on one stem,

365
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,990
♫Life is finally complete♫

366
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,150

♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

368
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,720

♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

370
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,160
and I'll give you

371
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,960
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

372
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,270
my life's love.

373
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,720
♫But I never said those words♫

374
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,280
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

375
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,190
♫When will love bloom into a flower?♫

376
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,950
Will you marry me?

377
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,910
♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

378
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,980
I do.

379
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,680
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

380
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,720
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

381
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,230
♫When each other's thoughts are exchanged♫

382
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,700
♫The warm light takes away all the noise♫

383
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,460
♫Only the two of us remain in the world♫

384
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,020
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

385
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,930
♫Love blooms quietly♫

386
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:52,000
♫Hold you close with a deep kiss♫

387

♫White lovers are answering♫

388
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:19,400
[Spring]

389
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,090
Let's take a photo.

390
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,510
It looks good.

391
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,190
Do you see how enthusiastically they were chatting?

392
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,860
Hello.

393
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,050
Xifan's uncle.

394
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,100
Actually, Dr. He and the bride

395
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,140
met while eating my spicy hot pot.

396
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Really?

397
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm not exaggerating.

398
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,030
So if I eat it, can I find a partner?

399
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,070
Don't worry. As long as you eat my spicy hot pot,

400
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,470
your love will come soon.

401
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,470
Really?

402
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,420
The weather is quite nice today.

403
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,200
Oh, indeed.

404
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,750
You've arrived early.

405
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,510
We'll have to change how we address each other now.

406
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,070
We're in-laws now.

407
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,620
In-law.

408
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,520
Mother-in-law.

409
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,750
You haven't met before, have you?

410
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,750
This is Wang.

411
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Hello.

412
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,510
This is Wang's son, Chang.

413
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,230
Hello.

414
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,900
Call him Uncle.

415
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,990
Call him Uncle.

416
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,620
Hello, Uncle.

417
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,020
You should call her Aunt.

418
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,140
Hello, Aunt.

419
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,030
Hello.

420
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,870
Ze, slow down.

421
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,140
Thank you.

422
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,710
Li.

423
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,070
Zhao Ze?

424
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,060
You have hair!

425
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,230
I told you last time.

426
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,470
How have you been feeling lately?

427
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,930
I've recovered very well.

428
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,620
My mom said

429
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,340
I should be able to participate in the sports meet next semester.

430
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,710
You're even participating in sports meets?

431
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,510
What's wrong?

432
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,060
I'm very strong, you know.

433
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,180
It's so hot, but keep up the good work.

434
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,340
Win a gold medal for me, okay?

435
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,820
Okay.

436
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,990
Let me see.

437
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:00,950
Boss.

438
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,580
Give me another one of those...

439
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,180
Boss.

440
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,380
Get me a spicy hot pot with instant noodles.

441
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,660
Extra spicy and numbing, thank you.

442
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,510
Hey.

443
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,850
Don't you know it's first come, first...

444
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,900
You,

445
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,950
quickly make a bowl of spicy hot pot for this young lady.

446
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,350
Extra spicy and numbing.

447
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,420
Okay.

448
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,580
Wow, 188 cm.

449
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,020
Hello.

450
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,840
My name is Song Feng.

451
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,660
Today's groom is my junior.

452
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,090
Miss.

453
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,340
Do you

454
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,320
dare to

455
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,430
add me on WeChat?

456
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,430
Sure.

457
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,230
Thank you.

458
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,400
Am I handsome?

459
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
You take after me.

460
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,200
The bride is coming.

461
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,440
The bride is coming.

462
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,200
The bride is coming.

463
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,070
The bride is coming.

464
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,020
The bride is coming.

465
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,230
Groom,

466
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,030
Mr. He Suye,

467
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,100
please calm down.

468
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,910
We know you're anxious,

469
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,860
but don't be anxious.

470
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,030
I want to ask you something.

471
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,200
Do you want to see how beautiful

472
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,260
your bride is?

473
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,250
I do.

474
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,950
Alright,

475
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,970
then let me take a look for you first.

476
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,430
She's truly beautiful.

477
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,580
Absolutely stunning.

478
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,310
I know you must be feeling overwhelmed.

479
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,600
You must have a lot to say to her.

480
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,450
Then...

481
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,380
Let me give you one more piece of advice.

482
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,340
If

483
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,960
what you say isn't satisfactory enough,

484
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,360
not sincere enough,

485
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,730
or not genuine enough,

486
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,510
she'll just stand there,

487
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,620
or

488
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,860
take a taxi home.

489
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,380
So,

490
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,900
are you ready?

491
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,930
The microphone is yours.

492
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,230
I have...

493
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,980
Dreamed countless times

494
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,500
of you in a wedding dress,

495
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,950
holding a bouquet,

496
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,600
walking towards me step by step.

497
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,720
And today,

498
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,360
my dream

499
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,680
has finally come true.

500
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,780
In our days together,

501
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,870
we've walked many, many streets together.

502
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,480
Together,

503
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
we've passed through rainy forests

504
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,020
and we've also seen

505
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,750
the sea of flowers on the mountains.

506
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,540
You told me

507
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,020
that in the days to come,

508
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,670
we have to see

509
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,470
even more

510
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
beautiful sceneries together.

511
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,680
But in my heart,

512
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,340
you

513
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,400
are the most beautiful scenery

514
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,240
in this world.

515
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Great!

516
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,500
Xifan,

517
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,400
falling in love with you

518
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,590
is the luckiest thing I've ever done.

519
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,940
Loving you

520
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,650
is the best thing

521
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
I've ever done.

522
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,890
He Suye,

523
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,840
me too.

524
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:34,310
Great!

525
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,500
♫It became brighter because of you♫

526
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,560
♫The world suddenly became so cute♫

527
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:17,300

We met at a not-so-good time.

542
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,800
At that time,

543
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,990
I never even thought

544
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,360
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

545
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,720

♫Life is finally complete♫

547
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,070
You made my gray life

suddenly be full of color.

549
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:34,500
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

550
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,010

♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

556
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,060
Back then,

557
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,290
I was lost and helpless,

558
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,510
letting myself slowly fall into an abyss.

559
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,210
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

560
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,530
It was you who grabbed my hand

561
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,950
and never let go,

562
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,870
letting me struggle back to the surface

563
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,180
and be able to breathe again.

564
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,560
It was like waking up from a nightmare

565
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:25,590
♫If missing someone is the stars hanging by the horizon♫

566
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,780
and seeing

567
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,390
that golden sunlight of redemption in the sky.

568
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:33,970
♫I'll remember the scenery with you every time the stars dazzle♫

569
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:39,170
♫Keep flying along our memories♫

570
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:48,320
♫When the snow stops, time will prove everything♫

571
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,100
From now on,

572
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,580
let me love you as I love myself,

573
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,480
and love myself as I love you.

574
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,060
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

575
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:58,320
♫Life is finally complete♫

576
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,030
Loving you

577
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,390
is the best thing

578
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,160
I've ever done.

579
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,860
[Hope everyone with a good heart can find a long-lasting love in the gaps of life.]

580
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:15,510
[it's okay. Learn to love yourself first, more than anyone else in the world.]
[If you can't find that person yet, or you've lost the courage to search,]

581
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:26,570
[And someone will appear in the light shining through the crack.]

582
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:36,280
[The End]
