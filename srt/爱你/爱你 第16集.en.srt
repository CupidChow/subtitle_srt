3
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,680
Did you gain weight during the New Year?

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,350
Happy New Year.

5
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,430
Happy New Year.

6
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,560
Mr. Lin, you're a bit early.

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Happy New Year.

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
I gained 3.65 kg.

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,400
That's so precise.

10
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,850
Thank you.

11
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,160
Have some candy, have some candy.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,630
Happy New Year.

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,760
Have some candy, come have some candy.

14
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,560
You're in your thirties.

15
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
Drinking so much bubble tea, you'll get fat.

16
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
It's none of your business if I get fat or not.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,310
What's going on between you two?

18
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,079
What are you arguing about?

19
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,190
It's nothing. I don't want to talk to him.

20
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,470
I don't want to talk to you either.

21
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,200
Come on, drink some bubble tea.

22
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,310
Stop drinking.

23
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,560
Why can't I drink? I'll drink if I want to.

24
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Just let him drink.

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,590
It's my treat this time.

26
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,430
Let him drink.

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
Fine, you drink. I'm leaving.

28
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Wait a moment.

29
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,370
This is a gift specially from my parents for you.

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,030
Just take it.

31
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,360
Don't be angry anymore.

32
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,320
Is this for me?

33
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
Yes, it's yours.

34
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:45,510
You, go after her. Stop drinking.

35
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,230
Oh, stop drinking.

36
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,079
Xu Xiangya.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,590
Wait a moment.

38
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,590
Let me talk to you.

39
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,630
Xifan.

40
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,630
Do you know

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,230
what's going on with Xiangya and Mr. Lin today?

42
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,390
They're at odds with each other.

43
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,690
Leave them alone.

44
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,550
They're always like this.

45
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
That's true.

46
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
What's wrong?

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,430
The bus is here.

48
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,490
What's the matter?

49
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,660
Good news.

50
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,360
Good news? What's going on?

51
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,320
Tell me about it.

52
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,490
The weather is so nice today, look.

53
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright then.

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,950
You'll still graduate with your master's degree under my supervision.

55
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,750
After advancing to your doctoral studies, you can transfer to the gynecology department.

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,600
This afternoon,

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,830
I'll contact Director Zhao from the gynecology department.

58
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,630
I'll ask him to be your doctoral supervisor.

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,890
Thank you, Professor.

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,180
That's quite good.

61
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,160
It's a good thing to find your own ideas and goals before

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,580
starting your doctoral studies.

63
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
If there's nothing else,

64
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,430
Iâ€™ll leave now.

65
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,240
I have a meeting at the Third Hospital this afternoon.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay.

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,750
Then I'll see you out.

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,390
No need.

69
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,890
You should prepare for your rounds.

70
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
I'll be going then.

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
Goodbye, Professor.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,160
Goodbye.

73
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,040
Senior He.

74
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,090
Have you made up your mind?

75
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,210
You're transferring to the gynecology department?

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
I've been thinking about it for a while.

77
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
I think what you said makes sense.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,270
I don't want to

79
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,330
have my achievements and efforts discredited one day.

80
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,690
Although this might not necessarily happen,

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,830
I need to consider my own interests.

82
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,510
Moreover,

83
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,440
I feel that oncology doesn't really suit me.

84
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,880
The atmosphere is too depressing.

85
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,360
So,

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,620
I'll take this opportunity to transfer to gynecology.

87
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,040
During my doctoral studies,

88
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,370
I want to research women's health issues.

89
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,360
This direction suits you well.

90
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,430
I think so too.

91
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright, hurry back to school.

92
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,030
Get some rest while you can.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,290
The internship in gynecology will be even more demanding.

94
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,780
Good luck, Senior He.

95
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,470
Thank you for mentoring me during my internship these past two years.

96
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,850
It's part of my job.

97
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,070
What's the deal with this picture?

98
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,970
You two, explain this to me right now.

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,230
Confess immediately.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,120
Mom, what's wrong?

101
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,680
I'll land after 10 p.m.

102
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,880
It'll be midnight by the time I get home.

103
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,310
Why such a rush?

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,070
Let's talk about it after the New Year.

105
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,270
Don't we have to do a thorough cleaning tomorrow

106
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,070
and prepare for the New Year's Eve dinner and such?

107
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
Alright, alright, I'm at the airport now.

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,430
I've got to go now.

109
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,040
Bye-bye.

110
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,510
She's calling you back for a blind date, huh?

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,850
Why pretend to be so reluctant?

112
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,870
Wasn't it already arranged for you to go back for a blind date?

113
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,929
I hope your blind date is successful.

114
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,080
What?

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,690
We've known each other for almost 10 years, right?

116
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,590
You should know what kind of person I am by now.

117
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,550
I like you.

118
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,990
Do you want to be together with me?

119
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,970
We can't be just friends anymore anyway.

120
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,030
Even if we break up in the future,

121
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,030
the worst outcome would just be

122
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,360
not being able to be friends, right?

123
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
I'll quit and go back to my hometown then.

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,730
I won't be in your way at all.

125
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,000
So, what do you say?

126
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,150
Is this result okay?

127
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,390
Oh, so it started before the New Year?

128
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,010
And no one told me?

129
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,750
I thought you two were really angry with each other.

130
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,080
We didn't want other colleagues to know.

131
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,390
After all, we work in the same place.

132
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,000
We didn't say anything during the New Year

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,840
because it was a bit awkward.

134
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,510
We were looking for a chance to tell you.

135
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,600
We were planning to tell you

136
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,390
after the morning meeting.

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,630
But the way you were fooled by us

138
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,720
was really funny.

139
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,480
Fine.

140
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,410
So you two teamed up to play me, huh?

141
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,390
By the way,

142
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,620
your acting is really bad.

143
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,600
It could only fool her.

144
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,790
Alright, alright, my acting is bad.

145
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,920
Your acting is good.

146
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,510
The day she gave the gift,

147
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,770
you didn't even finish your lines

148
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,490
before you walked away,

149
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,770
leaving me here alone.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,630
Enough.

151
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,710
So, are you two

152
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,570
planning to keep this a secret forever?

153
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,380
No, we won't.

154
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,310
I'm planning to quit with you when the time comes.

155
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,270
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

156
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,080
Working in hotel food service,

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
besides our main duties,

158
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,350
there are too many things to worry about.

159
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,570
When researching new dishes,

160
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,230
I feel particularly limited.

161
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,840
So,

162
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,270
I might as well quit with you

163
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,710
and find a new environment.

164
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,830
It also avoids office romance, right?

165
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,680
Then I'll stay here.

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
After you graduate and come back,

167
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,690
if you want to come back to work,

168
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,750
we can still be colleagues.

169
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,910
Okay.

170
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,210
Are you not angry anymore?

171
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,330
Not anymore.

172
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,480
That's good.

173
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,840
What's going on with you two?

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,240
Let go of each other's hand. What are you doing?

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,500
But seriously though,

176
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,120
I've come to realize

177
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,620
that when two people have feelings for each other but insist on being just friends,

178
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,310
it's bound to come to an end.

179
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,840
So why not just start dating?

180
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,510
The worst outcome is breaking up,

181
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,300
and not even being able to be friends.

182
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
At least there won't be any regrets.

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
So, you and Dr. He...

184
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,090
Stop.

185
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,180
Why are you suddenly talking about me?

186
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,650
[Oncology]

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,970
Where's today's homework?

188
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,520
You seem to look forward to my dad's daily assignments, huh?

189
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,720
My dad is in charge of cooking at home,

190
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,490
but he didn't cook today,

191
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,870
so there's no homework.

192
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay.

193
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,070
I'm still looking forward to seeing you.

194
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,170
Dr. He, a patient has arrived.

195
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,970
Come in.

196
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,310
-Letâ€™s go for dinner.
-Letâ€™s go.

197
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,790
Xifan, let's go.

198
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,440
Maybe I should go back first.

199
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,510
Where are you going back to?

200
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,080
Your parents

201
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
went hiking today, didn't they?

202
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,580
You won't have anything to eat if you go home.

203
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,750
That's right.

204
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,010
Well,

205
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,550
let's go.

206
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,630
Everything else is fine.

207
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,390
Just remember,

208
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,520
don't drink alcohol after taking the medication.

209
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:19,870
Okay.

210
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,510
Thank you, Dr. He.

211
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:20,870
You're welcome.

212
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,630
It's my duty.

213
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,870
Please be careful as the vehicle enters the station.

214
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay, okay, alright.

215
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,910
Okay, please have a seat.

216
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,370
It'll be ready in a moment.

217
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh my!

218
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,050
He Suye.

219
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,600
Why are you so late?

220
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,840
Sit down.

221
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,150
I just saw your WeChat message.

222
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,330
You're lying.

223
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,650
I bought so much alcohol for you.

224
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,710
I wanted to drink it with you.

225
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,690
And you only show up now.

226
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,620
You've had too much to drink.

227
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
You fickle woman.

228
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,220
Me?

229
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:07,790
Why?

230
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,349
You are fickle.

231
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,640
Fine.

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,920
Then tell me how I'm fickle.

233
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,160
You were the one who hooked me first.

234
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,870
You caught me and then let me go.

235
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,880
I...

236
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,100
I gave you red beans.

237
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,060
Did you eat them?

238
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,430
Did you come for your follow-up visit?

239
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,920
What kind of person does that?

240
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,080
What kind of fish,

241
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,190
spits red beans back at the person who caught it?

242
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,440
Look at me.

243
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,890
Just like this.

244
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,550
Today, I...

245
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,240
went to dinner with Senior Lin and the others.

246
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,470
so I haven't had a chance to eat the red beans yet,

247
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,120
and I haven't had time for the follow-up visit either.

248
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,990
Besides,

249
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,990
how did I hook you?

250
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,200
You did.

251
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,840
No, I didn't.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,680
You hooked me right there.

253
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,120
He Suye, thank you for liking me.

254
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Youâ€™re drunk. Iâ€™ll take you back.

255
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,530
I'm not leaving.

256
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,400
-Letâ€™s go.
-No.

257
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,150
He Suye.

258
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,870
I remember someone told me,

259
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,630
drinking and then being in the wind in this weather can cause a cold.

260
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,550
What, were you lying to me before?

261
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,680
Take me home, please.

262
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,850
Since you hooked me first,

263
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,730
you'll have to be responsible for me.

264
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,420
You can't just abandon me.

265
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,960
Alright.

266
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,590
I won't abandon you.

267
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,350
I'll take you home.

268
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,920
Come on, lift your arms.

269
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,510
You're so heavy.

270
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,790
How can you be such a lightweight and still love to drink?

271
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,940
It's the opposite way.

272
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,340
This way goes to my house.

273
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,840
And garbage all over the place.

274
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,050
I'll come back to clean it up later.

275
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,510
He Suye.

276
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,640
Put me down, put me down.

277
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,610
Password, password.

278
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,740
Enter the password.

279
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,390
You, don't look.

280
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,600
Can you wash up by yourself?

281
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,920
Then I...

282
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,510
No problem.

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,570
I'm leaving, okay?

284
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,070
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

285
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,660
Xifan.

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,160
Good night.

287
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,690
Good night.

288
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,830
Fickle woman.

289
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,430
You were the one who hooked me first.

290
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,310
How come you caught me

291
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,970
and then let me go?

292
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,510
I don't think this counts as hooking him.

293
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,010
Dinner's ready.

294
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,270
Coming.

295
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,100
Where are the soup bowls?

296
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,480
I forgot them.

297
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,760
I'll get them.

298
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,760
Mr. Shen has created a new dish again.

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,970
The last dish in the medicated diet menu.

300
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,510
Red bean and crucian carp soup.

301
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,170
Alright.

302
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,810
Serve the soup.

303
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,570
Oh, okay.

304
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,400
What kind of person does that?

305
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,680
What kind of fish,

306
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,660
spits red beans back at the person who caught it?

307
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,660
Look at me.

308
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,890
Just like this.

309
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,030
You need to flip this fish over.

310
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,850
Only if you flip it over

311
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,810
can you see the red beans in the soup, you know?

312
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
Like this.

313
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
You've scattered it.

314
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,040
Hey, hurry and serve the soup.

315
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,070
The first bowl

316
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,220
goes to Ms. Shen first.

317
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,040
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

318
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,380
Ms. Liu.

319
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,280
Your soup looks kind of scary.

320
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Can it taste good?

321
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,310
This soup

322
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,840
nourishes the spleen and boosts energy.

323
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,070
It's especially good for women.

324
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,400
It tastes really good.

325
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,710
It's alright.

326
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,310
It even cures constipation.

327
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,220
Then you'd better drink more.

328
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,280
â™«A light scentâ™«

329

332
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,240

â™«The whispers that are sometimes far, sometimes nearâ™«

336
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Red bean.

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,950
â™«Exchanging our hidden secretsâ™«

338
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,640
Fish soup.

339
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,590
You did it on purpose.

340
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,890

Shen Xifan.

510
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

511
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,110
You don't care about me at all.

512
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,770
You only care about yourself.

513
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,370
You're too selfish.

I just love you too much.

515
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,410
That's why I didn't realize you've always been this selfish.

Xifan,

517
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,840
I've been thinking for a long time.

518
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,950
We should break up.

519
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,170
Xifan,

520
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,470
let's get back together.

521
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,340
Get back together?

522
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,510
I was really too busy last year.

523
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,920
I had to apply for patents

524
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
for the robot the company developed,

525
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,000
go public, and compete for awards.

526
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,110
I also had to deal with Zhongyu's acquisition

527
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,010
and handle my father.

528
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,270
During that time, I was really stretched thin, I didn't...

529
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,150
After I finished all that and came to my senses,

530
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,410
I really regretted it.

531
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,510
I shouldn't have lost my temper at you.

532
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,510
I shouldn't have argued with you.

533
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,800
We didn't just argue.

534
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
We broke up, okay?

535
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,470
Our seven years of love,

536
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,900
how could we just break up like this?

537
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:48,960
Xifan, listen to me.

538
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,920
Don't touch me.

539
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,480
Go away.

540
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740

We're all here.

542
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,490
What did he tell you?

543
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,910
He's not trying to get back together with you, is he?

544
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,980
He came to see me today.

545
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,800
He said

546
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,070
he was too busy with work before,

547
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,440
so he neglected me.

548
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,830
He said he really regrets it now.

549
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,990
Tell me,

550
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,510
what am I

551
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,740
to him after all?

552
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,400
I actually thought of so many things before,

553
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,360
things I wanted to say to scold him.

554
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,740
I thought about it day and night.

555
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,880
But when he stood in front of me,

556
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,810
I couldn't remember a single word.

557
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,520
Why couldn't I remember anything?

558
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,520
It's okay, it's okay.
