00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,240
Hello.

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,460
May I know if Dr. He Suye is here?

6
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,520
Who are you?

7
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,150
What are you looking him for?

8
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm his friend.

9
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,880
I have something to give him.

10
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,710
He's in Room 0405.

11
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,660
It's right over there.

12
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,870
Please wait at the door for a moment.

13
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,190
The patients are resting.

14
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,150
Okay, thank you.

15
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,590
Who is it?

16
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,840
Someone's looking for Dr. He.

17
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
I don't recognize her.

18
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
Could she be a patient's family member?

19
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,700
I haven't seen her before.

20
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,800
-Dr. He.
-Dad!

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,870
Dad!

22
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
Why are you running so fast?

23
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,560
Where did you go to play?

24
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,820
I went to the toy store.

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Come with me on my house calls this afternoon, okay?

26
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Come on, let's wash our hands first.

27
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,710
Dad...

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Dad?

29
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,040
Go.

30
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,690
Go back to the ward first.

31
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,710
Dr. He, you left your contract behind.

32
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,280
I was in a rush earlier.

34
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,220
Did you take the contract with you?

35
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,130
I'm here by the nurses' station.

36
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,090
Come and get it.

37
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,360
Thank you for making a special trip.

38
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Actually,

39
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,630
you could have waited until I got back tonight

40
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,630
to get it from you.

41
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,920
It's okay.

42
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,630
It's not trouble at all.

43
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm just glad you got it.

44
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,220
Thank you.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,900
If there's nothing else, I'll head back to work.

46
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,900
Bye-bye.

47
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,480
Dr. He, is there something going on?

48
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,610
There's nothing going on.

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,920
You said to get it when you go back tonight.

50
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,650
How is this "nothing going on"?

51
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,240
Here you go.

52
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,670
How's it going?

53
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,920
There are still 35 patients to see.

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,050
Alright, good work.

55
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,800
Senior He.

56
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,270
A girl came looking for you just now.

57
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,540
I saw her.

58
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,370
So who is she?

59
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,960
A friend of mine.

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,159
By the way,

61
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,640
are you guys free on Sunday?

62
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,960
Would you be interested in doing a project with me at a hotel?

63
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,420
We'll design a TCM therapy package for them.

64
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,980
There'll be extra pay.

65
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,890
We just need to stay in the hotel, right?

66
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,650
What a great opportunity!

67
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,409
I want to go!

68
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,520
Then I'll go too.

69
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,600
But the place is far away in the suburbs.

70
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,310
So you two need to come to my place on the weekend,

71
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,390
and I'll drive you there.

72
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,800
Okay.

73
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,870
Which hotel is it?

74
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,930
Gunan Huating.

75
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,520
What's wrong?

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,560
I suddenly remembered I might have something to do on Sunday.

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,510
I can't make it.

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,480
You two figure it out yourselves.

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,770
You just said you'll be free on Sunday

81
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,500
to accompany me to the library.

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Did I say that?

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,040
I've finalised the contract.

84
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,830
He can start working here on Sunday.

85
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,310
He'll also bring a few graduate students with him

86
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,170
to work on this project together.

87
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,760
Okay.

88
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,800
Thanks for making the trip.

89
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:35,970
Senior Lin,

90
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,940
in our budget,

91
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,630
is there any allowance for hospitality expenses?

92
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,890
Why? Does Dr. He need to be reimbursed for transportation?

93
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,159
Not really.

94
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,240
I just want to give him a welcome gift.

95
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,070
A welcome gift?

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,409
That's fine.

97
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,590
What kind of welcome gift do you want to give him?

98
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Children's toys.

99
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,440
Dr. He plays with children's toys?

100
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,090
Dr. He's son plays.

101
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,210
When did you find out he has a child?

102
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,010
I saw a little boy at the hospital today

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,500
following him around and calling him "Dad."

104
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,500
You two have known each other for months

105
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,280
and he has never mentioned it to you?

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,410
Could it be that he's already married?

107
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,800
But I don't see him wearing a ring.

108
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,510
So he's divorced.

109
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,280
Indeed, all the handsome guys these days get married young.

110
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,000
Xiangya.

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,190
Do you think

112
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,950
little boys would prefer

113
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,070
these Transformers toys,

114
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,040
or remote-controlled car models?

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,680
How would I know?

116
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,190
Oh, I just remembered.

117
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,750
The other day when I taught him how to fold towel animals,

118
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,630
I mentioned kids must really love them,

119
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,430
and he seemed super interested.

120
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,720
That's it.

121
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,390
How many single men nowadays

122
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,870
actually like children?

123
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,720
He must have a child of his own.

124
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,380
Are you off work?

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,740
Come and have some medicinal food.

126
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,200
I've made a soup with angelica, astragalus, and crucian carp.

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,120
He texted me.

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,630
He even invited you to his house for dinner.

129
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,130
This cunning old man

130
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,450
obviously wants you to be his son's stepmother.

131
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,850
Quickly turn him down.

132
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,190
I've already eaten. I appreciate the gesture.

133
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,640
Thank you.

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,090
You're being too polite.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,780
You should be more assertive.

136
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,750
No.

137
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,200
We still have to work together on Sunday.

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,080
What happens if everyone feels awkward then?

139
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
Alright, alright.

140
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,970
Just pick one at random then.

141
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,410
No need to waste time on this kind of thing.

142
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
You've eaten so early?

143
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,930
Grandpa, what are you doing?

144
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
I'm about to have my meal.

145
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,570
Making phone calls while eating is bad for your spleen and stomach.

146
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,170
I have something to tell you.

147
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,790
Call me back after I finish eating.

148
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,550
Wait.

149
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
This Sunday,

150
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
I won't be coming over to your place.

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,250
What are you going to do?

152
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,710
I took on a consulting job.

153
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm working with the hotel Shen Xifan works for.

154
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,780
I plan to take them to visit the herbal garden.

155
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,920
Their hotel is quite close to the herbal garden.

156
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,630
Is that okay?

157
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,620
Sure, that's fine.

158
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,870
It's our own garden after all.

159
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,130
Just let the housekeeper know tomorrow.

160
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,820
Wait.

161
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,440
Shen Xifan?

162
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,710
Yes, yes.

163
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,420
Is that the young Miss Shen?

164
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,940
Is it purely work-related?

165
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,510
Or...

166
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm already so busy with work at the hospital.

167
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,650
Why would I take on a purely work-related job?

168
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,910
But you told me last time

169
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,440
that young Miss Shen was about to get married.

170
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,710
I was mistaken about that.

171
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,230
So you've figured it out this time?

172
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,140
What do you mean by "figured it out"?

173
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,690
Are you referring to work or to her?

174
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,010
Don't play dumb.

175
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm talking about her, Shen Xifan.

176
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,290
Yes, I've figured it out.

177
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,220
Well, she's a smart

178
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,330
and interesting girl.

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
And she's quite childlike as well.

180
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,510
Childlike?

181
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,940
In your 50 years of medical practice,

182
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,930
have you ever met a patient who haggled with you

183
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,430
and even altered your prescription?

184
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,640
Who would dare?

185
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,270
She did.

186
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,950
Alright then.

187
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,290
You handle it as you see fit.

188
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,840
You've been presumptuous for so long,

189
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
it's time to make an effort.

190
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
Girls need to be pursued.

191
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,730
Okay, got it.

192
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,510
That's all then. Bye-bye.

193
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,930
What's with that expression?

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,870
Let me tell you,

195
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,480
all men are the same.

196
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,430
No matter how nice they seem on the surface,

197
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,970
they're always singing a different tune inside.

198
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,630
Only people like me...

199
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
Only people like you

200
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,680
who've been sheltered all their lives

201
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,870
would fall for their tricks.

202
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,880
Look at Lin Yishen, is he any good?

203
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,550
He's always smiling,

204
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,670
treating girls extra gently

205
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,070
and being overly attentive.

206
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,670
And then there's your ex-boyfriend, Yan Heng.

207
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,910
He was so cold and abusive before the breakup,

208
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,410
making it seem like it was all your fault.

209
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,450
In reality, he wanted to break up long ago.

210
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,250
He just couldn't find an excuse.

211
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,270
And here you are, making excuses for him,

212
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,550
and trying to find reasons within yourself.

213
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,340
You...

214
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,440
Enough, enough, enough.

215
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,910
Stop talking about Yan Heng.

216
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,030
The more you talk, the sadder I feel.

217
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,790
Stop.

218
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,370
Alright, I'll get straight to the point.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,320
If a woman wants to live well,

220
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,200
she absolutely cannot waste energy on self-consuming.

221
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,110
All the faults lie with others.

222
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,680
Hello, welcome.

223
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,230
Hello, where are they?

224
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,630
There.

225
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,080
Thanks.

226
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,350
Xifan.

227
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,280
Xifan.

228
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,200
Xifan.

229
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,080
Xifan.

230
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,960
How much did you drink?

232
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,870
Pack up your things.

233
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,060
I'll send you home.

234
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,770
How much did you drink?

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,590
Xiangya, Xiangya.

236
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,080
Xu Xiangya.

237
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,920
Get up, let's go.

238
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,510
Pack up, I'll send you home.

239
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,750
Why is it you?

240
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,110
What do you mean "why is it me"?

241
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,590
You called me to come here.

242
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,750
Get up, pack your things, I'll send you home.

243
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,280
Really?

244
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,230
Hurry up.

245
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,110
Trash.

246
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,920
Trash who doesn't even know he's trash.

247
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,470
The trash guy they've been cursing all this time,

248
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,470
-it's him?
-How much did you drink?

249
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:43,870
Get up quickly.

250
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,400
Let's go.

251
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,960
Let me tell you,

252
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,160
you'd better apologize to me when you're sober tomorrow.

253
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,410
Xifan.

254
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,160
Don't move yet.

255
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,870
I'll send you all back together.

256
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,400
No need, I've called a car.

257
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,130
You can just send Xiangya home.

258
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,960
Get up, get up.

259
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,110
Don't call a car.

260
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,010
I'll send you home.

261
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,210
I've already called.

262
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,210
I...

263
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,350
Xifan,

264
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
your things!

265
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,520
I'm home.

266
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,560
Shen Xifan?

267
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,650
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

268
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,340
What are you doing?

269
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,450
So you didn't come for dinner because you went drinking.

270
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,030
Come on, let's get you home.

271
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,590
Don't worry about me.

272
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,480
You'll catch a cold if you stay out here in the wind.

273
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,190
What?

274
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,740
Trash.

275
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,320
I...

276
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,050
Not replying to WeChat messages

277
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,020
is trash.

278
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,750
Treating others to meals is also trash.

279
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,200
Look, there's trash everywhere.

280
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

281
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,870
I'm trash, I'm trash.

282
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,510
I'll send you home.

283
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,750
You're not allowed to send me home.

284
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,400
What are you doing?

285
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm not even drunk.

286
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,350
How is this not drunk?

287
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,040
You're not sober.

288
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,110
I'm not drunk.

289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,980
Your behavior when drunk.

290
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,950
Don't you dare follow me.

291
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,839
I'm watching you.

292
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,230
Mr. Shen, Ms. Liu,

293
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,200
there's a man following me.

294
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,360
The one with the bowl haircut.

295
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,690
Go check it out quickly.

296
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,790
-Are you alright?
-What a rogue!

297
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,310
There are so many people in this neighbourhood.

298
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,710
Aren't you too bold?

299
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,180
If you don't leave, I'm calling the police.

300
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,620
Get away right now.

301
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,530
He was following you?

302
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,000
Where did you go drinking?

303
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,200
She went drinking.

304
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,160
What's going on? Are you okay?

305
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,050
I'm fine.

306
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,510
Let's go, let's go.

307
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,600
Let's go home too.

308
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,880
Don't come back so late.

309
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,340
Be careful of your safety.

310
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,880
You're quite fierce when you're drunk.

311
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,610
Little drunkard.

312
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,470
My head hurts.

313
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,770
I'm never drinking again.

314
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,570
I've taken the toys for you, okay?

315
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,480
[Come for your follow-up visit anytime. No need to register.]
[Are you awake? Remember to come for your follow-up visit.]
[Go have some fruits when you wake up. Drinking more honey water helps with the hangover.]

316
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,300
"Come for your follow-up visit anytime. No need to register."

317
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,120
Trash.

318
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,920
Not replying to WeChat messages is trash.

319
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,600
Treating others to meals is also trash.

320
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,030
Okay.

321
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,470
-One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
-I’m trash. I’m trash.

322
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:25,960
I'll send you home.

323
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,890
You're not allowed to send me home.

324
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,370
It's over.

325
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,700
I'm the real trash.

326
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,330
You're up?

327
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,620
Good morning.

328
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,860
Morning.

329
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Throwing it away when it's perfectly fine is such a waste.

330
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,080
I got a stiff neck from sleeping on the couch.

331
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,410
Why did you scold me last night?

332
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Did I scold you?

333
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,100
Yes, you did.

334
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,980
You called me trash who doesn't know they're trash.

335
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,710
I might have...

336
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,680
mistaken you for someone else when I was drunk.

337
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,510
I've noticed lately

338
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,070
you've been acting passive-aggressive towards me.

339
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,130
What did I do to you?

340
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,090
Is it because of the Goddess Group incident?

341
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:25,850
No.

342
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,200
Then why?

343
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,950
I just don't like you.

344
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,920
Hold on.

345
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,290
You must have a reason for not liking me, right?

346
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,550
Tell me what you don't like about me then.

347
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,550
I'll change. I'll apologize to you.

348
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,900
Are you going back to your hometown soon?

349
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,680
How did you know?

350
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,830
I overheard you talking on the phone with your mom.

351
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,880
So you heard.

352
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,540
Why didn't you ask me about it?

353
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,160
Why should I ask you?

354
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,230
You weren't planning to tell me anyway.

355
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,690
Since you didn't say anything, I'll just pretend I don't know.

356
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm done eating. I'm going now.

357
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,530
Wait, let's clear things up before you go.

358
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,640
Someone's treating me to a big meal later.

359
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,210
I need to get dressed up.

360
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,620
Leave on your own when you're done eating.

361
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,070
Do you need it heated up?

362
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,840
Xiangya.

363
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,680
Tomorrow, you

364
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,740
should at least treat me to two meals.

365
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,360
Still not awake yet, huh?

366
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,990
What time are we going to the hotel tomorrow?

367
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,790
Do you need me to drive you there?

368
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,470
10 in the morning. I can take the bus there.

369
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,360
Thank you.

370
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,200
Okay.

371
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,070
We're here.

372
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,230
Your Highness, please exit the car.

373
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,290
Thank you, Prince.

374

Hello, Dr. He.

Hello.

376
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,750
I'm the manager of the Marketing Department at our hotel,

377
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,470
Lin Yishen.

378
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm also the person in charge of this project.

379
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,880
Nice to meet you.

380
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,810
Nice to meet you.

381
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,850
Let me intro–

382
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
Let me introduce you.

383
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,890
This is Xu Xiangya, the manager of our Food & Beverage Department.

384
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,400
I don't need to introduce Manager Shen in detail, do I?

385
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
No need, we know each other well.

386
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,600
These are my two postgraduate students.

387
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,660
They're taking this chance to learn.

388
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,790
This is Li Jie.

389
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,300
You two have met before, right?

390
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,760
We've met in the hospital lobby.

391
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,510
I remember.

392
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

393
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,840
This is my junior, Fang Kexin.

394
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,940
Hello.

395
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,880
You were the one who gave me directions at the hospital, right?

396
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Yes.

397
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,850
-Hello.
-Hello.

398
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,090
Welcome, please come in.

399
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,130
Manager Shen, I-

400
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,500
Mo.

401
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,590
Please park the car for Dr. He.

402
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,300
Okay.

403
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,370
Hello, sir.

404
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,550
You just need to pass me the car keys.

405
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,310
Please give them to me.

406
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,910
Thank you.

407
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,310
He is indeed quite handsome.

408
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,910
Unfortunately, he's not suitable.

409
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,280
Thank you all for taking the time to come here today.

410
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:48,920
Here.

411
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,310
This is a small token of our appreciation.

412
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,360
Thank you.

413
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,550
Thank you.

414
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,480
You're welcome.

415
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,120
Thank you.

416
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Please, this way.

417
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,780
[Robot model]

418
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,310
If the elderly experience insomnia,

419
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,120
we can improve their sleep conditions

420
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
through massaging their Yintang

421
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,380
and Baihui acupoints.

422
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,160
Massaging these two acupoints

423
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,200
can have a calming and sedative effect.

424
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,460
The massage technique

425
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
is roughly as demonstrated by Fang.

426
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,160
The Baihui acupoint is at the midpoint of the line connecting the ears,

427
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,060
while the Yintang acupoint is at the centre between the eyebrows.

428
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,590
This is a relatively simple

429
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,750
and effective massaging technique.

430
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,510
The hotel staff

431
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,120
can learn it through simple practice

432
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,380
and quickly master it.

433
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,670
Let me try.

434
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,440
Go ahead.

435
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,840
This position.

436
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,820
Then use this hand to support him.

437
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,600
Put your hand here.

438
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,190
Right.

439
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,030
Then use this hand to support him on this side.

440
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,200
In the TCM theory,

441
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,930
insomnia and frequent dreams are often due to emotional distress.

442
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,510
In most cases,

443
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,580
it's considered a heart issue.

444
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,400
Because the heart houses the spirit.

445
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,960
If the heart doesn't house the spirit, the spirit has no place to dwell

446
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,220
and becomes restless,

447
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
hence resulting in sleeplessness.

448
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
I recommend using aromatherapy

449
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,070
or adding some herbs with calming effects

450
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,820
to buckwheat pillows.

451
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,890
Using aromatherapy and buckwheat pillows to treat insomnia

452
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,460
has a gentle and smooth effect

453
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,060
and is more easily accepted.

454
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,130
Not bad, not bad.

455
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,990
These are some basic TCM knowledge.

456
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,450
Do you have any questions?

457
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,720
Did it turn red?

458
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,710
No, no, no.

459
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,440
A little bit.

460
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,120
It's not noticeable.

461
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,680
Alright, that's all for today's content.

462
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,200
I hope it's helpful for everyone.

463
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
It's very helpful.

464
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,670
Thank you, thank you.

465
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,400
Later, we'll organize our staff

466
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,030
to watch the footage we just recorded

467
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,270
to learn these massage techniques and knowledge.

468
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,800
Do we have any other plans for this afternoon?

469
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,200
20 minutes away from the hotel,

470
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,840
there's an herbal plantation base

471
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,360
that collaborates with our school.

472
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,270
Actually, we could go and visit it.

473
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,550
Meanwhile, we can use the readily available herbs from the base

474
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,750
to make some samples.

475
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,270
Alright, let's do that.

476
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,600
So, that's it for this morning.

477

in your car.

489
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,640
This way you won't have to carry it.

490
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,770
No need to be polite.

This chicken is grain-fed by local farmers.

it's especially organic,

and very healthy.

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:48,510
It's our exclusive recipe.

510
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,310
You can't find it anywhere else.

511
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,920
Come on, Dr. He. Grab a bite.

512
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,460
Dr. He,

513
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,320
I heard you're an oncologist from

514
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,780
the the City TCM Hospital?

515
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,370
Yes.

516
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,840
then how come Xifan

517
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,200
went to an oncologist

518
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,310
to treat insomnia?

519
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,300
I do consultations at a clinic near my home on weekends.

520
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,500
She probably just happened to get an appointment with me.

521
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,380
I was just getting an appointment randomly.

522
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,739
Try this, brother.

523
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,630
Okay.

524
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,550
How did you think of

525
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,679
the idea of giving me children's toys?

526
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,030
Since you're a local,

527
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,719
giving you local specialties

528
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,650
doesn't seem appropriate.

529
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,750
Gifting you health supplements instead

530
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,080
might come across as showing off in front of experts.

531
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,219
So I prepared a set of toys for your son

532
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,800
to express my gratitude.

533
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,070
Since when does Senior He have a son?

534
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah.

535
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,190
Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?

536
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,470
Well...

537
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,880
That day when I went to the hospital to find you,

538
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,840
I saw a child about seven or eight years old...

539
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,920
Dad!

540
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,620
Why are you running so fast?

541
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,800
Where did you run off to play?

542
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
Following right behind you,

543
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,390
calling you "Dad."

544
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,110
You must be talking about Zhao Ze.

545
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,860
He's a young patient at our hospital.

546
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,720
He likes to call Senior He that all the time.

547
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,120
But he's not Senior He's son.

548
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,940
Senior He is still single.

549
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,410
I told him not to say that.

550
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,400
A misunderstanding did happen after all.

551
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,230
I didn't know...

552
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,800
As long as you got it.

553
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,660
I'm going back to work.

554
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,370
Trash.

555
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,840
I...

556
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,880
Not replying to WeChat messages is trash.

557
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,800
Treating others to meals is also trash.

558
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,590
Look, there's trash everywhere.

559
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,850
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

560
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,890
I don't need to introduce Manager Shen in detail, do I?

561
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,460
Let's eat.

562
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,190
Try this.

563
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,620
Xifan.

564
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,600
Come on.

565
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:13,240
♫No fear of the night, no matter how long♫

566
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,070
♫Your voice is always gentle♫

567
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,220
♫Knowing you'll wait for me to take that brave step♫

568
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,540
♫Walking toward you♫

569
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,000
♫At the end of my dreams♫

570
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,000
♫Holding on tight, never letting go♫

571
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,430
♫Waiting for you♫

572
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,150
♫To heal every tomorrow for me♫

573
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,900
♫The best time♫

574
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,250
♫There's always something that's special in the past♫

575
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,150
♫We thought about it, but we seem to have forgotten it♫

576
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,150
♫But those moments about you♫

577
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,140
♫I remember everything♫

578
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,090
♫I'm willing to be with you♫

579
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,830
♫I'll go through every time and space with you♫

580
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,620
♫And you are the reason♫

581
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,930
♫I hold on to the moment so dearly♫

582
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:21,390
♫No fear of the night, no matter how long♫

583
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,210
♫Your voice is always gentle♫

584
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,240
♫Knowing you'll wait for me to take that brave step♫

585
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
♫Walking toward you♫

586
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,080
♫At the end of my dreams♫

587
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,930
♫Holding on tight, never letting go♫

588
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,610
♫Waiting for you♫

589
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,920
I was saying, that day after coming back from the hospital,

590
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,920
why did you suddenly go drinking?

591
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,020
So it was because you misunderstood Dr. He.

592
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,620
That's why you went to drink your sorrows away.

593
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,330
You've taken a liking to Dr. He?

594
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,040
What if one day

595
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,040
I suddenly have a son pop up out of nowhere,

596
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
would you also go off drinking?

597
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,360
Of course I would.

598
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,640
What are you thinking?

599
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,470
Alright, alright.

600
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,720
I've noticed you're really stubborn.

601
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,360
But seriously though,

602
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,470
I think Dr. He is a good person.

603
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,550
He has a nice personality too.

604
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,920
And he's serious about his work.

605
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,490
I think you could consider him.

606
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,690
You don't need to have so many concerns.

607
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,700
You're quite good at talking about others.

608
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,030
Xifan.

609
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,090
That student Dr. He is mentoring,

610
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,470
that little boy.

611
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,680
Can you give me his WeChat?

612
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,000
I don't seem to have his WeChat.

613
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,030
I don't believe you.

614
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,190
I don't believe you just met at the hospital.

615
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,280
I just saw him

616
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,920
looking at you like this.

617
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,840
Actually, the two of us

618
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,440
met for the first time on a blind date.

619
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,200
We just had afternoon tea and then parted ways.

620
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,860
So we didn't exchange WeChat.

621
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,720
And I didn't know at the time

622
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,470
that he was Dr. He's student.

623
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,040
Alright then.

624
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,030
I'll add him myself.

625
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,990
Anyway, for work reasons,

626
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,250
adding him on WeChat makes sense, right?

627
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,150
But to be honest,

628
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,960
I think he probably likes He Suye's

629
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,390
other female student.

630
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,250
It doesn't seem appropriate for us to add him on WeChat like this.

631
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,580
Is that his girlfriend?

632
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,740
Probably not.

633
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,310
Then it's settled, isn't it?

634
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,910
I'll add him on WeChat first and then we'll see.

635
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,630
Now you don't like domineering CEOs anymore

636
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,230
and prefer younger guys now?

637
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,150
Young guys are so nice.

638
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,070
They're simple-minded,

639
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,660
and obedient and well-behaved.

640
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,790
Unlike some people.

641
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,890
You know what?

642
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,440
It's so close,

643
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,400
yet we never noticed

644
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
such a nice place nearby.

645
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,720
This herbal garden

646
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,450
is our school's teaching base.

647
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,550
It's usually not open to the public.

648
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,760
Only after freshmen enroll

649
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,720
do we bring them here for a visit

650
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,780
and some learning.

651
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,780
So I said it's a rare opportunity.

652
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,510
You should come and take a look.

653
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,110
I'll take you inside for a tour,

654
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,090
then we'll go back to the research lab to continue working.

655
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,730
Okay.

656
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,950
Okay.

657
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,240
This whole area is platycodon.

658
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,160
It will be very beautiful when it blooms next year.

659
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,550
Platycodon has effects of clearing the lungs, soothing the throat, and expelling phlegm.

660
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,110
It can be used to treat coughs,

661
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,310
excessive phlegm, and other symptoms.

662
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
This patch is newly planted salvia.

663
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,900
Planting them in autumn yields a slightly better harvest.

664
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,400
Is it the same salvia

665
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,430
as in Salvia Miltiorrhiza Dropping Pills?

666
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,070
Yes.

667
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,790
It's growing quite well.

668
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,490
What do you think?

669
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,350
-Not bad, right?
-It’s a nice day.

670
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,240
Indeed.

671
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,630
So beautiful.

672
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:59,990
The lighting here is really nice.

673
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,590
How cute!

674
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,110
Did you plant these flowers yourselves?

675
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,910
They're wild.

676
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,830
Dr. He,

677
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,260
let's take a group photo.

678
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,320
Let's not.

679
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,190
It's okay,

680
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,070
don't be shy.

681
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,030
Come on,

682
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,140
stand here.

683
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,380
Come, stand right here.

684
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,220
Stand here.

685
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:15,670
Come on.

686
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,650
Are we taking the photo or not?

687
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,990
Look at the camera.

688
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,070
Three,

689
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,590
two,

690
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,030
one,

691
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,560
cheese!
