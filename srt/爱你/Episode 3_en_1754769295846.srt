will be here soon.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
All departments must gather the strength

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,700
and take this reception work seriously.

8
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,630
-Got it.
-Got it.

9
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,310
Is the ninth floor okay?

10
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:01,940
Yes, that's fine.

11
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,730
Hello, sir. Please take your room card and ID card.

12
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,730
This way, please.

13
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:06,980
Hello.

14
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,180
Manager Shen,

15
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,090
can you hear me?

16
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:09,900
Yes.

17
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,130
A guest doesn't want to stay in a villa.

18
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,790
Can you arrange another room?

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,500
Take him to the Presidential Suite 1807.

20
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,130
Then ask someone to help with his luggage.

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:19,690
Okay.

22
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,650
Hello.

23
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,220
Based on the X-ray images,

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,090
the patient's lung tissue in this area

25
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,220
has already developed some fibrosis.

26
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,810
At this stage of radiation pneumonitis,

27
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,920
promoting blood circulation and resolving phlegm

28
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,530
are more critical than clearing heat and relieving coughs.

29
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,780
By improving blood circulation and resolving phlegm,

30
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,370
we can enhance the pulmonary blood flow,

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,550
thereby improving lung function

32
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,570
and reducing the risk of infection.

33
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,120
What's the matter?

34
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,670
All right.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,150
Head Nurse.

36
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,230
Perfect timing.

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,220
Please sign this.

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,780
Okay.

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,160
Let's go see a movie tonight.

40
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,530
What movie?

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,190
This one. It's a new tearjerker.

42
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,880
I heard it's really touching.

43
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,020
I'd feel a bit awkward

44
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,740
going alone as a guy.

45
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,800
Let's go together.

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000

officially begin this Wednesday.

51
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm currently

52
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,810

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,500
And this Wednesday, they will...

55
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,390
Everyone, thank you for your hard work yesterday.

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,940
Today, we'll have more VIP members checking in.

57
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,820
Also, there'll be a cocktail party for Zhongyu Tech tomorrow evening.

58
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,620
Oh, right.

59
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,250
Zhongyu Tech's executives will arrive this afternoon.

60
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,110
The Front Office must ensure a seamless reception.

61
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,020
Manager Shen?

62
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,590
Manager Shen.

63
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,260
I'll reconfirm the guest list before noon.

64
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,909
Manager Xu,

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,330
have you checked the food and beverage stock?

66
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,940
Yes, we're fully stocked.

67
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,490
Thank you all for your hard work.

68
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,740
You two already know?

69
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,960
Do you want to have some days off to rest?

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,090
I can cover for you for a couple of days.

71
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,690
No need.

72
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,570
Right,

73
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,980
isn't today Saturday?

74
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,540
Shouldn't you go for your follow-up visit?

75
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,420
Yes.

76
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,050
I forgot.

77
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,690
Then ask for a sick leave now.

78
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,060
Go see your TCM physician and then come back.

79
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,920
I'll keep an eye on things for you.

80
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,740
I'd better not. Didn't General Manager say

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
we can't leave without permission?

82
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,250
I'll finish my work first

83
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,860
and I'll see about it later.

84
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,540
Okay.

[Honganmen Clinic]

86
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,300
This is your prescription.

87
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,130
Thank you, doctor.

88
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,980
See you next week.

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,540
Okay.

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,420
She didn't come again?

91
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,010
A heart's ailment demands

92
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,490
a heart's remedy.

93
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,060
Either clear the blockage,

94
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,450
or

95
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
uproot the cause.

96
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Sun.

97
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,250
Help me check

98
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,810
if there is an appointment made by Shen Xifan.

99
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,740
Shen Xifan?

100
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,010
Just a moment.

101
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,390
No, she doesn't have an appointment today.

102
00:07:59,330 --> 00:07:59,860
Thank you.

103
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,520
No problem.

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,600
Sun.

105
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,180
Give me

106
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,380
Shen Xifan's registered phone number.

107
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,520
Why do you want her phone number?

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,700
She didn't come for her follow-up visit today.

109
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,030
I should check on her

110
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,420
and see if she got held up by something.

111
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,820
She's quite young.

112
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,450
Young people nowadays

113
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,180
lack the patience

114
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,010
for TCM remedies.

115
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,540
It's normal for them to bail without warning.

116
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,100
She made an appointment with me last week.

117
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,060
Really?

118
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,660
Okay.

119
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:32,980
Just a moment.

120
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,299
One...

121
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,840
Here.

122
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,470
You owe me a meal.

123
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,510
I owe you a meal?

124
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,020
This is about being responsible for the patient.

125
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,690
Responsible.

126
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,660
Put on your mask.

127
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,660
Ms. Fang,

128
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,570
we knew you were coming.

129
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,450
We've already placed your favorite aromatherapy in your room.

130
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,590
Your room card will be ready in a moment.

131
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,520
Okay, thank you.

132
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,970
Mr. Yan!

133
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,300
Ms. Fang.

134
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,970
Long time no see.

135
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,900
Long time no see.

136
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,610
Shen.

137
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,140
Please handle Mr. Yan's check-in as well.

138
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,180
Sure, no problem.

139
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,540
Mr. Yan, this is Shen.

140
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,540
She's the manager of this hotel's Front Office Department.

141
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,690
If there's anything you need during your stay,

142
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,020
you can ask her for help.

143
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,570
You came alone today?

144
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,500
Your two sons didn't come with you?

145
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,830
My eldest son...

146
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,910
He is busy

147
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,380
managing some issues at his company's branch.

148
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,540
My younger son, Yan Heng,

149
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,900
is busy with his small robotics company.

150
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,540
He's not qualified, so I didn't let him come.

151
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,690
Robotics, right?

152
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,780
What a coincidence. I have a niece

153
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,420
who pays much attention to the AI industry.

154
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,850
These two kids should meet.

155
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,420
Sure, why not?

156
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,730
Sounds like they'd have a lot to talk about.

157
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,660
Definitely.

158
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,380
You should arrange it.

159
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,060
Should we arrange it?

160
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,690
Set up a meeting.

161
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,140
How about setting up a meeting for them

162
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:09,810
and let's have a meal together?

163
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,610
Okay.

164
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,610
That's great.

165
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,900
I agree.

166
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,440
It's settled then.

167
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:32,730
Hello.

168
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,940
Excuse me,

169
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,610
is this Ms. Shen Xifan?

170
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,180
Yes.

171
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,780
Who am I speaking with?

172
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,730
This is He Suye.

173
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,180
Dr. He.

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,940
Hello.

175
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,810
Are you coming today?

176
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,000
I've been waiting for you.

177
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
Manager Shen.

178
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,590
Please wait a moment.

179
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,850
Please tell the colleagues

180
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,330
from the Food & Beverage Department

181
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,800
to check when Ms. Fang will finish her afternoon tea.

182
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,990
Make sure to prepare hot water

183
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,810
for her bath later.

184
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,260
Okay.

185
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,180
Thank you.

186
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,140
I'm sorry, Dr. He.

187
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,190
I just had something to attend to.

188
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,840
I just want to ask

189
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,170
how you've been lately.

190
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,830
You didn't come for your follow-up visit today.

191
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,570
I've been a bit too busy lately.

192
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,420
So I didn't have time to go today.

193
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,260
Okay.

194
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,420
Then...

195
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,270
will you come next week?

196
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,710
Of course,

197
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,110
I'll be there next week.

198
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:41,680
♫So I wait and wander, but the outcome isn't so bad♫

199
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,320
How have you been feeling lately?

200
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,660
Have your symptoms of trouble sleeping, chest tightness, and anxiety

201
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,720
gotten any better?

202
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:49,140
♫Sparrows gather on the windowsill, sunlight streaming through♫

203
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,810
I've been doing pretty well lately.

204
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,210
At least I'm getting about five hours of sleep now.

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,180
♫Poets keep altering words to record the fast-changing world♫

206
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,810
And falling asleep is much easier than before.

207
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,060
That's good.

208
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,540
No matter how busy work gets, you still need to rest.

210
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,570
If you have time,

211
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,770
try visiting places with lots of trees.

212
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,670
♫It became brighter because of you♫

213
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,090

♫The world suddenly became so cute♫

215
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,900

♫Maybe I'm too slow to understand♫

217
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,490
Places with lots of trees

218
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,610
have plenty of oxygen,

219
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,420
which can help you relax.

220
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,230
♫I can't confess my passionate love to you♫

221
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,390
Does that sound more scientific?

222
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,440
Much more scientific.

223
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,230
♫Love is an admiration for beauty♫

224
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,150
♫I've decided to only love you♫

Have you run out of your medicine?

226
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,900
Do you need me to prescribe more for you?

227
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
♫My foolishness♫

228
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,220
I think I still have a couple of bags left.

But I've been really busy lately,

232
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,660
and I get off work late,

233
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,450
so I might not be able to come for a follow-up visit.

234
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,640
♫Because of you, everything brightens up♫

235
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,460
It's okay.

236
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,110
How about this? I'll use last week's prescription

237
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,870
and have the pharmacy decoct it for you.

238
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,160
You can have your family come pick it up.

239
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
Sure, no problem.

240
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,110
Can I add you on WeChat through this phone number?

241
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,610
I need to send you a photo of the prescription

242
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,750
so your family can show it when picking up the medicine.

243
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,840
Yes.

244
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,330
This number is my WeChat ID.

245
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,660
You can add me directly.

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,950
Okay.

Okay.

279

Wait.

280
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,740
Well... help me pack one more thing separately.

281
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,730
Licorice root, with its sweet flavor and neutral nature,

282
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,250
is renowned for tonifying the spleen, boosting qi, and clearing heat and toxins.

283
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,520
You can steep a few slices in water to drink.

284
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,780
It probably tastes as good as bubble tea.

285
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,850
Thank you.

286
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,450
The doctor told you to steep it in water?

287
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,040
That's quite thoughtful.

288
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,210
Drink this first.

289
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,210
Drink it while it's hot.

290
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,410
Don't let it get cold.

291
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,790
It's not bitter.

292
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,710
What made you think of steeping licorice root?

293
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,690
I happened to see some in the kitchen.

294
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,100
So I made two cups.

295
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:30,730
Not bad.

296
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,540

Did the Shen Xifan you mentioned last time

300

come for her follow-up visit this week?

301
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,250
No.

302
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,180
You only get to see her once a week when she comes for her follow-up visit.

303
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,510
You've missed this one.

304
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,180
Do you think she might stop coming to the clinic for treatment?

She won't. She's busy this week.

307
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:00,130
She'll come for her follow-up visit next week.

308

How do you know that?

310
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,070
I called and asked.

311
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,920
You have her number now?

312
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,910
I got her number from the clinic's registration form.

313
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,050
Didn't you say it's not good to mix personal matters with work?

314
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,600
But you said it's fine to get information

315
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,630
from the registration form, right?

316
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,650
Did you check up on her?

317
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,950
She has a boyfriend.

318
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,900
She has a boyfriend?

319
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,600
Well...

320
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,700
Of course. Such a beautiful and elegant girl

321
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,790
must have many pursuers.

322
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,840
Since that's the case,

323
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,780
you should stop entertaining any thoughts.

324
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,210
As TCM physicians,

325
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,540
we should focus on cultivating our character and maintaining our integrity.

326
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,570
Don't let any messy situations

327
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,120
ruin our reputation.

328
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,190
What else can I say?

329
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,170
Don't worry, I won't do anything reckless.

330
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,550
She has a boyfriend?

331
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,660
What a pity.

How should I put it?

350
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,860
I'm not quite good at drinking.

351
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,580
Once I start, I drink too much.

352
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,710
That's not true. You look quite sober.

353
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,110
It's not appropriate to leave early.

walk me to the parking lot.

357
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Mr. Yan, let me walk you there.

358
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,000
Perfect. You take my assistant to my room

359
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,810

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,730
This way, please.

373
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,210
Okay.

374
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,180
Let's go.

375
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,620
Has Yan Heng...

376
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,020
talked to you about that?

377
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,420
Yes.

378
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,050
That's good.

379
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,050
Uncle,

380
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,290
when will Yan Heng return to China?

381
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,580
He's not abroad.

382
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,440
He's at home.

383
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,790
He's been in Hang City.

384
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,180
Why won't he even meet me once?

385
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,260
We were together for seven years.

386
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,810
Don't I even deserve a proper goodbye?

387
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,330
Am I that annoying?

388
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,140
What did I do wrong?

389
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,500
If you have time,

390
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
try visiting places with lots of trees.

391
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,420
The energy of plants

392
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,110
can soothe your body and mind.

393
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,640
Places with lots of plants have plenty of oxygen,

394
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,300
which can help ease your mood.

395
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,460
Maybe drinking two more bags will help me fall asleep.

396
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,340
It's okay. As long as I can fall asleep, it'll be okay.

397
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,170
It'll be fine once I'm asleep.

398
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,780
[The closing day of the JIC Summit in Hang City]

399
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,650
Yan Heng hasn't come, right?

400
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:37,820
No.

401
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,470
The summit's over and he still hasn't shown up.

402
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,070
He's definitely not coming.

403
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,100
From what I know about men like him,

404
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,250
he doesn't have the guts to come.

405
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,250
If he dares to come, I'll...

406
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:48,940
Alright.

407
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Keep it down.

408
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,900
There are guests around.

409
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,140
You said you need an invoice, right?

410
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,900
Yes.

411
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,340
I'll send it to you right away.

412
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,010
Okay.

413
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:29,610
♫The moment I see you, all my worries turn transparent♫

414
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:37,710
♫In the silence, the sound of my heartbeat grows clearer♫

415
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,130
♫The entire world reflects in your eyes♫

416
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:51,780
♫Make a wish, can the snow fall slowly?♫

417
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,420
I wonder how long this summit will last.

418
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,890
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

419
00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:02,030
♫Life is finally complete♫

420
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,030
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

421
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,530
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

422
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,010
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

423
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,770
♫But I never said those words♫

424
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,320
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

425
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,240
♫When will love bloom into a flower?♫

426
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,960
♫You wander the world, forgetting to reply♫

427
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,730
♫When you turn around, I'll be right there♫

428
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,970
Hello, Xiangya.

429
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,420
Hello, what are you doing?

430
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,210
I'm tidying up the room.

431
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,970
I'm putting away things related to Yan Heng.

432
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,420
But...

433
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,600
I haven't figured out how to tell my parents yet.

434
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
Anyway, that guy isn't often in China.

435
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,350
Your parents probably wouldn't think of him.

436
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,730
I'm an adult after all.

437
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,380
I don't want them to always worry about me.

438
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,230
I still want to handle it myself before telling them.

439
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,580
I don't want to keep it from them for too long either.

440
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,840
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

441
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,870
Take a day off tomorrow and rest at home.

442
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,830
Don't think too much. I'm hanging up.

443
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,760
I've finished all the medicine.

444
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:18,950
No big deal.

445
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,590
Hello, I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. He Suye.

446
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,550
You're Miss Shen, right?

447
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,480
Yes.

448
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,040
Dr. He

449
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,140
is not here today.

450
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,220
He only works here on Saturdays.

451
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,450
Usually, he works at the TCM hospital.

452
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,180
The TCM hospital?

453
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:33,690
Yes.

454
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,210
Do you want me to make an appointment with another doctor for you?

455
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,290
No.

456
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:38,820
Thank you.

457
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,450
Okay.

458
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,450
Okay, make sure to get enough rest.

459
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,250
Let me know if you have any problems.

460
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,650
Okay, thank you, doctor.

461
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,010
Why are you using my pen again?

462
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,450
You guys

463
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,910
organize today's ward round records later.

464
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,490
Also,

465
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,530
how's the osteosarcoma report

466
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,130
you two have been working on?

467
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:09,970
It's done,

468
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,820
but we still need to cross-check

469
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,350
some data and conclusions.

470
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,450
Okay. I can help you review it later.

471
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,980
Okay, thank you, Senior He.

472
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,010
Senior He,

473
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,690
I've finished my thesis too.

474
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,840
Can you also help me...

475
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,910
Sure, no problem.

476
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,670
You've all finished?

477
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:29,490
[So I want to ask if I can go to the TCM hospital.]
[Hello, Dr. He. I went for my follow-up visit, but I heard from the clinic that you're in the TCM hospital today.]

478
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm the only one who hasn't finished?

479
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,750
Aren't you ashamed?

480
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,150
How about this?

481
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,690
When Li Jie finishes his thesis,

482
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,490
I'll review both of yours together.

483
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,770
I might not have time after reviewing their report today.

484
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,490
Okay.

485
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,180
Why haven't you finished it yet?

486
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm working on it.

487
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,180
I can't believe you.

488
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,910
You're free today?

489
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,840
Yes, I'm having a day off today.

490
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,930
Then come.

491
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,010
Li Jie is careless.

492
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,890
Gu Ping, Qiu Tian,

493
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,380
take your theses with you later

494
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,580
and wait for me in the break room.

495
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,840
I have something to do.

496
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,140
Okay.

497
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,940
Okay, Senior.

498
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,420
Bye bye.

499
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,490
Bye bye.

500
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,590
Shen Xifan.

501
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,530
What's wrong?

502
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,530
I'm...

503
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,650
a bit haggard today.

504
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,600
You're getting better, right?

505
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,490
It's okay.

506
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,640
Actually, you don't need to give me special treatment.

507
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,210
I can just go to the outpatient clinic and register.

508
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm not giving you special treatment.

509
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,679
I'm not a doctor in the TCM department.

510
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,550
So you can't get an appointment with me in the outpatient clinic.

511
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,719
You... are not a TCM physician?

512
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
I am a TCM physician,

513
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,020
but I'm in the TCM oncology department.

514
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,010
Those who make appointments with me

515
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,050
are usually cancer patients.

516
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,300
I was worried the atmosphere in the oncology department might scare you,

517
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,090
so...

518
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,090
I arranged to meet you here instead.

519
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,139
Alright,

520
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,110
don't just stand here.

521
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,570
Go sit over there for a while.

522
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,130
Okay.

523
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,090
Why did you come for a follow-up visit so soon?

524
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,489
Didn't I just prescribe more medicine for you last Saturday?

525
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,449
I've finished all the medicine.

526
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,500
You've finished it all?

527
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,650
It's only been four days.

528
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:02,570
You finished a week's worth of medicine within four days?

529
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,420
I really couldn't fall asleep,

530
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,130
so I drank a bit more.

531
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,240
Medicine can be toxic too.

532
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,790
Even though it's herbal medicine, you can't drink it like that.

533
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,130
Dr. He,

534
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,320
are all these plants medicinal herbs?

535
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,860
Those

536
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,410
are perilla leaves.

537
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,720
Perilla leaves?

538
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Isn't that your name?

539
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,510
Perilla leaves might seem unremarkable,

540
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,450
but they're widely distributed and used.

541
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:34,180
For example,

542
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,450
you can wrap grilled meat with them.

543
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,950
Have a seat over there.

544
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,150
I'll take your pulse.

545
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:42,960
Okay.

546
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,740
Sit down.

547
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:50,860
Thank you.

548
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,690
Come on, let me take your pulse.

549
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,390
Don't move.

550
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,080
Keep your hand still while I'm taking your pulse.

551
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,890
How have you been lately?

552
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,180
How about your sleep

553
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,770
and mood?

554
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,320
Everything's been fine.

555
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,530
It's just that

556
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,050
I've been quite busy with work recently,

557
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,220
so I've been sleeping late and unable to get enough sleep.

558
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,820
But...

559
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,970
the quality of sleep is okay.

560
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,000
Maybe you should get a new doctor.

561
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,900
My medical skills aren't that great.

562
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,190
Dr. He,

563
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,750
last time you mentioned dietary restrictions.

564
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,900
And now you're giving up on me?

565
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,310
I didn't say that.

566
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,820
Your words sound like

567
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,940
I have no medical ethics.

568
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,960
Another hand.

569
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,700
I need to take your pulse.

570
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,090
Besides insomnia,

571
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,560
can you help with something else?

572
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,300
My mom said

573
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,790
I've been looking pale

574
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,860
and lacking energy lately.

575
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Of course.

576
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,020
But...

577
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,350
sleep is still the most important thing.

578
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,480
If you can't sleep well,

579
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,880
how can your body recover?

580
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,630
Right?

581
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,460
I...

582
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,930
It's not that I don't want to sleep.

583
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,170
Alright then.

584
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,540
Well,

585
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,490
I guess my medical skills are indeed not good enough.

586
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,490
I'll write you a prescription.

587
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:37,740
Done.

588
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,130
Take this prescription to the clinic and have them decoct the medicine.

589
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,090
If there are any issues,

590
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,750
tell them to call me directly.

591
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,850
Okay.

592
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,480
Thank you.

593
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,840
Remember, you must avoid certain foods.

594
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,030
No cold drinks.

595
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,140
If you really don't want to drink anything hot,

596
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,200
at least have it at room temperature.

597
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,250
How about...

598
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,420
no ice?

599
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,590
Drink whatever you want.

600
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,230
You're not exactly an obedient patient anyway.

601
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,890
If you want cold drinks, go ahead.

602
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,420
Maybe even eat two tubs of ice cream while you're at it.

603
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,620
That'll surely cure all your ailments.

604
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,600
You're a doctor.

605
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,850
Why are you getting mad at a patient?

606
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,080
Am I?

607
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,030
Yes, you are.

608
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,230
Fine, if you say so.

609
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,620
Well then, Dr. He,

610
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,550
I'll let you get back to work. I'm leaving.

611
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,140
Right,

612
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,050
thank you for sparing time to see me.

613
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,950
See you on Saturday.

614
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,340
See you on Saturday.
