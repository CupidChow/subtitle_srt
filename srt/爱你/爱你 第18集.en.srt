4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,610
It's almost time.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,039
I think it's almost over.

6
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,820
Arrange the shuttles in advance.

7
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,810
Don't waste time.

8
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,490
Okay, Manager.

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,520
I'll head over now.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,350
Okay, go ahead.

11
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,480
I'll leave it to you.

12
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,640
The weather is nice today.

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,360
Mr. Yan, look over here!

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,520
Mr. Yan, over here!

15
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,880
Mr. Yan, over here!

16
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,640
Mr. Yan, look over here!

17
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,720
See you later.

18
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,850
What's wrong, Dad?

19
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,120
Did you see the news?

20
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,250
The signing ceremony went well.

21
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course.

22
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,060
Now that the cooperation is settled, you can come back.

23
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,720
Don't waste time in Hang City.

24
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,880
I'll handle it myself.

25
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,500
You're marrying Shen Xifan to go against me.

26
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,680
Don't you think that's childish?

27
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,270
With your little achievements now,

28
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,150
you really think

29
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,829
you've fully established yourself in this industry?

30
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,839
I've already said

31
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,839
that I'll handle it myself.

32
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,190
Alright.

33
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,070
I'd like to see what you can actually achieve.

34
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,540
Unit 7, Room 502?

35
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes.

36
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,790
What's the owner's last name?

37
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,440
Shen.

38
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Yes.

39
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,040
Please come in.

40
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,840
Mr. Yan, it's done.

41
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,000
Ms. Liu,

42
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,910
I saw Yan on the public account of the hotel

43
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,909
where Ms. Shen is working.

44
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,830
It really is him.

45
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,070
What is this?

46
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,840
Their company

47
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,830
is holding an event at Gunan Huating Hotel?

48
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,300
Why didn't she tell us?

49
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,630
I knew it.

50
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,860
She's been in a really bad mood lately.

51
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,070
How long has Yan been back?

52
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,020
It's him, right? Look at this photo.

53
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,780
Definitely.

54
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,770
Where are you going?

55
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,670
To get some spicy hot pot.

56
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,510
You still have the mood to eat spicy hot pot?

57
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,950
Your house is on fire.

58
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,390
Are you kidding me?

59
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,760
I just left my house.

60
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,870
Look.

61
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,820
Chen Qiang?

62
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,350
Yes.

63
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,910
Just now, someone who looked

64
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,470
really rich and powerful

65
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,830
went to Shen's house to propose marriage.

66
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,370
Did he look like a boss?

67
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,210
Yes.

68
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,540
Thank you.

69
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,270
Mr. Yan, everything's here.

70
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,900
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

71
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,130
Long time no see.

72
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,150
Yes, yes.

73
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,070
What would you like to drink?

74
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,720
I...

75
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,150
I remember you like coffee, right?

76
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,190
No need to trouble yourself, Mr. Shen. I'll just have some water.

77
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,590
You can make do with that?

78
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,540
Please, have a seat.

79
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,770
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

80
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,060
Well,

81
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,470
it's been a while

82
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,870
since I heard from you.

83
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
I was busy with my startup last year.

84
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,460
Fortunately, the company is doing well now,

85
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,150
and we've won some awards.

86
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,180
I came back this time

87
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,270
mainly to handle

88
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,270
the company's move to the tech park.

89
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,460
I just came back from the signing ceremony this afternoon

90
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,990
and rushed over to see you.

91
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,300
Oh, right, Mr. and Mrs. Shen,

92
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,909
I brought some gifts for you from abroad.

93
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,980
Let me open them and show you.

94
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,300
Yan, sit first.

95
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,620
Well, Yan,

96
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,070
what do you mean by this?

97
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,540
I think the breakup last year

98
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,570
must have

99
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,980
made Xifan and you

100
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,180
feel uncomfortable.

101
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,270
But I came back this time

102
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,070
to get back together with Xifan.

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,730
When the time is right, we'll get married.

104
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,150
The breakup happened

105
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,180
partly because

106
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,910
I was too busy at the time,

107
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,160
and partly because

108
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,980
I didn't come to terms with it

109
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,860
and didn't want her to study abroad.

110
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,790
That's what led to where we are now.

111
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,590
But I've come to terms with it.

112
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,740
Letting her study abroad

113
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,000
and broaden her horizons is a good thing.

114
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,419
Nowadays, going abroad isn't that hard.

115
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,350
I can arrange for her to go to

116
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,280
any school she wants to right away.

117
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,500
We've been together for seven years,

118
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,720
and taking some time apart

119
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,789
could actually help our relationship in the long run.

120
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,990
Besides, we know each other so well.

121
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
We're a perfect match for marriage.

122
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,000
Aren't you staying at Xifan's hotel?

123
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,070
Why didn't she come back with you?

124
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,890
Does she know you're here?

125
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,190
Is marriage a one-person thing?

126
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,530
Do you know what Xifan thinks?

127
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,390
Mrs. Shen, please don't get angry.

128
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,420
Of course I know

129
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
it's not easy to get back with Xifan,

130
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,590
but I will do my best.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,780
Besides, you don't really know what happened between us.

132
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,670
The breakup happened because Xifan made a mistake first.

133
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,200
I never mentioned it, did I?

134
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,770
This time, I'm here with sincerity.

135
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,870
What are you doing in my house?

136
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,420
Visiting your parents.

137
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,070
What's wrong?

138
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,470
Visiting my parents?

139
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,200
What do you want to say?

140
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,740
You want me to marry you?

141
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,110
What do you want me to do to make you happy?

142
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,780
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

143
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Well, have you...

144
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,480
Have you ever cared about my feelings?

145
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm begging for your forgiveness.

146
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,700
What about you?

147
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,010
You just keep avoiding me,

148
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,840
making me look like a fool, searching for you everywhere.

149
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,480
Like a fool?

150
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,230
When we broke up,

151
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,030
wasn't this how you treated me?

152
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,580
When we broke up, you sent me a message

153
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,560
and then disappeared, Yan Heng.

154
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,700
Do you know how much I wanted to find you

155
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,850
and how much I wanted you to reply to my message?

156
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,660
At that time,

157
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,580
I would've gone back to you like a dog,

158
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,040
apologizing obediently.

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,830
But where were you?

160
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,100
Why is there someone else here?

161
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,550
Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen.

162
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,660
This is the medicinal soup I made.

163
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,170
But it's for four people.

164
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm not sure if it's enough for all of us.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
Here, take it.

166
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,800
Xifan.

167
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,000
Xifan.

168
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,480
Do you hate me so much now

169
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,210
because you've fallen for him?

170
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,030
What could a poor TCM physician

171
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,780
give you?

172
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,840
And what about you?

173
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,600
Besides some stupid money,

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,290
what can you give her?

175
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,030
Listen carefully.

176
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,110
Only those who have nothing to offer

177
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,840
would say something like this.

178
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,570
Yan Heng,

179
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,510
please get out of my house.

180
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,510
Mr. Shen...

181
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,030
No one here welcomes you!

182
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,790
Get out now!

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,660
You only care about yourself,

184
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,150
never considering how others feel.

185
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,480
Working at the hotel,

186
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,080
you should keep a professional attitude

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,520
and keep your distance from the customers.

188
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,330
Wasn't this part of your training when you just started working here?

189
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,290
Am I working this hard for myself?

190
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,600
What exactly are you dissatisfied with?

191
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
How can you be so willful?

192
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Do you know how much trouble

193
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,960
your willfulness has caused everyone?

194
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,410
Who can stand you?

195
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,300
Do you want to see how sad and hurt

196
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,180
he can be for you?

197
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,550
Or do you just want to prove how charming you are?

198
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,750
Why aren't you wearing socks in this cold weather?

199
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,910
Senior He has always been

200
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,870
a very gentle and kind person.

201
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,910
But that doesn't mean

202
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,630
you can treat him so casually.

203
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,670
You don't deserve him at all.

204
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,200
It's all my fault.

205
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,410
It's all my fault.

206
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,940
Xifan,

207
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,480
you did nothing wrong.

208
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
It was my fault today.

209
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,350
I shouldn't have opened the door for Yan.

210
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,900
How dare he come to our house?

211
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,750
How did he treat Xifan

212
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,250
when they broke up?

213
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,700
How dare he sit here, shamelessly saying

214
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,990
he wants to marry her?

215
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,870
Alright, alright.

216
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,940
Don't be so angry.

217
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,860
Now that we have clarified everything today,

218
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,340
it'll be fine from now on.

219
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,510
Did you hear what Xifan said today?

220
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,640
Yes.

221
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,800
It broke my heart.

222
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,140
When Xifan broke up with him,

223
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,940
he treated her that way.

224
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
She came home without saying a word,

225
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,030
keeping it from us.

226
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,030
She couldn't sleep every night,

227
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,180
suffering from insomnia,

228
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,580
and looked so exhausted.

229
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,590
She must have been

230
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,630
so heartbroken inside.

231
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,870
After that,

232
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,210
I arranged blind dates for her,

233
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,950
constantly asking her

234
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,360
to do this and that.

235
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,180
I'm her mother.

236
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,870
What did I do?

237
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,400
She was thinking of us.

238
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,910
During the New Year,

239
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
she seemed to be feeling better.

240
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,620
But then things went wrong again.

241
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,350
I noticed it at the time,

242
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,380
but I didn't think to call Lin

243
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,280
and Ya.

244
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
If I had called them,

245
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,280
she wouldn't have been so sad, right?

246
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,030
Come on.

247
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,580
Alright, alright.

248
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,460
Don't be angry.

249
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,860
Let me give you a massage.

250
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,090
Feeling better?

251
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,220
Yes.

252
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,760
What are you looking at?

253
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,070
Clean it up!

254
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,520
What's going on?

255
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,080
Mr. Yan is drunk

256
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,620
and smashed everything.

257
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,340
Mr. Yan,

258
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,820
you'll have to compensate for everything you damaged.

259
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,450
Get lost.

260
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,460
What now?

261
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
I said I'm not going back!

262
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,610
Take photos and videos of everything,

263
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,040
and go to the finance department tomorrow to assess the damages.

264
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Leave me alone.

265
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,930
Leave me alone!

266
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,590
Xifan.

267
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,040
Senior Lin,

268
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,230
I took a day off tomorrow.

269
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,120
Please keep an eye on the situation in the housekeeping division for me.

270
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,800
Call me if anything happens.

271
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,170
Okay, no problem.

272
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,600
It's Friday tomorrow.

273
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,170
Take a good rest these days.

274
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,430
Don't think about anything. Just relax.

275
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,540
Thank you.

276
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,620
Bye bye.

277
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,150
Come in.

278
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,870
You're up?

279
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,970
He sent you some medicine.

280
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,310
He said it's for calming your nerves

281
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,510
and asked you to drink it while it's hot.

282
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,740
Okay.

283
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,410
I'll drink it soon.

284
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,080
Why do you have to bear everything on your own?

285
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,440
Why didn't you tell us when you were hurt?

286
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,810
You even lied to us,

287
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,930
saying it was a peaceful breakup.

288
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,050
But you suffered a lot.

289
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,700
Didn't it hurt?

290
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,440
I'll say no more.

291
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,800
I didn't want you to worry.

292
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
But we are your family.

293
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,590
Remember,

294
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,840
no matter how old you are,

295
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,910
in your dad and my eyes,

296
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,020
you're always just a kid.

297
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,700
I didn't do it on purpose.

298
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,600
I thought I could handle it myself.

299
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
From now on, no matter what happens,

300
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,520
you mustn't hide it from us.

301
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,440
Got it?

302
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,250
Yes.

303
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,040
Sending it to the headquarters of Zhongyu Tech, right?

304
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,550
Yes.

305
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,040
The name is Yan Heng, right?

306
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
Yes.

307
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,840
Okay, thank you.

308
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,730
Did you brew today's medicine?

309
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,420
It smells refreshing.

310
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,440
Yes.

311
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,350
It's for relieving anxiety and calming the nerves.

312
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,680
I specially added acorus calamus for you.

313
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,420
♫A light scent♫

314
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,690
I took a sip.

315

♫Slowly awakening my heart♫

316

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,710

♫The unexpected encounter with the wind♫

320
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,320
When you wake up, everything will get better.

♫Layer by layer, rendering the air♫

339
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,500
Yes.

340
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,350
Time to eat.

341
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,340
Have a seat. Don't be shy.

342
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,950
Thank you for coming

343
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,950
to keep our Ms. Shen company.

344
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,910
Mr. Shen, you don't need to be so polite with us.

345
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,150
Alright, I won't.

346
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Right, Mrs. Shen?

347
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,480
Yes, that's right.

348
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,210
Don't be polite with us either.

349
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,810
Come over for dinner whenever you have time.

350
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,590
It's the first time I've seen you two after the New Year.

351
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,650
Your uncle has learned to make medicated dishes now,

352
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,110
and they taste pretty good.

353
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:16,660
Try some.

354
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,790
Xiangya, aren't you a food critic?

355
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,720
Give us a review.

356
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,770
Oh, okay.

357
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,690
Medicinal dishes, huh?

358
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,790
Oh, right.

359
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,010
Thank you, Mrs. Shen.

360
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,780
Let me tell you something funny.

361
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,550
Yesterday, Yan Heng went back to his room and caused a scene,

362
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,700
smashing everything.

363
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,170
We assessed the damage this morning,

364
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,500
and it's going to cost a lot to compensate.

365
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,070
He told me

366
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,870
that his dad scolded him terribly because of this.

367
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,370
Even Mr. Yan knows about this?

368
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,240
Why did he make such a big scene?

369
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,790
It was mainly embarrassing.

370
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,780
After all, he's the boss of a company now.

371
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,640
Getting drunk and causing a scene

372
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,130
is a bad look.

373
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,470
What was his original check-out date?

374
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,160
Wednesday.

375
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,510
Oh right, the General Manager talked to me today,

376
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,090
saying that he plans to refuse his extension

377
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,160
after it expires.

378
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,630
He is a VIP customer.

379
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,310
Is the General Manager really willing to do that?

380
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,110
If the General Manager

381
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,070
heard you say that,

382
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,870
he'd definitely be upset again.

383
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,870
This was something he brought up himself.

384
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,600
He said Yan Heng has a bad personality,

385
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,710
has gone too far,

386
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,600
and is too difficult to deal with.

387
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,120
Let's stop talking about this.

388
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,460
Remember to treat your General Manager to a meal

389
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,330
to thank him for his concern.

390
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,140
And bring these two with you

391
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,250
so it's livelier.

392
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,290
Don't worry. Thank you.

393
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,180
Eat more today.

394
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,760
Today's full of good news.

395
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,020
We can have a little wine.

396
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,060
-Why do you always find excuses to drink?
-Mr. Shen.

397
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,650
Come on. It's the weekend.

398
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,410
I don't have class tomorrow.

399
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,810
It's fine. I'll have a drink with Mr. Shen.

That's great, Xiangya.

Just a little.

Don't drink a couple of glasses with Mr. Shen

404
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,940

These two

412

are in a relationship.

-Great!

That's wonderful.

415

I'm really not being a Monday morning quarterback.

416
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,460
The first time I saw them,

417
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,440
I knew they'd end up together.

418
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,940
The feeling was really strong.

419
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,290
How long have you two known each other?

420
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,290
Almost 10 years.

430
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Mr. Shen, I won't drink.

431

Why doesn't Mrs. Shen let me drink?

She's afraid that after I get drunk,

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,880
I might start reciting in English, and she won't understand.

can you be my boyfriend?

515
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,150
Have you thought it through?

516
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,710
Yes.

517
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,050
So...

518
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,760
do you...

519
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,470
♫No fear of the night, no matter how long♫

520
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,300
♫Your voice is always gentle♫

521
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,460
♫Knowing you'll wait for me to take that brave step♫

522
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,770
♫Walking toward you♫

523
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,230
♫At the end of my dreams♫

524
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:08,230
♫Holding on tight, never letting go♫

525
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,670
♫Waiting for you♫

526
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,380
♫To heal every tomorrow for me♫

527
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,140
♫The best time♫

528
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,270
I'm 32 years old.

529
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,920
Do we really need to start from holding hands?

530
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,570
♫I'm willing to be with you♫

531
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,390
♫I'll go through every time and space with you♫

532
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,180
♫And you are the reason♫

533
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,490
♫I hold on to the moment so dearly♫

534
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,940
♫No fear of the night, no matter how long♫

535
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,760
♫Your voice is always gentle♫

536
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,800
♫Knowing you'll wait for me to take that brave step♫

537
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,400
♫Walking toward you♫

538
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,470
♫The best time♫

539
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,850
After you.

540
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,710
Okay.

541
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,840
What size shoes do you wear?

542
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,760
I can wear either size 6.5 or 7.

543
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:15,940
Got it.

544
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,510
After you change your shoes, you can sit in the living room for a while.

545
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,670
I need to change my shoes too.

546
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,420
Okay.

547
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,300
I'll go then.

548
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,090
Why are you here?

549
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,960
Why did you make so many of them?

550
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,420
Before,

551
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,760
whenever I thought about it, I would make one.

552
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,860
I just never had the chance to give them out.

553
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,390
He Suye.

554
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm sorry.

555
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,990
I must have made you wait a long time.

556
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,450
No. Don't overthink it.

557
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,990
You can throw away the old one.

558
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,870
It doesn't have any scent left.

559
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,880
Also, it has acorus calamus leaves in it,

560
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,840
which calm the mind and open the senses.

561
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,990
You don't need it now, do you?

562
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,230
I'm not throwing it away. It's too meaningful.

563
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,270
Besides,

564
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,270
The acorus calamus leaves really worked.

565
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,180
If I had known,

566
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I would have asked you to put in more.

567
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,270
I can't put in too much of them.

568
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:43,940
You can.

569
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,550
If you had put in more back then,

570
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,390
maybe

571
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,240
I would have come to my senses earlier.

572
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,590
Look.

573
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,420
Even my sense of smell knows

574
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,460
that I've fallen in love with you long ago.

575
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,500
But why did I

576
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,430
only realize it today?

577
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,760
It's okay.

578
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,940
It's not too late.

579
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,330
Now is just the right time.

580
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,500
In my eyes,

581
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,970
every day

582
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,690
you get better and more deserving of love

583
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,330
than the last.

584
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,910
So,

585
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,060
from now on,

586
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,490
just focus on loving yourself.

587
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,560
As for the rest,

588
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,320
leave it to me.

589
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:09,330
♫So I wait and wander, but the outcome isn't so bad♫

590
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:16,790
♫Sparrows gather on the windowsill, sunlight streaming through♫

591
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:24,840
♫Poets keep altering words to record the fast-changing world♫

592
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:32,230
♫A relationship or an accident♫

593
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,320
♫It became brighter because of you♫

594
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,380
♫The world suddenly became so cute♫

595
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,120
♫Maybe I'm too slow to understand♫

596
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,890
♫I can't confess my passionate love to you♫

597
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,880
♫Love is an admiration for beauty♫

598
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,800
♫I've decided to only love you♫

599
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,830
♫My foolishness♫

600
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,690
♫My sincerity♫

601
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,720
♫Only for one person♫

602
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,200
♫Because of you, even my smile brightens up♫
