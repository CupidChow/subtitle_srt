[Episode 4: Mint;
Pungent, cool, dispels wind-heat, clears head and eyes, soothes throat, promotes rashes, and regulates liver qi]

3
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:46,870
Okay.

4
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,210
As long as it's your prescription.

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,750
I'll pack the donkey-hide gelatin for her separately.

6
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,810
One week's dosage.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,910
Okay, no problem.

8
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,210
Then that's it for now.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,370
I've confirmed it. It's all good.

10
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,730
Please come to pick it up in four hours.

11
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,040
Okay, thank you.

12
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,510
See you.

13
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,970
See you.

14
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:10,710
Ms. Wu.

15
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,030
What's up?

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,150
Was that Miss Shen? She came again?

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,080
What's wrong?

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Dr. He asked me for her phone number.

19
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,430
Really?

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,000
I didn't even notice that.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
Shh, keep it down...

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,800
Tell me the story.

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,840
Feel the energy of nature.

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Perilla leaves.

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm craving barbecue.

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Nice handwriting, Dr. He.

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,550
This medicine's way too bitter.

28
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,760
What does it include this time?

29
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,310
It literally starts with the bitter goldthread.

30
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,910
Let me check the components.

31
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,380
Fried Atractylodes macrocephala...

32
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,220
What is it?

33
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,310
It appears dark brown...

34
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,040
Gosh, I can tell it's bitter just by looking at it.

35
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
Tree peony bark...

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
What else is in there?

37
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,280
Why are you still up at this hour?

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,740
Suffering from insomnia?

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,290
I'm about to hit the hay.

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,190
Stop scrolling on your phone before bed.

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,310
Ease your mind. It helps with sleep.

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,240
I saw your Moments.

43
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,240
You're not asleep either.

44
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,800
How can I reply to you if I don't scroll on my phone?

45
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,240
Fine.

46
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,600
Well.

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,050
Good night then.

48
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,159
Good night.

49
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,570
Goldthread...

50
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,500
It has to be swapped.

51
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,430
It's too bitter.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Charred gardenia fruit.

53
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,190
Looking so burnt and black,

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,650
it can be removed for sure.

55
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,570
And what else? Let me see.

56
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,260
Ms. Shen, you're amazing.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,720
Can't believe you actually napped all the way until now.

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm back from school already.

59
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,950
I woke up once,

60
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,270
went to the bathroom and fell asleep again.

61
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,270
Are you hungry?

62
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,070
If you're hungry, let your dad heat the food for you.

63
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,530
The dishes have gone cold.

64
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,510
I have no appetite.

65
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,250
I feel like I've slept for too long.

66
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm still groggy.

67
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,820
I want to go downstairs for a walk.

68
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,390
Do you two want to come with me?

69
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,510
I can't go.

70
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,970
I'm still grading papers.

71
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,240
Mom.

72
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,930
You want me to go with you?

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,230
But the dating variety show I've been binge-watching

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,640
has a new episode today.

75
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,990
Alright then.

76
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,210
I'll go freshen up.

77
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,190
Dad.

78
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,400
Help me heat up the TCM liquid later.

79
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

80
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,790
Okay.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,100
Does the medicine taste that bad?

82
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,510
There's still some left.

83
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,240
Take a sip, huh?

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,159
Why would I?

85
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,420
I don't have insomnia.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
Why are you out skateboarding

87
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,420
at this hour today?

88
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm feeling groggy

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,100
after a day's work.

90
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,570
So I'm out to get some fresh air and unwind.

91
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
What's that look?

92
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,520
I can't skateboard?

93
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,500
I think Tai Chi suits you better.

94
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,430
Then, should I wear

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,190
a traditional suit

96
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,870
for Tai Chi?

97
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,430
Yes.

98
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,230
With a pair of plain cloth shoes.

99
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,320
Are you really unbiased like you said?

100
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you think TCM physicians are all old men?

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,000
They're always respectfully referred to as "Old TCM Physicians."

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,730
If they're not old, why are they addressed as  "Old TCM Physicians"?

103
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,170
You seem to be in good spirits today.

104
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,020
I'm not mocking you.

105
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,740
"Old" doesn't only refer to age.

106
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,510
It's also about experience and professional capabilities.

107
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm complimenting you.

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,830
After taking your medicine yesterday,

109
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,360
I slept for four hours in the afternoon.

110
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
It's very effective.

111
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,880
Now we're talking.

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
I'll go grab something at the convenience store ahead.

113
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,180
Are you coming with me?

114
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,830
Sure.

115
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,680
I'll go buy some snacks.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,210
Let's go.

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,740
What do you want to buy?

118
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,870
I haven't decided yet.

119
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,270
I'll just browse around.

120
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,610
What about you?

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,040
If I'm taking TCM medicine,

122
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,190
can I drink cold Coke?

123
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,240
Of course not.

124
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,950
What about Sprite?

125
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,550
No.

126
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,870
Then can I eat spicy strips?

127
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,130
Do you need anything else?

128
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,289
I'll add on this too.

129
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,039
Thank you.

130
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
In total, it's...

131
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,800
Just scan my payment code.

132
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,720
Xifan.

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,990
I bought this for you.

134
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Does it taste good?

135
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,400
You drink this every time.

136
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,980
It's really good!

137
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,140
C'mon, give it a try.

138
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,430
What's wrong?

139
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,000
Nothing.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Is it good?

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,210
It's alright.

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,640
I prefer the mint flavor.

143
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,380
This is for you.

144
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,640
Why are you giving me candies?

145
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,240
Didn't you complain about TCM's bitterness?

146
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,320
You can have a piece of mint candy

147
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,180
each time you drink the medicine.

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,710
The mint candy

149
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,790
can help clear heat and detoxify.

150
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,850
It won't mess with the medicine you're taking.

151
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:49,750
Okay.

152
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,720
Why are you smiling?

153
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,940
I think you're too much of a workaholic.

154
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,130
Even to give me some candies, you had to justify it with the TCM theory.

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,550
What else should I say?

156
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,840
"I'm giving you a pack of candies

157
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,030
to wish you a sweet life?"

158
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,000
It's better to wish my heat cleared

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,790
and de... detoxified?

160
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:19,300
♫Continuous gloom, my failures, hard to let go♫

161

♫But love comes with hurt; I'm a fool, never able to figure it out♫

162

163
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,510
Building No. 2.

164

♫Even if you don't give me an answer about the future♫

165

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,790
Alright.

167
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,470
Well, then...

168
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,380
Good night.

169
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,860
Good night.

170
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,090
Thank you for the mint candies.

[Staff Canteen]

179
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,000
He,

180
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,030
what time are you going to the First People's Hospital this afternoon?

181
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,360
Could you give me a ride?

182
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,920
Why should I go there?

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Isn't your father,

184
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,910
Professor He,

185
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,670
going to hold a seminar there

186
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,720
this afternoon?

187
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,410
Are you not going with him?

188
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
He's a doctor of Western medicine.

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Why would I go to a Western medicine seminar?

190
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,770
Indeed...

191
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,670
Professor He got transferred to Bei City two years ago, didn't he?

192
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,380
During that time, did he...

193
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,650
Do you have

194
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,420
many appointments today?

195
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,150
Yep.

196
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,900
There are tons.

197
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,600
That's why I'm here to eat so late.

198
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,320
Then quickly grab a bite

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
and get back to work.

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,530
Yes, yes. I'm starving.

201
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,490
I should quickly eat up and work.

202
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,960

Not really.

from all major hospitals across our city

314
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,240
Look at this quickly.

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,550
Someone posted a photo of a handsome guy in the residents' group chat.

316
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,720
He's really hot!

317
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,790
Come and take a look.

318
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,650
Is he handsome?

319
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,160
How old are you?

320
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,830
His looks are stunning!

321
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,160
Stop making a fuss.

322
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,310
I'm obsessed with handsome guys out there

323
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,310
as the man at home ain't attractive.

324
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,020
Isn't he handsome?

325
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,750
Look at the group chat.

326
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,870
Zhang and Wang are all asking for his WeChat,

327
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,030
wanting to arrange a blind date with their daughter.

328
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,880
Our community neighbourhood

329
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,400
hasn't been this lively for a long time.

330
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,060
Everyone's talking about it.

331
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,830
He is pretty handsome

332
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,790
and looks smart.

333
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,520
Isn't it the clinic you've been to for treatment?

334
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,570
Yeah, that's right...

335
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,440
It's the clinic where I got you the medicine.

336
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,750
Look! I'm familiar with this background.

337
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,720
And also, look at the drawer behind...

338
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
I think so...

339
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,830
Really?

340
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,150
Give it to me.

341
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,590
This clinic

342
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,960
is near our neighborhood.

You're even telling them that?

Why not?

486
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,110
I'd go home for a nap.

I don't want to go home.

488

Since my mom found out that I go to your clinic,

489

she kept asking me if I knew you.

490

What did you say?

491
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,970
I said I don't know you, of course.

492

Otherwise, she'd definitely ask me for your WeChat.

If that happens,

494
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,830
everyone in the neighbourhood

495
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,160

502
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,480
Don't even mention it. Today, I've finally come to realize

503

Sometimes I feel like I'm a horse.

505

507

fur, and teeth.

508
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
Sometimes

509
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:47,070
I feel like I'm a chunk of pork

510
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,270
being judged and picked by purchasers,

511
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,270
yet no one thinks of me

512
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,470
as a person with emotions and thoughts.

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,550

514
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
May I ask

515
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,960
how old you are?

516
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,110
31.

517
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,400
You're already 31,

518
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,880
yet you only have that realisation now?

519
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,610
Doesn't your family give you marriage pressure?

520
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,000
My grandpa pushes me sometimes.

521
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,160
But I have been busy with work.

522
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,880
So I didn't pay much attention to it.

523
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,770
It's also possible

524
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,400
that the right person

525
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
hasn't appeared yet.

526
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,410
Let's start.

527
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,820
I'll close my eyes and take a rest.

528
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,350
Is the IT Summit over?

529
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,070
You're in a good mood now.

530
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,490
Don't move.

531
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,720
How did you know

532
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,920
I was at the IT summit?

533
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,590
I saw it on the news.

534
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,240
I was on TV?

535
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,960
I wonder if I looked good on camera.

536
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,270
You looked pretty good.

537
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,550
Good

538
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,270
What do you work as in the hotel?

539
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,270
I'm the manager of the Front Office.

540
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,020
What does the manager of the Front Office do?

541
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,700
Like, doing reception work in the lobby?

542
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,020
No. The one you're talking about

543
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,890
is the hotel lobby manager.

544
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,110
Our job mainly includes

545
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,960
checking room reservations,

546
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,440
arranging rooms,

547
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,900
and attending events and meetings

548
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,960
during holidays

549
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,760
with the Marketing Department.

550
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,240
For example, we were pretty busy

551
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,680
during the IT Summit this time.

552
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,270
We needed to gather the participants

553
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,030
in the same area

554
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,880
for better service and management.

555
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,200
Besides,

556
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,790
we had plenty of other work to handle.

557
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,550
Like

558
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,830
changing their sheets and quilt covers

559
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,760
or setting up the mini wine party they wanted

560
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,410
in the room.

561
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,960
So you know what?

562
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,550
I've been swamped with work lately.

563
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,640
I saw it.

564
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,790
It was pretty tiring.

565
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:03,320
♫You're like a gentle wind♫

566
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:09,330
♫After early summer afternoon, it blows past my heart♫

567
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,830
♫When your fingers touch my hands♫

568
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,180
♫So you're also here for me♫

569
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,180
♫I hear you say, red beans grow in the southern lands♫

570
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,020
♫When spring comes, a few branches begin to sprout♫

571
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,020
♫Cherish the youth♫

572
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,780
♫Loving you is the best thing I've ever done♫

573
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,630
♫Among the vast sea of people, you and I understand each other♫

574
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,400
♫Missing you is the most beautiful thing in my life♫

575
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,550
♫Write it down in your heart and never disappear♫

576
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,160
Wake up.

577
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,750
What's this scent?

578
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,960
It's so good. I fell asleep after smelling it.

579
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
You're sharp-nosed.

580
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,690
Alright.

581
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,360
Put on your shoes and get up.

582
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,110
Your sachet's scent must have worn off by now, huh?

583
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,170
I made you a new one.

584
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,620
Thank you.

585
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,870
And the prescription is also done.

586
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,230
Thanks.

587
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,800
What's that look on your face?

588
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,310
What's wrong?

589
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,200
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

590
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,680
Nope.

591
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,020
Well, Dr. He,

592
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,410
can we

593
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,110
remove the goldthread?

594
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,010
No.

595
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,720
Fine.

596
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,030
Then can we

597
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,760
remove this charred gardenia?

598
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,200
No.

599
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,730
Alright.

600
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,110
Can we...

601
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,310
Are you questioning my medical skills?

602
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,120
No, I don't mean that.

603
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
It's just...

604
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,110
After taking the medicine,

605
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,880
I did a quick research.

606
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,230
I found that the goldthread and charred gardenia have the same medicinal properties.

607
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,940
They both help clear heat and reduce dampness.

608
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,929
It's unnecessary to have two sorts of herbs

609
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,270
with the same medicinal properties

610
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,909
in one prescription, right?

611
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,920
You call that a quick research?

612
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,590
I think you're just afraid of extra expenses if I prescribe

613
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,960
extra medicinal materials.

614
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,590
No.

615
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,710
So why?

616
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,250
Dr. He,

617
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,060
the medicine last time

618
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,060
was way too bitter.

619
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,760
Someone

620
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,250
can endure either hardships at work

621
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,199
or pain in life.

622
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,570
Yet she can't bear to take a small pack of bitter herbal medicine.

623
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,850
They're not the same.

624
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,510
TCM offers real bitterness

625
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,230
that I need to swallow.

626
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,970
So you studied TCM to avoid

627
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,340
this bit of bitterness?

628
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,300
What a hardworking girl.

629
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,080
Thank you.

630
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:06,880
Tell me

631
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,440
if there's anything else you wanna remove.

632
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,960
No more.

633
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,840
Are you sure?

634
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,800
Dr. He, let me do you a favor.

635
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,920
What?

636
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,680
Check this out.

637
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,240
Does it look like a ring?

638
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,770
Gimme your hand.

639
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,510
C'mon!

640
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,580
Take it.

641
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,530
You're welcome.

642
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,920
Are you asking me to

643
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,700
pretend to be married?

644
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,280
This is all I can do to help you.

645
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:35,400
As for the rest,

646
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,030
it depends on your acting skills.

647
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,960
Thank you for the medicine

648
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,890
and your sachet.

649
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,840
Bye.

650
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,640

Auntie.

663

♫A long, drifting line remains♫

664
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,210
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

665
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,040
♫Filled with thoughts of loving you♫

666
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,370
Wait a second.

667
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,960
You...

668
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,780
It's a wedding ring.

669
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,180
You're already married?

670
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,890
Then why are you looking at my daughter's information?

671
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:46,960
I thought

672
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,150
you wanted me to see

673
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,060
her complexion.

674
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,750
Auntie,

675
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,360
your daughter's complexion

676
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,950
shows that she has a deficiency in qi and blood.

677
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,680
What's wrong with the people in the group?

678
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,840
They didn't even bother to check the situation clearly.

679
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,000
He's clearly already married.

680
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
Seriously.

681
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,680
Auntie, tell your daughter to make an appointment with me.

682
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,910
Who posted this in the group?

683
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,100
This doctor is already married. Who posted this?

684
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,240
Isn't it just messing with us?

685
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,390
Exactly, exactly.

686
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,580
How unlucky. I thought this doctor was quite suitable.

687
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,130
Dr. He, I have dinner plans with friends tonight.

688
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,040
I won't have time to pick up the medicine.

689
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,480
Could you please help me pick it up?

690
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,070
Okay.

691
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,270
Dr. He, I've arrived at the park near my home.

692
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,360
Please enjoy your meal.

693
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Ms. Shen,

694
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
come here.

695
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,050
What a coincidence!

696
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,910
Your dad just ordered.

697
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,630
Come quickly.

698
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,370
Change meeting location, change meeting location.

699
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,390
Reply if you received.

700
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:17,950
Fine.

701
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,220
Give it to me.

702
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,150
How did you end up here?

703
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,070
Sit down quickly.

704
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,090
The buns are still hot.

705
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,610
How did you all end up here?

706
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,200
Your dad insisted on eating buns today.

707
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,400
I don't want to cook.

708
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,770
Have some vinegar.

709
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,060
Okay.

710
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,000
Is it okay if I pour your vinegar here?

711
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,730
That's fine.

712
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:40,930
It's pork.

713
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,070
There's also some bamboo shoots inside.

714
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,030
What are you doing?

715
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,670
Mosquito.

716
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,590
Why would there be mosquitoes this season?

717
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,990
There are no mosquitoes.

718
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,230
Stop messing around, stop it.

719
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:51,800
Hurry up.

720
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Quickly, eat up.

721
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't fool around.

722
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,280
Stop shaking it.

723
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,940
You'll drop your phone again.

724
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,360
Eat quickly.

725
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,330
I suddenly got a message.

726
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,110
The clinic is asking me

727
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,670
to go pick up the medicine quickly.

728
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,890
They're waiting for me.

729
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,710
Don't go.

730
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,880
I'll pick it up for you later, won't that do?

731
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,400
No need, no need.

732
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm finished eating.

733
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,070
I'll go over in a bit, okay?

734
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,630
It's so late.

735
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,070
Let your dad go with you.

736
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,920
No need. My dad should stay with you.

737
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,450
I can't break up the couple.

738
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,280
Dr. He,

739
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,930
you just scared me to death.

740
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,870
What's wrong?

741
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,950
You just appeared in front of my parents like that.

742
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,520
Aren't you afraid they'll recognize you?

743
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,090
What's wrong with that?

744
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,290
What's the need to be so mysterious?

745
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,930
If they recognize you,

746
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,230
they'll definitely ask for your contact information.

747
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,880
Then all the elderly in our neighborhood

748
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,140
will have your WeChat.

749
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,010
That's true.

750
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,630
I forgot about that.

751
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,350
Yes.

752
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,110
Your medicine.

753
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,310
Take it, it's a bit heavy.

754
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,070
Be careful.

755
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,920
Thank you.

756
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:27,880
Um,

757
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,130
this thing that you gave me at noon

758
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,370
is missing.

759
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
I lost it.

760
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,860
It disappeared right when I got off work.

761
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:36,850
How about

762
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
I buy you another one?

763
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,280
It's okay, no need.

764
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,530
It wasn't expensive anyway.

765
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,990
I'm glad it could help you.

766
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,140
Okay.

767
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,520
Well, I'm heading home then.

768
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,340
Good night.

769
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,910
Good night.

770
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,920
By the way.

771
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,450
Don't rush.

772
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,790
Go in after a while.

773
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,870
Don't let my parents see us together.

774
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:05,800
Okay.

775
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,140
Good night.

776
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,970
Bye-bye.

777
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,870
Why so mysterious?
