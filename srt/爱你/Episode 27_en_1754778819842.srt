[Sweet and spicy in taste and warm in nature.
It nourishes and activates blood, regulates menstrual cycles, and alleviates pain.]

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,900
What are you doing?

4
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,760
I'm watching a show.

5
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,650
Watching a show? You don't usually do that.

6
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,040
I checked the dates.

7
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,710
Your visa should be approved soon, right?

8
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,190
Then why do you look so upset?

9
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,579
Isn't getting your visa a good thing?

10
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,190
He Suye.

11
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,110
I don't want to study abroad anymore.

12
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Because of Mrs. Shen?

13
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,400
Actually, after everything that's happened,

14
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,060
I feel like whether I study abroad or not isn't important anymore.

15
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,720
I want to stay and spend more time with my mom.

16
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Just now…

17
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,000
I was planning to look for a new job.

18
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,410
I completely understand you.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,460
But Mrs. Shen's condition

20
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,730
is really optimistic.

21
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,140
Besides, I'm here.

22
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,380
I can take care of her.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Do you not trust me?

24
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,800
I do trust you.

25
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,400
Remember what you told me?

26
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,829
You wanted to see the world out there

27
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,560
so you could figure out what you truly want.

28
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,800
Dr. He,

29
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,980
actually, I want to study abroad.

30
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,110
I want to go out and see the world

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,190
so I can know

32
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,440
what I truly want.

33
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,710
Then there's your answer.

34
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,529
Your life,

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,870
your choices.

36
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,760
Don't let anything else

37
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
cloud your judgment.

38
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,220
Alright.

39
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,170
Don't be upset.

40
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,360
No matter what you decide,

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,420
as your boyfriend,

42
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,159
I'll fully support you.

♫So I wait and wander, but the outcome isn't so bad♫

44
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,050

48
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,920
Ms. Liu, are you ready?

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,680
Coming.

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,800
Let me get you your shoes.

51
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,510
Let's go.

52
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,220
We're leaving.

53
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,400
You look so energetic today.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Do I?

55
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,750
I think

56
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,100
I've gotten used to the treatment lately.

57
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,750
I sleep well and eat well.

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
I can even go to work now.

59
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,360
That's great.

60
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,390
I can do it myself.

61
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,310
Did you bring the medical card?

62
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,370
Yes, and clothes too.

63
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,230
Okay. Let's go.

64
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,880
Almost done, right?

65
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,390
She's coming out.

66
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,700
Thank you.

67
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,930
Amazing! You did it.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
After so many rounds of chemo,

69
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,830
this is the last one.

70
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,840
Isn't your mom amazing?

71
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
We've got something special for you

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,390
to mark the occasion.

73
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,330
A little fire-crossing ceremony.

74
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,909
Come on.

75
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,490
Since open flames aren't allowed in the hospital,

76
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,880
she came up with this idea last night.

77
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,470
Just step over it.

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,310
Okay.

79
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,650
Take it slow.

80
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,360
Come on.

81
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,580
One, two, three.

82
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,920
Good!

83
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,360
Thank you

84
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,160
and He

85
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,270
for being here all this time.

86
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,180
It's nothing.

87
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,250
You've been through so much.

88
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
It's so hot! So hot!

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Sit down and rest for a while.

90
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,280
Come.

91
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,070
Careful.

92
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,450
Have some water.

93
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,850
You just had a shower?

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
The shower

95
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,160
made me feel refreshed.

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm almost done here.

97
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,870
He said you got your visa.

98
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,280
Let me see it.

99
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,070
Who is this beautiful girl?

100
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,720
Mom.

101
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,290
Look at my daughter.

102
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
So beautiful, so graceful,

103
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,480
and so filial.

104
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,590
You don't want to study abroad anymore?

105
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,440
You're worried about me?

106
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,000
My surgery was a success,

107
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,790
and the chemo is done too.

108
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,240
All that's left is taking my meds and focusing on recovery.

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,840
Your dad will take care of me.

110
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,320
Besides, there's Dr. He and Professor Yu.

111
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,440
They both said

112
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,340
they'll do their best to help me recover.

113
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,900
But I...

114
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,960
I know you want to stay and keep me company.

115
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,750
But as you know,

116
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,170
cancer cells will always be there.

117
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,550
They won't disappear

118
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,280
just because you stay by my side.

119
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,440
I still remember

120
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,080
the day you first told your dad and me

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,320
that you wanted to study abroad.

122
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,150
At that moment,

123
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,150
your eyes were shining.

124
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,830
You had dreams and plans for the future.

125
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,840
You worked so hard for this.

126
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,240
If you gave it up now because of me,

127
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,510
I would feel so guilty.

128
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,750
Mom.

129
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,140
Your life

130
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,400
is yours to live.

131
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,590
I never want to hold you back.

132
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,590
Even if one day

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,470
your dad and I are no longer here,

134
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,980
you still need to have

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,060
your own fulfilling life.

136
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,660
That's what

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,740
would truly make me relieved and happy.

138
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,320
So promise me you'll go study abroad.

139
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,840
You must go and live

140
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,000
your own life.

Let me introduce myself first.

171
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,680
My name is He Suye.

172
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,720
Thank you all for choosing my elective course,

173
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,790
"TCM Oncology."

174
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,630
In this course, I'll share with you

175
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,300
TCM techniques, methods, and prescriptions

176
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,780
for treating tumors.

177
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,790
Of course,

178
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,600
I'll also include some of

179
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,730
my own case studies,

180
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,090
hoping they can inspire you

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,780
and help you connect the dots.

182
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
To be honest,

183
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,960
before I came in,

184
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,590
I was worried that no one signed up for this course.

185
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,280
But since you're all here,

186
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,000
I won't go easy on you

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,930
just to keep you from dropping out.

188
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,390
Attendance will be taken,

189
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,940
and all required papers must be submitted.

190
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,090
Otherwise, I'll deduct points, okay?

191
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,590
You're all top students,

192
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,360
so surely you wouldn't fail to get enough credits

193
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,870
because you failed one elective course, right?

194
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,120
We totally would.

195
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,450
Well, this is what I call

196
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,270
"If I had to go through the thorns,

197
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,890
then you all have to get pricked too."

198
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,490
Mr. He, what's your WeChat?

199
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,670
Should we create a course group chat?

200
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes!

201
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,460
Let's skip WeChat.

202
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
If you need anything, just email me.

203
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,570
I'll reply anytime before 6 p.m.

204
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,380
But after that, I'll be with my girlfriend.

205
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,880
Mr. He,

206
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,730
what if there are last-minute announcements?

207
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,550
That's a problem.

208
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,370
How about this?

209
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll get a teaching assistant.

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,650
You all know Li Jie from the first-year PhD program, right?

211
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,930
No.

212
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,720
I'll have him join the group chat on my behalf.

213
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,320
If there's anything urgent, just contact him.

214
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,670
Alright, let's start the class.

215
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,050
Not bad.

216
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,800

217
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
What's up, kid?

218
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,540
Emergency case.

219
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,310
You need acupuncture now. Your life is in danger.

220
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,870
Where are my needles?

221
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,120
Suye is the worst.

222
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,050
He's making me work for free again.

223
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,000
It's normal.

224
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,100
Haven't you gotten used to it?

225
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,450

I'm staying at home

My flight is really early.

279

You'd have to get up around five.

280
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,960
It'd affect your work in the afternoon.

♫Far, away, we part, our ways♫

374
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:07,190

377

Your recovery is going well.

378
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
Make sure to get plenty of rest.

379
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,050
Come back for a follow-up visit next week.

380
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,790
Okay. Thank you, Dr. He.

381
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,050
Not at all. It's my job.

382
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
With a seven-hour time difference,

383
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,510
it must be just after 5 a.m. in Switzerland.

384
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,940
It's past 11 now.

385
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
She's probably

386
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,940
still in class.

387
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,720
He Suye,

388
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,720
I went out with my classmates today

389
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,110
and bought a really pretty postcard.

390
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,140
I wrote a little secret on it,

391
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,720
and I'm mailing it back home tomorrow.

392
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,320
Make sure to check your mail.

393
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,440
Also,

394
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,340
I miss you.

395
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,590
My girl who's far away from home, may this letter find you well.

396
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,260
The time difference is rough,

397
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,220
but by the time you send your postcard,

398
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,050
I should have sent this letter too.

399
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,060
Hopefully, we'll receive them on the same day.

400
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,710
Good news:

401
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,450
Ms. Liu's recovery is going well,

402
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,110
probably thanks to the wellness exercises my grandpa taught her.

403
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,170
Mr. Shen keeps her company every day,

404
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,710
so there's no need to worry.

405
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,040
Bad news:

406
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,110
I miss you very much.

407
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,840
He Suye, October 21.

408
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,270
While taking a walk tonight,

409
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,510
I noticed all the osmanthus flowers around the complex had fallen.

410
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,640
It's a bit of a shame.

411
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,950
Thinking back,

412
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,230
this time last year, we were still taking a walk together.

413
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,970
Maybe the flowers didn't bloom so early last year?

414
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,970
Also, I learned how to make osmanthus cake.

415
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,230
I promise you'll get to try it this time next year.

416
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,910
He Suye, October 26.

417
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,270
I met Senior Lin today.

418
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,650
He told me that after your first visit to see me,

419
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,280
you actually planned to set me up with Xiangya.

420
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,070
Now I finally know

421
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,330
what nonsense was in your head back then.

422
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,080
I bet the moment you read this letter,

423
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,320
you'll be drowning in regret and embarrassment.

424
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,920
He Suye, November 28.

425
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,750
I had malatang tonight.

426
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,070
The owner asked me to send his regards.

427
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,030
He still remembers the first time you tried the plain broth

428
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,550
and went on about it for quite a while.

429
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,110
It reminded me of how you once joked

430
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,480
that I was a vegetarian monk.

431
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,699
♫A light scent♫

432
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,179
I was so mad that I didn't know what to say.

433
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,150
But it's okay.

435
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:30,050

♫The unexpected encounter with the wind♫

443
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,840

450
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,440

♫Longing adjusts its frequency♫

459
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,390
doesn't mean you should blindly sympathize with Li Jie.

Look what happened.

461
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,930
He used your WeChat messages to force me to revise his paper.

♫Resonating with our expectations♫

463
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,310
I'm strongly against this kind of behavior,

464
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,610
and I'm holding you accountable.

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,680

Lately, I've been so busy that my head's spinning.

471
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,870
So I took a break and went to West Lake to watch the sunrise.

♫To blend the soothing scent of love♫

473
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,960
It cleared my mind a lot.

474
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,420

476
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,350
I keep thinking about

477
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,170
the time when you were preparing to study abroad.

478
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,960

♫The air♫

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,760

♫Love becomes familiar♫

483
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,550
It's a bit of a dark thought.

484
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,240
Maybe it's because I miss you too much.

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,840
But even if we could do it all over again,

487

I believe we'd still make the same choice.

No, thanks.

What are you doing?

508
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,150
I'm taking a selfie

509
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,750
to match my profile picture.

510
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,300
So the leaf in your profile picture is a tea leaf?

511
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,330
I always thought it was a perilla leaf.

512
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,320
Green tea…

513
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,360
Green tea boy!

514
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,400
That suits you. You're quite conniving sometimes.

515
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,650
Just as I thought.

516
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,250
What are you drawing?

00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,330

519
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,050
What's the meaning of this leaf?

520
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm not telling you.

521
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm so good at drawing.

522
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,680
This looks exactly like you.

It suits you perfectly.

524
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,700

Class is over.

533
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,070
Check this out. Nice view, right?

534
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,590
Where are you?

535
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,230
I just finished work

536
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,490
and came out for a walk.

537
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,030
I watched the video you sent me.

538
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,430
That place is beautiful.

539
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,230
Yeah, there's even a tea garden.

540
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,430
It must be very hot there now, right?

541
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,910
It'll cool down soon.

542
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,950
It's not very hot,

543
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,480
and it's drizzling,

544
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,040
but I find it quite cool.

545
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,150
It's mainly because I feel cold inside.

546
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,120
Cold inside?

547
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,880
What do you mean?

548
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,480
It wasn't easy for me to get a girlfriend,

549
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,980
but she drew a profile picture for me to roast me.

550
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,640
That's why I feel cold inside.

551
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,920
It took you so long to realize that.

552
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,120
Just you wait.

553
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,570
We'll settle this when you come back.

554
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,400
That won't do.

555
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,240
Tonight,

556
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,790
I'll write you a letter too.

557
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,290
I've been using this profile picture for over a year.

558
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,620
You really think one letter is enough to make me forgive you?

559
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,550
I read that letter many times.

560
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,060
Dr. He, you really put your heart into it.

561
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,740
Alright.

562
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,650
When are you coming back?

563
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,670
Don't tell me you haven't bought your plane ticket yet.

564
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,830
Buy it now.

565
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,330
I've saved up my annual leave.

566
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,030
During the summer holiday, we can go on a trip

567
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,890
with your parents and my grandpa.

568
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,390
What's wrong?

569
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,010
You don't want to come back?

570
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,750
Are you so happy there that you don't want to return?

571
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,900
That's not the case.

572
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,740
I really miss you.

573
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,000
It's just that…

574
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,630
Shen Xifan,

575
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
we're seven hours apart.

576
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,810
If you don't tell me, no one will.

577
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,580
Don't worry.

578
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,170
Here's the thing.

579
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,280
As you know,

580
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,500
my global internship ends next week.

581
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,010
But I've got a new opportunity.

582
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,970
It's a two-month internship at a six-star hotel.

583
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,570
They only need five interns.

584
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,410
I think it's a rare opportunity,

585
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,660
so I signed up.

586
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:54,800
You already did?
