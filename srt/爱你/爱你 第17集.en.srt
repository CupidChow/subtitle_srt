You're not gonna submit your homework today?

4
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,570
Is she asleep?

5
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,500
Has work been tough lately again?

6
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,590
Sweet dreams.

7
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:36,120
If possible,

8
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,630
I also hope you can recover faster.

9
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,150
Xifan, when do you get off work?

10
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,480
Let me give you a ride.

11
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,079
Since you flirted with me first,

12
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,410
you should be responsible for me.

13
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,400
You can't just walk away.

14
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,000
Xifan,

00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,700
let's get back together.

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,740
Xifan,

17
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,140
let's get back together.

18
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,510
Go away. Go away!

I'll

23
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,470
submit it to you tomorrow.

24
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,350

How is your work in Hang City going?

26
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,590
Proceeding normally.

27
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,990
I'll go have a look in the park this afternoon.

28
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,930
Handle the work as you see fit.

29
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,050
Come back when you're done there.

30
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,380
Don't stay in Hang City.

31
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Don't worry.

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,880
When the time is right,

33
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,530
I'll go back with Shen Xifan.

Yan Heng,

35
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,430
I advise you to think carefully.

36
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,670
Without my support,

37
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,490
do you really think your company can run normally?

38
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,080
We'll see.

39
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,270
Alright, I'm hanging up.

40
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,890

42
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,890
You're disobeying me for Shen Xifan.

43
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,080
Mr. Yan, the flowers you asked for are ready.

44
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
But there's a traffic jam.

45
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
We need to leave as soon as possible.

46

Yes.

53
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,630
Did you buy it outside?

54
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,810
Freshly brewed ones wouldn't be this clear.

55
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
You really have sharp eyes.

56
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,680
That's an F.

57
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,560
Come to my place tonight for a remedial session.

58
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,200
Maybe another day. I have something to do today.

Okay.

Let's meet another day.

Luckily, Mr. Yan went out to work today.

62
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,590
That has saved us a lot of trouble in the hotel.

63
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,400
Getting off work peacefully!

64

How long has it been?

65
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,470
Does it still have any smell?

66
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,800
A little.

67
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,440
What kind of smell?

68
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,400
Let me smell it.

69
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,990
Why don't you ask him for a new one?

70
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,990
I haven't had time to see him lately.

71
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,870
What's going on?

72
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,680
Xifan.

73
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,620
Mr. Yan, don't you need to work?

74
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,590
You are so free.

75
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,020
I just rushed back from a meeting.

76
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,350
Let's have dinner together.

77
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,300
No need.

78
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,590
I heard

79
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,940
you were punished for what happened yesterday.

80
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,080
It's all my fault.

81
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,690
Give me a chance to make it up.

82
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,020
What good is an apology?

83
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,960
Why don't you reimburse her

84
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,220
deducted bonus first?

85
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,880
Have dinner, right?

86
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll go with you.

87
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,590
Staying here will only complicate things.

88
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,200
Don't worry.

89
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,040
Let's go.

90
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,510
You haven't been back to the campus for a long time, right?

91
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,750
I've never come back

92
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,950
since you graduated.

93
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,310
Didn't you ask me to eat with you?

94
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,530
Isn't it good to revisit an old place?

95
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,560
But things have changed.

96
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,350
Mr. Yan, Manager Shen, here is your food.

97
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,660
Eat.

98
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
It's the grilled meat we used to eat.

99
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll eat then.

100
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
How time flies.

101
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,960
When we first met,

102
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,910
you were only 19.

103
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,510
I was 21.

104
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,960
You're here. Let's go.

105
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,560
What's wrong?

106
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,290
Why are you covering your face?

107
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,160
I had Thai curry shrimps last night.

108
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,290
I was allergic to the mango in the meat.

109
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,680
You're so ugly.

110
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,010
You think I'm ugly, huh?

111
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,710
No!

You're not gonna answer it?

114
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,310
It's from my dad. No need to answer it.

115
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,160
Actually, Mr. Yan never really liked me.

116
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,540
You knew that, right?

117
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,830
So you knew.

118
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,470
Then why did you come to me?

119
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,540
I want to marry you.

120
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,710
I understand my dad.

121
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,690
He's a businessman.

122
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,590
He wants me to marry a lady

123
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,520
from a rich family.

124
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,580
But I don't want to.

125
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,950
Xifan, in this matter,

126
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,180
you can completely ignore what he said.

127
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,450
I'm independent now.

128
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,680
I have my own voice.

129
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,960
He can't decide my life anymore.

130
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,230
My robot company has applied for many patents

131
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,360
and won many awards.

132
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,440
It's been acquired by Zhongyu,

133
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,200
but I retain full control.

134
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,350
I can contend against him.

135
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,280
So?

136
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,230
So he has no right

137
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,630
to object to our marriage.

138
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,320
But I don't want to marry you.

139
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,290
Why?

140
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,400
There's no why.

141
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,560
Because I don't want to.

142
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,470
I don't want to marry you.

143
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,870
Xifan,

144
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,080
I know you are still mad at me.

145
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,350
But I already explained to you.

146
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,440
At that time, I was too busy

147
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,370
and too stressed

148
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,680
to focus on us.

149
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,280
And I'm not saying we should

150
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
get married immediately.

151
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,560
I just...

152
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,350
You just want to get back together,

153
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,230
right?

154
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,400
Yan Heng,

155
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,250
you never care about what I want.

156
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,680
You always ask me to cooperate with you.

157
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,870
Whether it's our breakup

158
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,930
or your sudden appearance this time,

159
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,160
you've never cared about my feelings,

160
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,250
even just a little.

161
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,870
I really don't want to marry you.

162
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,110
And I don't want to see you anymore.

163
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,770
Please don't come to me again!

164
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,470
Xifan.

165
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,470
And you know what?

166
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,320
Since college,

167
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,050
I've never liked grilled meat.

168
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,140
Where's the sachet?

169
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
Why is it gone?

170
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,120
Don't think you're not good.

171
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,050
And don't think you're worthless.

172
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,290
You're just hurt

173
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
by a bad relationship.

174
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,450
The most important thing

175
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,880
is to love yourself and live well.

176
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,660
He Suye.

177
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,740
What's wrong?

178
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,050
Where are you?

179
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,990
I'm on my way home.

180
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,790
I have a headache.

181
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,550
Can you come to take a look at me?

182
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,030
Okay.

183
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,750
Wait for me in the clinic.

184
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,270
Okay.

185
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,560
[TCM Clinic No. 3]

186
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,600
Restless mind.

187
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,450
Unstable qi in your liver.

188
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,170
Stagnant qi in your heart.

189
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,600
Ex-boyfriend trouble?

190
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,750
Go lie down.

191
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,030
I'll give you acupuncture.

192
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,490
Have a good sleep tonight.

193
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,710
Okay.

194
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,740
Hello.

195
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
We're closing.

196
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,630
Are you here for medicine or treatment?

197
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
I'm looking for someone.

198
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,670
Are you feeling better?

199
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Much better.

200
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,030
My head doesn't hurt that much.

201
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,750
Then...

202
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,700
can you tell me

203
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,670
what on earth happened tonight?

204
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,550
He Suye.

205
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,690
I...

206
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,120
It's okay.

207
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,520
Lie down.

208
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Mr. Yan, are you here for treatment?

209
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,380
Let me take your pulse.

210
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,380
It's free.

211
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:37,930
No need.

212
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,090
I'd never seek treatment in a place like this.

213
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,860
I'm here to accompany her.

214
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,850
She's throwing a tantrum at me.

215
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,020
The acupuncture treatment takes 15 minutes.

216
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,220
Mr. Yan, you should

217
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,370
have a seat and wait for her.

218
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,920
15 minutes. I'll wait.

219
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,490
Xifan, I'll be waiting for you outside.

220
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,160
Be patient.

221
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
Patients need peace.

222
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,580
Otherwise,

223
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,960
blood might spurt from the needles.

224
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,640
15 minutes.

225
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,970
It's done, right?

226
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,460
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

227
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,840
She still needs moxibustion.

228
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Why don't you go to the toilet first?

229
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,430
Moxibustion will take more than 20 minutes.

230
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,630
Okay, I'll listen to you.

231
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,440
Mr. Yan, you don't need to go with her.

232
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,390
It's not proper to go to the toilet with a woman.

233
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,970
You're being so nosy.

234
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,860
Dr. He, right?

235
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Let me remind you.

236
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,030
Stop wasting your effort.

237
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,760
She won't fall for your tricks.

238
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,770
You must have pursued her for a long time.

239
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,300
If she fell for your tricks,

240
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,960
she would have been your girlfriend long ago, right?

241
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,690
We were lovers for seven years.

242
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,390
We were about to get married.

243
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,580
I know her too well.

244
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,970
It's just like artemisia capillaris in April.

245
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,050
What does that mean?

246
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,220
Are you cursing me?

247
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,230
No.

248
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,260
You can search it up.

249
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,470
You are just a back-up,

250
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,070
but you sure are trying hard.

251
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,550
That's because you're not good enough.

252
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,710
I'm still in the game.

253
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,040
You won't have a chance.

254
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,060
Really? I thought she dumped you long ago.

255
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,910
Mr. Yan, you still won't leave?

256
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,470
I'm getting off work.

257
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,200
Xifan has left.

258
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,900
Mr. Yan.

259
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,010
Have you seen Shen Xifan?

260
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,030
No.

261
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
Why are you sitting on the ground?

262
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,560
Get up.

263
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,220
Your hands are so cold.

264
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,070
Come on. Put on my coat.

265
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,550
♫The moment I see you, all my worries turn transparent♫

266
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,280
Are you cold?

267
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,680
♫In the silence, the sound of my heartbeat grows clearer♫

268
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,980
♫The entire world reflects in your eyes♫

269
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,970
♫Make a wish, can the snow fall slowly?♫

270
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,980
♫Even if we're destined to meet and miss each other♫

271
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,160
♫Life is finally complete♫

272
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Xifan.

273
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,920
Why can't you let him go?

274
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,190
It's not that I can't let him go.

275
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,980
I'm just mad at my past self.

276
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
No matter what happened in the past,

277
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,650
good or bad,

278
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,010
it's part of who you are.

279
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,270
Accept the past,

280
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,400
and focus on the present and the future.

281
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,620
Besides,

282
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,930
think from this perspective:

283
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,430
without him,

284
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,560
you wouldn't have come to the clinic

285
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
because of insomnia.

286
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,400
Right?

287
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Good.

288
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,440
Stop crying.

289
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Unknowingly,

290
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,800
I've treated you for so long.

291
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,430
You're finally healing.

292
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,680
♫Watching the snow fall, flake by flake♫

293
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,320
♫Slowly melting away my thoughts♫

294
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,080
You're not cold now, right?

295
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,600
♫Smiling, I wave goodbye as you head home♫

296
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
Go back now.

297
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,120
It's a bit cold beside the river.

298
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,710
Don't catch a cold.

299
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,440
♫But I never said those words♫

300
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:56,050
♫Flake by flake, the snow melts♫

301
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,930
♫Love blooms quietly♫

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,070
♫Hold you close with a deep kiss♫

303
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,930
♫White lovers are answering♫

304
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,840
Keep your wrist steady, and press hard.

305
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,310
She's back. Our daughter is back.

306
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,090
You're back.

307
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,130
Why are you back so late?

308
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
I worked overtime today.

309
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,470
Are you hungry?

310
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,360
I made Red Bean Soup with Tangerine Peel.

311
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,220
Do you want me to heat it up for you?

312
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,830
I'm not hungry.

313
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,470
I want to take a shower and go to bed.

314
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,510
That tired?

315
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,250
Why did you work overtime?

316
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
There was a big event?

317
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,360
No.

318
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,960
I just...

319
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,310
met a difficult VIP client.

320
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,070
Who is that difficult?

321
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,040
I think you should go to a TCM physician again.

322
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,210
You don't have to go to He.

323
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,760
You can get another doctor.

324
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,070
Maybe later.

325
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,750
Dad.

326
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,070
Help me hang the keys.

327
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,470
I'm going back to my room.

328
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,160
Do you think she looks weird

329
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,490
whenever we mention He?

330
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
A little.

331
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,000
A little?

332
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,400
It's so obvious.

333
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,200
Shen,

334
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,410
you should resolve the situation

335
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,890
with Mr. Yan as soon as possible.

336
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,920
He keeps looking for you publicly.

337
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,040
It's really not a good look.

338
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,870
After all, gossip is a fearful thing.

339
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,470
In our industry, we're already walking on thin ice.

340
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,510
Every hotel has staff

341
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,620
fired for being involved with guests.

342
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,840
If you're dismissed over something like this,

I saw him last night.

And today, Xifan suddenly asked me

416
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,790
if he came to me.

It's strange.

Did he do something in the hotel?

419
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Once, I saw him

420
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,080
forcing Xifan to meet him.

421
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,760
It was quite a scene.

I heard Xifan got punished because of it.

too much in her personal matters.

435

Besides, she's a smart person.

She's just been a little lost recently.

It's got potential.

485
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,800
It's better than the common research projects
