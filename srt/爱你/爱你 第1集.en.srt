You can't sleep well,

instead of sleeping in bed.

I thought since I couldn't sleep anyway,

I should get up and exercise.

Last night...

21

From 1 a.m. to 3 a.m.,

22

Sleeping pills won't do.

They'll cause damage to your brain.

45

But chronic sleep deprivation will also cause damage to my brain.

No. No.

Ms. Shen, why don't you

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
go see a TCM physician

53

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,520
No.

176
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,110
Then...

177
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,940
Pharmacy decoction it is.

178
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,410
Take this prescription

179
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,450
and pay at the reception desk.

180
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,070
Remember to come again

181
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,130
for a follow-up visit next Saturday.

182
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,850
I need to come again for a follow-up visit?

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,669
Okay.

184
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,120
Thank you then.

185
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
See you next week.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Hello.

187
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,430
Hello.

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,220
Here's the prescription for pharmacy decoction.

189
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,130
Thank you.

190
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,640
Please wait a moment.

191
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,070
Okay.

192
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
How did it go?

193
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,250
Did you see his face?

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,920
I didn't see his face. Sad.

195
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,310
Miss Shen.

196
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
I forgot to remind you.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
The pharmacy closes at 5 p.m.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,830
Pharmacy decoction

199
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,600
takes four hours.

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,160
So,

201
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,590
you can come and collect your medicine

202
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,550
at 2 p.m.

203
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,790
Okay.

204
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,000
Miss Shen.

205
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,280
Our pharmacy closes at 5 p.m.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,650
Pharmacy decoction

207
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,580
takes four hours.

208
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,590
So,

209
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,430
you can come

210
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,090
and collect your medicine at about 2 p.m.

211
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,550
Thank you.

212
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,300
-Take care.
-Thank you.

213
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,670
If you encounter any trouble

214
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,790
at work,

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,500
don't take it to heart.

216
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,730
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

217
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,940
You're going to study abroad?

218
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
You didn't even discuss such an important matter with me.

219
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,450
You've really changed.

220
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
I didn't have time to answer the phone,

221
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,220
so you just stopped talking to me?

222
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,180
Are you going to accuse me of not replying to your messages again?

223
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,470
Shen Xifan.

224
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

225
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,430
You know how busy I am at work.

226
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,430
Can't you be more considerate of me?

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,590
Yan Heng.

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's

229
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
not talk about this today, okay?

230
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,810
We haven't seen each other

231
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,380
for quite a long time.

232
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,650
What are you doing?

233
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,670
Go pay at the information desk later.

234
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,520
-Remember to use your medical insurance.
-Thank you.

235
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:25,950
It's nothing.

236
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,830
Thank you, doctor.

237
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,760
You're welcome.

238
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,520
Go.

239
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,760
Look, it's over there.

240
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,280
Thank you.

241
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,940
Take care.

242
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,390
Okay.

243
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,790
Remember to come and collect it before 5 p.m.

244
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,850
Otherwise, the pharmacy will close.

245
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,920
Dr. He.

246
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,180
Why are you here?

247
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,170
Anything wrong?

248
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,590
I have no appointment at the moment,

249
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,850
so I came out for a walk.

250
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,640
Dr. He.

251
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,310
You seem to be quite free all day.

252
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,510
It's time for me to get off work.

253
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,420
I'm leaving then.

254
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,910
Okay, see you next week.

255
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,590
Time to get off work,

256
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,640
Dr. Sun.

257
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,430
Okay.

258
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,720
Ms. Shen?

259
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,070
Here.

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,710
I got your medicine back for you.

261
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,360
Drink it.

262
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
What's wrong?

263
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,400
It's too bitter.

264
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,310
I don't want to drink it.

265
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,550
Bitter medicine is good for the disease.

266
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,760
Haven't you heard of this saying?

267
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,400
Drink it.

268
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,050
Can I really trust the doctor at my neighborhood clinic?

269
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,190
Suye.

270
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,120
Come and save me.

271
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,130
[Jiangzhou Medical University
Affiliated TCM Hospital]

272
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,790
Dr. He, you're finally here.

273
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,280
Come on.

274
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,470
The patient's family is giving Li Jie a dressing-down.

275
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you good for nothing?

276
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,190
So you're saying,

277
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,520
you have to insert the tube

278
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,640
into his lungs again,

279
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,000
or he'll suffocate to death?

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,470
Do you believe

281
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,590
I'll report it to your director and dean?

282
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,920
That's not what I meant.

283
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:29,640
Dr. He.

284
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,190
Senior He.

285
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,670
Do something.

286
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,310
Calm down.

287
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,070
He can't even breathe now.

288
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,000
Medical record.

289
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,130
Lung cancer.

290
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:44,430
Tongue.

291
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,710
His tongue coating is thick and greasy, and his tongue is red.

292
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,840
Did you use needles?

293
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Li Jie.

294
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:52,920
I did.

295
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,670
I inserted a needle into each of

296
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,310
the three acupoints: Feishu, Neiguan, and Fenglong.

297
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,360
The patient has lung cancer combined with infection,

298
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,360
and his respiratory secretions increased and turned into sputum.

299
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,000
The patient is in poor general condition.

300
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
Sputum is blocking his airways,

301
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,190
causing breathing difficulties for the patient.

302
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,450
Did he cough up sputum?

303
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,240
A little,

304
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,880
but he still couldn't breathe.

305
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,590
So I suggested using a sputum suction machine.

306
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm worried if we delay it any longer...

307
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,550
If I had known that we would have to use a sputum suction machine,

308
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,670
we might as well have gone to a Western hospital.

309
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,280
Why would we have chosen a TCM hospital?

310
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,920
Hey.

311
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,190
What are you waiting for?

312
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,420
The machine is ready, isn't it?

313
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,950
Alright.

314
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,760
Li Jie.

315
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,020
Get ready for cupping.

316
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,310
I said, get ready for cupping.

317
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,760
Okay.

318
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,380
Go get the needle cart.

319
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,870
Okay.

320
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,560
Help the patient up.

321
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,650
Take off his shirt.

322
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,160
Sir.

323
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Are you breathing better now?

324
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
Much better.

325
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,600
Thank you.

326
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,080
Fortunately, you coughed up the sputum.

327
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,320
Please take a rest.

328
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,510
Thank you, Dr. He.

329
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,230
It's all thanks to you, who came here in the middle of the night.

330
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,830
I was almost scared to death.

331
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,470
I thought he was going to be like my dad,

332
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,880
who had difficulty breathing

333
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,280
and suffocated to death.

334
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,120
Dr. Li also did the right thing inserting the needles.

335
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,430
He bought time for us.

336
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,590
He didn't dare to use the sputum suction machine

337
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,630
because the patient is aged.

338
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,810
[The patient needs to be observed for a while longer. I'll be on duty tonight. Don't worry.]

339
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,810
[What happened today is common. Don't take it to heart.]

340
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,130
[Okay, thank you, Suye.]

341
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,750
I wonder if she'll come

342
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,700
next week for the follow-up visit.

343
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,330
Shen Xifan.

344
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Being your boyfriend is too tiring.

345
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,120
You don't care about me at all.

346

You only care about yourself.

347
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,460
Only I can put up with you.

348
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,560
Think about it yourself.

349
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,400
A rice ball,

350
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,000

How much is this soy milk?

352
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,750
I'll have one.

353
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay.

Where are you?

366
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,470
Ms. Liu. I couldn't sleep,

367
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,240
so I came down to buy breakfast.

368
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,670
I don't know why,

369
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,430
but that traditional Chinese medicine didn't work at all.

370
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,990
I couldn't sleep until three o'clock last night.

371
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,670
How about

372
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,320
you throw it away for me?

373
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,780
What a waste that would be.

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,480
Oh my god.

Right.

380
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,430
I was too anxious.

381

Here.

382
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,050
Your breakfast is ready.

Okay, bye.

387
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,500
Dr. He. You just got off the night shift?

388
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,780
I'll have the usual set.

389
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,260
Okay.

390
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,480

Does that girl come here often?

She lives in this neighborhood too.

394
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,540
She comes here to buy breakfast sometimes.

Come again.

399
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,160
Okay.

Here.

Time to take your traditional Chinese medicine.

402
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,600
I don't want to take it.

403
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,750
It's too bitter, and it doesn't work.

404
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,400
Drink it.

405
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,150
Listen.

406
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,360
I ran into that TCM physician downstairs today.

407
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,710
He was also yawning.

408

You want a person with insomnia

409
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,080
to treat another person with insomnia?

410
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,230
Of course it won't work.

411
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,360
I'm not drinking it.

412
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,270
This is traditional Chinese medicine, not poison.

There's rock candy here.

How's Yan been?

415
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,270
Why haven't I heard about him lately?

416
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,710
He recently started a business.

417
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,600
He must be busy.

418
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560

He will bring two assistants with him.

and he'll arrive at our hotel at about 3:30 p.m.

But it should be noted that

Mr. Jiang is allergic to seafood.

when preparing food for him.

is definitely your type.

His face

522
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,710
is so handsome that even a passing ant

523
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,950
would be amazed.

524
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I'm going there again for a follow-up visit this Saturday.

525
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,950
Do you want to join me?

526
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,640
Sure.

Hong'an Gate Clinic]

528

What are you looking at?

529
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,430
The smell of traditional Chinese medicine is terrible.

530
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,600
I hope

531
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,080
the handsomeness of that TCM physician

532
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,750
can make me ignore the taste of traditional Chinese medicine.

533
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,430
Beauty, trust me.

534
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,880
Come on.

The handsome TCM physician?

540
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,400
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,270
I must have made the wrong appointment.

542
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,270
I'm here for a follow-up visit.

543
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,190
So I should

544
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,670
see the doctor I saw last time.

545
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,360
You mean Dr. He?

546
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Yes.

He can't make it today.

549
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,710
I'm here on his behalf.

550
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,710
In that case...

551
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,470
What?

552
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,160
You think my medical skills are not as good as his?

553
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,050
That's nonsense.

554
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,400
Since you're here for a follow-up visit,

Doctor, examine her carefully.

Besides,

I came here to see the handsome guy

and flirt with him.

Do you really think I came here to get TCM treatment?

Did you tell Yan Heng that you were going abroad?

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,030
I told him.

583
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,560
He got really mad because of this.

584
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,670
Since then,

585
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,870
he has seldom replied

586
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,950
to my WeChat messages.

587
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,120
And I never had a chance to say it.

588
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,530
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you.

589
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,950
Are you really happy with him?

590

I’ve been together with Yan Heng for too long.

594

It's been seven whole years.

595
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
The two of us

596
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,710
know each other well,

597
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
and we're familiar with each other.

598
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,360
It's just I don't know why,

599
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,710
but over the past six months,

600
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,160

602
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,020

603
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,400
Did he tell you how many days he'd be away for the business trip?

604
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200

Okay.

610
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,280
He didn't go to the clinic.

What I learned recently is that

688
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,950
when I'm facing

689
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,990
a patient's critical situation alone,

690
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,650
I need to be calm and decisive.

691
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,250
I shouldn't...

692
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:30,990
Alone?

693
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,880
He Suye.

694
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,070
You let an intern

695
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,470
face the critical situation alone?

696
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,360
He was on duty in the hospital that day. I...

697
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,680
Don't tell me any objective reasons.

698
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,530
Right, I left them to you.

699
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,070
It wasn't just to let you teach them theoretical knowledge.

700
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,550
What's more important is practice,

701
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,790
especially front-line practice.

702
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:00,750
Right.

703
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,430
But you can't

704
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
let him handle it alone.

705
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,550
Got it.

706
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,630
I'll be more careful in the future.

707
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,800
Have some wine.

708
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,820
Let's not talk about this now.

709
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,570
Come on.

710
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,770
Let's eat.

711
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Let's eat.

712
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,880
Yesterday, I went to the clinic on your behalf,

713
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,240
and two young ladies came in for a follow-up visit.

714
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,630
When they saw it was me,

715
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,760
they looked

716
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
really disappointed.

717
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,560
So the doctor she saw was you.

718
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,720
One of them is surnamed Shen.

719
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,470
What's her name again...

720
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,760
Shen Xifan.

721
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,990
She has insomnia.

722
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,070
how's her situation this week?

723
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,240
I checked her pulse.

724
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,130
Her liver and kidneys are weak.

725
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:01,990
But

726
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,890
her sleep and complexion have improved.

727
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,070
I adjusted the amount of some ingredients according to your previous prescription

728
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,280
for another week.

729
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,160
That's good.

730
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
In the future, when you have to be absent,

731
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,550
inform the patients in advance.

732
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,350
Don't let them come for nothing.

733
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,640
It's also bad for your medical ethics.

734
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,720
I don't have her contact information.

735
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,320
How should I inform her in advance?

736
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,430
Patients are required to leave their phone numbers when making an appointment.

737
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,760
You can inquire about it at the front desk.

738
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,070
That won't do.

739
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,430
Then when she comes for the follow-up visit next time,

740
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,510
ask for

741
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,510
her phone number.

742
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,280
I like the look

743
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,110
of this girl.

744
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
She's pretty good-looking.

745
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,030
She has good temperament,

746
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,260
and she's quite elegant.

747
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,720
I liked her at first sight.

748
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,680
She's four years younger than you.

749
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,080
You're also suitable for each other in age.

750
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,450
That traditional Chinese medicine didn't work at all.

751
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,110
How about you

752
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,370
throw it away for me?

753
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,800
What a waste that would be.

754
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,330
Oh my god.

755
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,780
Dr. He.

756
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,950
Dr. He.

757
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,040
I'll go there again for another follow-up visit next weekend.

758
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,510
Don't stand me up again.

759
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:35,570
♫No matter how much longer it is in the dark♫

760
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,480
♫Your voice is always gentle♫
