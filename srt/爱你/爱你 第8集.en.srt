00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,870
Sir,

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,590
you're open?

5
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,560
You're off work?

6
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,210
Nice.

7
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,130
Bye-bye.

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,750
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

10
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,940
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

11
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:46,010
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

♫Lololove and sunshine♫

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,360
Do you usually commute by bus?

21
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:20,360
♫Close your eyes, and love will never fade away♫

22
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,080
This bus can

23
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
take me right to the hotel shuttle stop.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,260
It's very convenient.

25
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,280
Let's go have dinner.

26
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,540
What would you like to eat? I'll order it.

27
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,490
How about

28
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,110
we go to my place...

29
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,829
to make medicinal cuisine?

30
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,520
I was just thinking about making it a couple of days ago.

31
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,420
So I already bought all the herbs in advance.

32
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,660
We can eat together.

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,890
What? Is it not okay for you?

34
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,770
Nope.

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,430
It's okay.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's go then.

37
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,030
Come on.

38
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:52,690
Let's go.

39
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,630
Which floor do you live on?

40
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,430
The 5th floor.

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,410
I'm on the 12th.

42
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,690
A higher floor.

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,330
Higher is better.

44
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,770
Yeah.

45
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,560
Yes, it's quite good.

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,630
Nice.

47
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,320
Come in, please.

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,990
Mm.

49
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,230
I don't usually have visitors.

50
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,230
So I only have disposable slippers.

51
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,200
It's okay.

52
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,270
I'll open a pair for you.

53
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,910
Thank you.

54
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,560
Change your shoes first.

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,170
Okay.

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,650
I'll go get you something to drink.

57
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,360
It's five-flavor fruit water.

58
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,750
It replenishes qi and generates body fluids.

59
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,770
You can give it a try.

60
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,540
Thank you.

61
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,600
It's so good.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,390
Right?

63
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
Then drink some more.

64
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,950
Don't just stand there.

65
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,870
Go take a seat.

66
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,890
It's a bit messy. Please don't mind it.

67
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,840
It's okay.

68
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,100
Sit down, please.

69
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm going to put some music on.

70
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,870
Okay.

71
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,730
♫So I wait and wander, but the outcome isn't so bad♫

72
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,360
You can sit for a while.

73
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,070
I'll go make some food.

74
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,130
It won't take long.

75
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,830
Okay.

76
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,190
♫Sparrows gather on the windowsill, sunlight streaming through♫

77
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,130
I'll be right back.

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:59,240

I just came to see if there's anything I can help with.

98
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,990
Can you cook?

99
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,810
♫It became brighter because of you♫

100

Nope.

101

It'll be ready soon.

105
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,080

This medicinal cuisine

114
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,000
is perfect for autumn nourishment.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
You can try it.

116
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,430
Here you are.

117
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,010
Be careful, it's hot.

118
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,580
Thanks.

119
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,890
It smells so good. What did you put in it?

120
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,050
It should be the fragrance of angelica.

121
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,700
Angelica can nourish qi and blood.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,360
It's especially good for you.

123
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,650
Dr. He.

124
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,350
Can I take a picture?

125
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,530
Of course.

126
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,780
Sending it to your friends?

127
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,910
Not really.

128
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,640
"Not really"? What do you mean?

129
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,460
Actually, I came here today

130
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,980
to ask you for some help

131
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,060
with a work thing.

132
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,240
A work thing? What is it?

133
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,980
Our hotel is currently planning a TCM-themed

134
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,490
wellness journey.

135
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,460
Medicinal cuisine is part of it,

136
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,950
so we might need to hire a consultant.

137
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,380
You're the person I thought of.

138
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,980
I wonder if you're available and interested.

139
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,730
If it's just for consulting,

140
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,590
sure,

141
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,610
I can give it a try.

142
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,220
However,

143
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,490
for this consulting work,

144
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,020
do I need to go to your hotel?

145
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,490
It would be best if you could come,

146
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,460
but if you can't,

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,390
online consultation is also fine.

148
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,430
I'm on duty at the TCM hospital from Monday to Friday

149
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,010
and at the TCM clinic on Saturdays.

150
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,970
So I'm only free on Sundays.

151
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,750
Would that work for you?

152
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,810
No problem, we can work around your schedule.

153
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,530
Alright, then I'll give it a try.

154
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,060
Great.

155
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,190
As you know,

156
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,750
I have a full-time job at the TCM hospital.

157
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,080
So,

158
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,250
I need to be cautious about external consulting projects.

159
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,160
Can you show me

160
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,400
your specific plan?

161
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,600
No problem.

162
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,060
I'll send it to you once I wrap up

163
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,200
the proposal drafting.

164
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,420
Rest assured, we are absolutely legitimate.

165
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,020
I didn't say you weren't legitimate.

166
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,470
I'm just being cautious.

167
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,790
However, I have a small suggestion.

168
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,680
We don't recommend using the term "TCM specialty."

169
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,690
We really don't suggest restaurants

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,290
advertise medicinal effects and treatments.

171
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,530
It might cause some

172
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,460
unnecessary troubles and issues.

173
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,440
But going with Chinese herbal wellness is fine.

174
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
Focus on gentle health care.

175
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,650
I got it.

176
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,530
Then, Dr. He, I'm looking forward to working with you.

177
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,890
Same here.

178
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,370
How is it?

179
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,530
It tastes so delicious.

180
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,660
Then have some more.

181
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,770
When I make fish soup,

182
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,030
you can come over and try it.

183
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,490
The one I make has milky soup and tender fish.

184
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
Sure, thank you for inviting me.

185
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,980
You're usually swamped with work,

186
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,240
yet you still learn to cook for yourself?

187
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,100
I do cook for myself when I'm free.

188
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,450
But I also eat at the hospital cafeteria.

189
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,060
Did you start cooking

190
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,260
to improve your diet?

191
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,220
Nope.

192
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,330
The food at our hospital cafeteria is quite good.

193
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,980
And some dishes also have medicinal herbs added.

194
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,930
Quite unique.

195
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,770
Is it unique in flavor

196
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,820
or just unusual?

197
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,440
I'd say it's a unique flavor.

198
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,810
I thought your hospital cafeteria

199
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,610
would be like my college's cafeteria,

200
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,060
both unique and unusual.

201
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's go, I'll walk you home.

202
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,940
Don't bother. It's not that late.

203
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,530
You can go back and rest.

204
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,360
Okay.

205
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,470
Well, bye-bye.

206
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,790
Good night.

207
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,730
Oh, right, Dr. He,

208
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,300
I was supposed to treat you to dinner today

209
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,610
to invite you to be our consultant.

210
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,810
But you ended up cooking for me instead.

211
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,230
What's the big deal?

212
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,900
The formality isn't that important.

213
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,300
What matters is that we both had a good meal.

214
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,580
No, last time it was moxibustion.

215
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,060
And this time you cooked for me.

216
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,460
Next time, I must treat you to a hearty meal.

217
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Well, if it's your treat, I won't hold back.

218
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,490
Good!

219
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,450
See you next time then.

220
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,330
See you around.

221
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

222
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,130
Dr. He and I have reached an agreement.

223
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,530
He can be our consultant.

224
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,510
But he still needs our project proposal

225
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,750
for confirmation.

226
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,230
Nice!

227
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,040
Could you give me a copy of his profile?

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,440
I'll add it to the slides.

229
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,300
I forgot to ask him for it.

230
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,770
I'll send it to you later.

231
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,820
Okay.

232
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,180
The hospital's official website should have this kind of profile, right?

233
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,720
[He Suye]

234
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,400
This ID photo would look a bit out of place on the expert showcase wall.

235
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,630
Are you asleep?

236
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,020
You're fishing for a response again.

237
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,540
Well, looks like you still took the bait.

238
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:05,890
Hello?

239
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:06,890
Hello?

240
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,730
Why are you suddenly calling me?

241
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
I...

242
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,650
I just wanted to ask you

243
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,890
when the proposal will be completed.

244
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,470
I might need to send two graduate students to help.

245
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,670
Is it okay to finish it within this week?

246
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,490
Yes.

247
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,680
Then you don't need to work overtime tonight.

248
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,740
Okay.

249
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,550
I mean...

250
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
You can hit the hay early.

251
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,010
Then I'll

252
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,610
hang up now.

253
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,630
Good night.

254
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,030
Good night.

255
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,570
Didn't expect him to be so professional.

256
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,700
I even thought about changing his prescription before.

257
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,650
Relax, it's okay.

258
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,310
Yes, this acupoint.

259
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,820
Insert the needle.

260
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,470
It's alright, don't be nervous.

261
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,550
It's done.

262
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,860
How do you feel? Still feel like vomiting?

263
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,220
I'm fine now.

264
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,380
No worries.

265
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,900
Vomiting is one of the most common

266
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,770
side effects after chemotherapy.

267
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,140
In terms of TCM,

268
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,330
it's a symptom of stomach disharmony and qi reversal.

269
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:40,940
As for constipation,

270
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,000
it's a side effect of the antiemetic.

271
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,180
So these two side effects

272
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,980
usually occur simultaneously.

273
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,570
Before the next chemotherapy session,

274
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,730
you can have her drink some Pinellia Soothing Decoction

275
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,140
to avoid these side effects.

276
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,090
Okay, I got it.

277
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,730
Come here and learn this.

278
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,170
If the patient still feels nauseous at other times,

279
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,960
you can gently press on the second metacarpal bone

280
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
of the right hand.

281
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,920
Feeling a bit sore and swollen, right?

282
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,510
It's normal to feel so.

283
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,810
Press for about a minute,

284
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,570
and it should relieve the symptoms.

285
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,290
Okay, I got it.

286
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,350
Thank you, doctor.

287
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,380
I feel much better now.

288
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,640
Alright, you can get some rest now.

289
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,170
I'll have a doctor come to remove the needle later.

290
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,130
Thank you.

291
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,010
It's not a busy day today.

292
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,430
The food's a bit cold.

293
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,820
Do you want some shrimp?

294
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,620
I'll have one.

295
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,210
Here.

296
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
What dish is this?

297
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,330
I think it's a bit too salty.

298
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,120
Li Jie.

299
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,330
This doesn't taste good.

300
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:56,790
Really?

301
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,650
Li Jie!

302
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,530
This kid,

303
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,660
why is he always clinging to Senior He?

304
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,180
Is that so?

305
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,730
Try one.

306
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,980
I didn't notice it.

307
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,780
I'll have one.

308
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,420
Alright, alright.

309
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,150
Stop playing and eat your meal.

310
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,660
Come on, eat up.

311
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,980
Can I have some of yours?

312
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,440
Your chicken drumstick looks so delicious.

313
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,570
No, you have chemotherapy in a couple of days.

314
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,630
You should be careful with your diet.

315
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,770
As I told you before,

316
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,140
the food in this staff cafeteria

317
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,690
isn't even as good as your own meals.

318
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,620
Yet you insisted on coming with me.

319
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,900
My mom has to work.

320
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,460
I don't want her to come all the way here

321
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,660
just to bring me food.

322
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,850
So I'll just make do with this.

323
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,140
Make do with this?

324
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,810
I told you to stay in the ward.

325
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,750
Why do you have to follow me every day?

326
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,680
It's not that I like following you.

327
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,050
You're the only one I'm familiar with in this hospital.

328
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,850
That's right.

329
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,420
After all,

330
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,320
besides my mom,

331
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,480
you're the only one who's seen my butt.

332
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,410
Well,

333
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,220
all those nurses and doctors who helped

334
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,270
deliver you all saw your butt, didn't they?

335
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,700
And also,

336
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,590
hasn't your dad seen your butt too?

337
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,720
I don't have a father.

338
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,650
He died when I was in kindergarten.

339
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,990
I think you're quite like my dad.

340
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,830
That's why I'm following you.

341
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,650
You sweet-talker.

342
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,590
Alright, eat some more at lunch.

343
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,250
Later this afternoon, be a good boy

344
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,950
and stay in the ward to do your homework.

345
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,610
Don't run around, you hear me?

346
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,220
Can I ask you about the questions I can't solve?

347
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,250
Sure, I'm open for appointments this afternoon.

348
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,850
You can make an appointment.

349
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,290
The appointment fee is 20 yuan.

350
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,120
Spending 20 yuan to have you help me with my homework

351
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,310
is not worthwhile!

352
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,250
So you know it's expensive. Then don't run around

353
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,110
and do your homework by yourself.

354
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,490
Eat more vegetables.

355
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,620
Don't just eat rice.

356
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,130
Let's eat them together.

357
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,820
Vegetables are nutritious.

358
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,310
If it's not enough, I'll help you get some more.

359
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,430
What's wrong?

360
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,320
No,

361
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,380
nothing.

362
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,110
This afternoon, Qiu Tian and I will be going back to school.

363
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,510
We need to modify the NSFC bidding document

364
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,510
and organize the new breast cancer cases.

365
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,640
Are you two joining the doctor's consultations this afternoon?

366
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
You're already revising?

367
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
When on earth will you finish your draft?

368
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Soon, soon.

369
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,800
You'd better hurry up.

370
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,420
Submission's the day after tomorrow.

371
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,380
I know!

372
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,780
I'll write it right away.

373
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,180
The person in charge of the tour group

374
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,700
has reviewed the TCM wellness tour proposal.

375
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,730
They also find it feasible.

376
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,990
We can proceed with it.

377
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,290
There might be a few tweaks

378
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,980
but no major changes.

379
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,620
Manager Lin will be responsible for communication and follow-up.

380
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,680
Manager Shen will handle housekeeping and reception.

381
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,140
Manager Xu will be in charge of food and beverage.

382
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,250
You can start contacting the suppliers

383
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,330
for ingredients and medicinal herbs.

384
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,190
One more thing.

385
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,130
Manager Shen.

386
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,030
You need to get Dr. He to sign the consultant contract.

387
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,800
Don't worry,

388
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,050
I've already sent him the standard contract.

389
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,730
He's also good with the consulting fee.

390
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,330
There are just some specific details to be adjusted.

391
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,800
I'll hit up the legal team later.

392
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,190
We'll try to get him to sign the contract this week.

393
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,360
So he can start working with us this Sunday.

394
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,940
Alright.

395
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,770
Since you're more familiar with Dr. He,

396
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,140
the following contract signing

397
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,200
will be left to you.

398
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,730
Okay.

399
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,140
Then you guys communicate internally about this.

400
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,510
I'm going to have lunch now.

401
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,500
Is this Dr. He

402
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,120
single and open to pursuers?

403
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,700
He's single.

404
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:22,810
But...

405
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,380
Then introduce him to me.

406
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,610
Let's keep the best within ourselves!

407
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,810
If it's not okay to pursue Dr. He,

408
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,980
what about his relatives,

409
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,830
friends,

410
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,350
or colleagues?

411
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,570
I'm good with any of them.

412
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,500
Could you introduce someone to me?

413
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,530
I didn't say anything.

414
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,490
Manager Shen, I think your luck in love

415
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,140
is so good.

416
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,960
Look at this Dr. He's outstanding appearance.

417
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Oh, and her ex-boyfriend is handsome and rich!

418
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,730
Don't you know her ex-boyfriend is dead?

419
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,730
Um,

420
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,230
if there are no other questions, let's wrap it up here.

421
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,610
Keep in touch for any new updates.

422
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:12,260
Alright.

423
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,220
Hey, are you available?

424
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,880
I'd like to talk to you about the herb suppliers.

425
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,450
Is that necessary?

426
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,310
We can just ask that TCM consultant when he joins us.

427
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,490
Has Zhang Huming arrived?

428
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,520
Little one.

429
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,730
Your pulse is much steadier this time compared to the last.

430
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,530
Are you still coughing up phlegm?

431
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,330
Not anymore.

432
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,980
I'm not short of breath at night either.

433
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,810
Good.

434
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,510
No other discomforts?

435
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,770
I feel lighter overall,

436
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,570
but sometimes when I'm working,

437
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,250
I get a tight chest

438
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,130
and still a bit out of breath.

439
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,590
That's normal.

440
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,010
After lung cancer surgery,

441
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,540
the lung function will be somewhat affected.

442
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,180
Make sure to work out regularly

443
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,420
and don't overexert yourself.

444
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,010
You'll recover slowly

445
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,070
from this illness.

446
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,490
The medicine I prescribed for you last month,

447
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,920
keep taking it for another month.

448
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,140
Have your local hospital copy the prescription for you.

449
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,600
It'll be cheaper this way.

450
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
That's great!

451
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,810
Thank you, Dr. He.

452
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,470
No problem.

453
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,700
Dr. He,

454
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,030
is this your child?

455
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,180
Um...

456
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,850
He's just one of my young patients.

457
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,850
His parent is busy, so she let him come to have fun here.

458
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,910
I thought...

459
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,230
Dr. He, just one word to summarize your character—

460
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,030
trustworthy!

461
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,530
Well, I'll leave then.

462
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,050
Okay...

463
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,620
Goodbye.

464
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,660
Stay in a good mood!

465
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,380
Okay, okay. Thank you!

466
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,040
Zhao Ze.

467
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,990
You're about to have the next chemotherapy session.

468
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,180
Take good care of yourself

469
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,320
and don't run around.

470
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,430
I'm bored.

471
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,490
Bored?

472
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,600
Then go back to do your homework.

473
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,570
Don't end up at the bottom of your grade when you return to school.

474
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,900
It'll be embarrassing.

475
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,110
Alright, go back now.

476
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,360
Don't wander around.

477
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,260
Don't run around like that again next time.

478
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,650
Sorry.

479
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,250
You came for me?

480
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,390
I'd like to have a chat with you.

481
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,640
About what?

482
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,670
You shouldn't always be following Dr. He.

483
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,290
And don't say anything weird.

484
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,900
What did I say?

485
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,890
You said he's like your dad.

486
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
He's a young doctor.

487
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,580
And he's single now.

488
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,420
What you said can easily lead to misunderstandings.

489
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,850
It's not good for his reputation

490
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,330
and career.

491
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,980
I said "like"

492
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,050
but not "is."

493
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,210
Anyway, you're just a kid. You don't understand.

494
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,810
You can't say random things like that anymore.

495
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
Do you like him?

496
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,840
D-Don't talk nonsense.

497
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,320
He's like a teacher to me.

498
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,310
Then why do you care so much?

499
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,250
Since your situation is urgent,

500
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,250
give me your health insurance card. I'll help you process it.

501
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,460
Thank you, doctor.

502
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,220
It's my duty.

503
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,430
Just a moment.

504
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,750
Li, please help me mark this patient's case as "urgent."

505
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,250
How many times has this happened this month?

506
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,090
Remember to have patients

507
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,570
make online appointments in advance from now on.

508
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,040
Okay.

509
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,860
Thank you for your help, Li.

510
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:05,810
All settled.

511
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,720
Thank you, doctor.

512
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,850
It's part of my job.

513
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,860
Were it not for your help,

514
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,480
I wouldn't know how to do it.

515
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,090
Come meet me right after your checkup.

516
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,550
I'll wait for the results before I clock out.

517
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,930
Thank you, Dr. He.

518
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,730
Thank you.

519
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,530
It's nothing.

520
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,620
TCM usually considers chemotherapy as a medicinal toxin.

521
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,490
The medicinal toxin in the stomach

522
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,750
damages its normal digestive function.

523
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,920
In this case, stomach qi reverses, causing vomiting.

524
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,540
Acupuncture can be used to alleviate this.

525
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,010
Acupoints can include Zhongwan, Gongsun,

526
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,420
Neiguan, Hegu, and Zusanli.

527
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,540
The reducing method can relieve the patient's symptoms.

528
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,660
You should learn to use both TCM and Western theories

529
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,810
to analyze and explain,

530
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,340
and thus solve practical clinical problems.

531
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,050
Are you alright?

532
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm fine.

533
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,710
It's always like this after chemotherapy.

534
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,220
I'm used to it. Let's begin.

535
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,330
You'll feel better soon.

536
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,260
We're starting.

537
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,840
Good.

538
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,090
Besides vomiting, are you also having diarrhea?

539
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,940
Just once.

540
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,700
Any blood in the stool?

541
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,490
No.

542
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,490
You even know that?

543
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
Quite professional.

544
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,950
How's your appetite? Do you want to eat?

545
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,360
You just mentioned blood in stool,

546
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,990
so I feel like I shouldn't say I want to eat.

547
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,140
Alright, just rest well then.

548
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,900
Get some good rest.

549
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,700
Be good.

550
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,570
I've prescribed some medicine for him.

551
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,900
Send it to him later.

552
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,510
Let me know if you have any problems.

553
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,670
Dr. He.

554
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,660
I prescribed some medicine for him.

555
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,810
It's for detoxifying and nourishing the spleen and kidneys.

556
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,770
It can go with chemotherapy

557
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,070
and help him expel toxins from his body quickly,

558
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,370
while also replenishing qi and blood.

559
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,100
He can recover faster this way.

560
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,200
Okay, thank you, Dr. He.

561
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,220
Don't worry.

562
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,810
His chemotherapy is showing good results.

563
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,330
You two can go for lunch now.

564
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,090
Who's coming with me for consultations this afternoon?

565
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,910
I'll go.

566
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:42,930
Hello?

567
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,090
Hello?

568
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,770
Dr. He, are you available now?

569
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,290
I have something to tell you.

570
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,220
Yeah, go ahead.

571
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,860
I've sent the clean version

572
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,380
of the contract to your email.

573
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,620
Please check it out.

574
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,530
If everything looks good,

575
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,570
please snap photos of both sides of your ID card

576
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,900
and send them to me.

577
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,240
I need to include them in the contract.

578
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,570
Then I can get it stamped by the legal team.

579
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,310
Alright, I'll check the mail.

580
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,700
Dr. He,

581
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,680
are you busy today?

582
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,510
How about I go to your hospital for your signature?

583
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:20,240
♫Love love love love, is right in front of me♫

584
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,290
This way,

585
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:16,050
we can finish signing today,

586
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,380
and I can apply for your consultant fee this afternoon.

587
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,180
You can start working with us this Sunday then.

588
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
Otherwise,

589
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:28,610
♫Ooh love, ooh love, I've seen your face♫

590
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,860
if it gets pushed to next week,

591
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,330
we might be running short of time.

592
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,290
Okay, you can come over anytime.

593
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,570
Is it okay if I go meet you around 11:30 a.m.?

594
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:36,430
♫Love love love love, is talking right at me♫

595
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,120
No problem.

596
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,290
See you then.

597
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:43,680
♫Loving you, loving you, is the best thing I'll ever do♫

598
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,850
See you later.

599
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,150
I need any one of you to go with me this afternoon.

600
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,160
Kexin,

601
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,290
don't you think

602
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,530
Suye has been in an unusually good mood lately?

603
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,250
Yeah...

604
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,530
It's like

605
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,810
a rare romantic vibe.

606
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,199
Let's go.

607
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,820
He's so chill about it.

608
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,929
He didn't even add a watermark.

609
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,850
[Only for the consultant contract with Gunan Huating Hotel. It's invalid for any other use.]

610
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,930
You're here.

611
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,490
Have you been waiting long?

612
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,490
Not really.

613
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,430
It's just rare for me to skip work.

614
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,480
I'm extraordinarily happy today.

615
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
When I'm happy, I tend to get sleepy.

616
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,450
Get sleepy?

617
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,010
Come on,

618
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,650
follow me.

619
00:35:59,170 --> 00:35:59,680
Come on!

620
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,160
Look, this is the five-flavor fruit.

621
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,580
The one I made tea with for you last time.

622
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,340
So it's these red berries.

623
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,050
Is it also a kind of medicine?

624
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,850
That's right.

625
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,960
What are you doing?

626
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:24,820
Try it.

627
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,690
Dr. He, even children know

628
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,580
we should protect public plants and trees.

629
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,970
Yet you just picked the fruit straight off.

630
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,530
Just one bunch, it's fine.

631
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,760
Try it.

632
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,210
This thing...

633
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,790
Can we eat it directly?

634
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,710
Of course.

635
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,220
Give it a try.

636
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,860
Chew the pit as well.

637
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,610
It tastes awful!

638
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,650
What is that?

639
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,490
The inside

640
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,530
tastes like the Sichuan pepper,

641
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,380
with a hint of bitterness and saltiness.

642
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,590
The sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and spicy are the five flavors of five-flavor fruit.

643
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,470
How is it? Does it wake you up?

644
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,140
You're terrible...

645
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,570
I saw you getting drowsy!

646
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,020
This works better than coffee.

647
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,910
Thank you.

648
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,490
Have some more.

649
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:20,980
No...

650
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,110
It tastes terrible.

651
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,520
Come on, have a bit more.

652
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,650
Here you are, the contract.

653
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,740
The hotel has stamped it.

654
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,800
You can sign it now.

655
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,380
You sound like

656
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,210
you're ordering me to sign some kind of slave contract.

657
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,050
Then don't sign it. Give it to me.

658
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,170
I'll sign it...

659
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,530
If I don't sign,

660
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,300
wouldn't you have been

661
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,500
beguiled into eating the five-flavor fruit for nothing?

662
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,530
You're right.

663
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,460
Alright.

664
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,530
Looking forward to working with you.

665
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,930
Glad to work with you too.

666
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,950
Are you in a hurry to leave?

667
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,650
No.

668
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,830
I just need to file the contract when I get back.

669
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,090
I've also already applied

670
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,090
for the payment request in advance.

671
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,150
How about chilling here with me for a while?

672
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,570
Okay.

673
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,320
Aren't you busy now?

674
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,090
I just finished doing my rounds.

675
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,010
I'm seeing patients only in the afternoon.

676
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm free now.

677
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:15,780
Okay.

678
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,460
I really like it here.

679
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,440
I found it really cozy when I came last time.

680
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,900
Yes,

681
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,990
there are many plants around.

682
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,190
It's especially easy

683
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,180
to get drowsy

684
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,990
and doze off.

685
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:59,280
♫Waking up from my dream, I'm lost in my emotions♫

686
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:06,170
♫Continuous gloom, my failures, hard to let go♫

687
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:15,010
♫But love comes with hurt; I'm a fool, never able to figure it out♫

688
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:22,410
♫Even if you don't give me an answer about the future♫

689
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,650
♫It became brighter because of you♫

690
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,710
♫The world suddenly became so cute♫

691
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,450
♫Maybe I'm too slow to understand♫

692
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,550
♫I can't confess my passionate love to you♫

693
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,420
♫Love is an admiration for beauty♫

694
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:46,340
♫I've decided to only love you♫

695
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,370
♫My foolishness♫

696
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,230
♫My sincerity♫

697
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,840
♫Only for one person♫

698
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:59,480
♫Because of you, even my smile brightens up♫

699
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,630
My call.

700
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,630
Hello?

701
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,450
Senior He, can you come back to the department now?

702
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,140
Is something up?

703
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,500
There's an X-ray we're not sure about.

704
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,130
I see.

705
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,300
Well, I have something urgent to handle.

706
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,230
I need to go back.

707
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,890
It's okay. Just go ahead.

708
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,690
I'll also be heading back to the hotel soon.

709
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,900
Okay, see you around.

710
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,070
Bye-bye.

711
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,630
Bye-bye.

712
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,830
[Oncology]

713
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,460
Hello.

714
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,780
Hello.

715
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,500
We don't start consultations until 1:30 p.m. here.

716
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,860
I'm not here for a consultation.

717
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,120
I'm here to meet Dr. He.

718
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,050
For what?

719
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,600
I have something to give him.

720
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,030
He should be in the inpatient department upstairs right now.

721
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,070
Which floor is the inpatient department on?

722
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,680
8th floor.

723
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:02,940
Okay, thank you.

724
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,530
If you have anything for him, you can give it to me.

725
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,190
I'll help you pass it on to him.

726
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,820
It's okay. It's something quite important.

727
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,920
I'll go send it myself.

728
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,520
Thank you.

729
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,100
-Dr. He...
-Dad!

730
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,920
Dad!

731
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,720
Why are you running so fast?

732
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,670
Where have you been for fun?

733
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,830
The toy store.

734
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,460
Join me for consultations this afternoon.

735
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,860
Go wash your hands first.

736
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,980
Dad...

737
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,820
Dad...
