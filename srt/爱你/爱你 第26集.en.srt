Why did you come back later than me today?

7

Let me tie it for you.

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,790
It's not.

32
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,159
It's good that it's not visible.

33
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,640
This way, Ms. Shen won't find out about it.

34
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,230
Right.

37
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,770
A week.

38
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,670
Then take Ms. Shen out more this week.

39
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm worried she'll be scared if she finds out.

40
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes.

41

42

You mean the pathology report?

Everything will be certain by then.

Okay.

62

We'll see ourselves out.

69
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,980
Give me the bags.

70
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,580
Okay.

71
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,000
If you feel any discomfort, Mrs. Shen,

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,140
let me know immediately.

It's no problem.

75
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,600
By the way, Ms. Shen,

76
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,470
Your mother's company arranged for

77
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,000
a training in the neighboring city tomorrow.

78
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,210
I rescheduled my classes for two days

79

80

Thank you. We'll be leaving now.

Bye-bye.

Take it slow.

83
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,790
I'm at the hospital. Let's meet.

84
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,760
Are the physical examination results out?

85
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
It's not that fast.

86
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,050
But the doctor said everything looks healthy.

87
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,750
He Suye.

88
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,100

89
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,200

90
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
It's nothing.

91
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Why are you here?

92
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,140
I was applying for my visa nearby.

93
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,270
I realized it's quite close to the hospital,

94
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,490
so I came to wait for you to get off work.

95
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,160
My mom...

96
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,110
Is she sick?

97
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,890
Yes.

98
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,590
What's her disease?

99
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,380
Breast cancer.

100
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,280
Breast tumor.

101
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,400
Malignant.

102
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,110
When did they find out?

103
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,880
Four days ago.

104
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,410
So they lied to me about going on a business trip

105
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,900
when they actually came to the hospital.

106
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,500
What stage is her cancer at now?

107
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,480
The removal surgery has been done.

108
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,920
When...

109
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,790
When the pathology report comes out,

110
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,720
we'll arrange the treatment plan.

111
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,190
This.

112
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,310
This is the result of the intraoperative rapid pathology.

113
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,400
The tumor is not big,

114
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,260
and there's no sign of metastasis or spread for now.

115
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,120
Actually, the situation is quite optimistic.

-Don't worry.
-Soâ€¦

Does she still need to do chemo?

119
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,890
It's such a big deal.

120
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,430
You...

121
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,370
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

122
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,520
Before the removal surgery,

123
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,430
we couldn't be sure if it was a malignant tumor.

124
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
We didn't want you to be worried,

125

Well, do you know where Xifan is now?

She's with me.

You should trust Dr. He.

He's a professional.

149
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,800
Since he said your mom's tumor isn't serious

150
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,950
and there shouldn't be a problem,

151
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,270
it must be reliable.

What are your plans now?

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,740
I'll leave the professional matters to He Suye.

I'll talk to him tonight.

157
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,670
The timing is good. You've just completed your resignation process,

00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,130
so you can focus on keeping your mom company.

Have a good chat, Sweetie.

160
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,710
Mrs. Shen had previously asked me

161
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,980
to not tell you anything until the pathology report

162
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,470
came out.

163
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,080
As a doctor,

164
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,420
I have the responsibility to keep my patients' information confidential.

165
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,680
This is also out of respect for Mrs. Shen.

166
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,890
But what you said is also right.

167

I've experienced my mom's battle with cancer and her passing.

168

I know how lost the patients' children can be

Even though there was nothing I could do,

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,570
fearing I might suddenly lose her.

174
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,320
So,

175
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,140
it's my fault for not taking good care of your feelings.

176
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,150
I'm sorry.

177
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm also at fault.

178
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,990
I got too emotional at the time,

179
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,080
and I said so many harsh things.

180
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,090
He Suye.

181
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,880
I didn't do it on purpose.

182
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,670
I'm sorry.

183
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,750
It's okay.

184
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,820
Mrs. Shen will be fine.

185
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,710
Both of you are my family,

186
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,830
and also my responsibility.

187
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,580
I'll definitely take good care of Mrs. Shen.

188
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,950
It's alright now.

189
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm sorry.

190
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,460
Be careful.

191
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,640
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

192
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,930
Mrs. Shen's condition

193
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,160
is quite optimistic.

194
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,560
When you get home,

195
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,400
tell Mr. and Mrs. Shen to relax.

196
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,960
Everything will be okay.

197
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,830
I'll go up now.

198
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,750
It's okay.

199
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,210
Don't overthink it.

200
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,640
I'll be going then.

201
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,320
Go ahead.

202
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,630
Good night.

203
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,290
Good night.

204
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,600
Let me try it.

205
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,080
Is it drinkable now?

206
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
The temperature is perfect.

207
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,800
Come on, help me up.

208
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,530
Can you do it?

209
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,270
Help me up.

210
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,150
Be careful.

211
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,510
Quick, hide it.

212
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,270
I'm back.

213
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,730
Why are you back so late?

214
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,240
You went on a date with He?

215
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,740
Yes, I did.

216
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,560
Take your medicine. It's getting cold.

217
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,430
At least there's...

218
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,230
I'll drink it.

219
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,520
Alright, put it down.

220
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,570
This isn't even your medicine.

221
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,430
It...

222
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,560
It's my medicine.

223
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,430
What's wrong with you?

224
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,160
You must have taken the wrong one.

225
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,560
This is... This is my medicine.

226
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,120
It's just...

227
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,400
I went to the hospital today to see He Suye,

228
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,470
and I saw you two.

229
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,710
Ah, you...

230
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,690
So you know?

231
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,560
He Suye told me that

232
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,080
your condition is quite optimistic.

233
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,200
Just leave the professional matters to him.

234
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,920
Let's just cooperate, okay?

235
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,640
It's alright.

236
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,260
You've had the surgery?

237
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,520
Does the wound hurt?

238
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,320
It doesn't.

239
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,280
Not even a bit.

240
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,950
Where is it?

241
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,360
It's right here.

242
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,640
It's in here.

243
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,950
You can't even see it.

244
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,240
A drainage bag?

245
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,710
He said wearing this drainage bag

246
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,360
is to prevent fluid accumulation and infection.

247
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Yes, right.

248
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,360
It helps the wound heal faster.

249
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,330
As long as it heals fast.

250
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,030
It's okay.

251
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,910
Take your medicine.

252
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,920
Right.

253
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,400
Or it'll get cold.

254
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,670
Be careful.

255
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,510
It must be bitter.

256
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,100
-Take it slow.
-Slowly.

257
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,040
It's really bitter.

258
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,540
No wonder you were unwilling to drink it before.

259
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,890
Let me check your tongue coating.

260
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,880
Good, good.

261
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,160
It looks good.

262
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,870
Do you have the prescription that Suye gave you last time?

263
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,560
Yes, it's in my phone.

264
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,640
Look.

265
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:54,250
Okay.

266
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Let me see.

267
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,080
Not bad.

268
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,710
It promotes blood circulation, relieves pain,

269
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,800
replenishes qi, and nourishes blood.

270
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,670
Take the medicine on time every day.

271
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,080
Move around when you're feeling well.

272
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,360
Keep your spirits up.

273
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,120
That should be good.

274
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,080
Okay.

275
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,800
There's no problem.

276
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,080
It's fine. Don't be nervous.

277
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,430
I understand.

278
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,780
This period of waiting for the pathology results

279
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,080
is always agonizing.

280
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,230
Don't worry.

281
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,920
With Suye and I here,

282
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,020
you'll definitely get through this tough time.

283
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,190
Thank you, and thank you to Suye as well.

284
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,130
Please, don't mention it.

285
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,600
My daughter is gone.

286
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,230
Now my grandson, Suye, is the only family

287
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,990
by my side.

288
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,190
Since fate brought him and Shen together,

289
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,840
I should see you

290
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,460
as my family.

291
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,600
Of course,

292
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,470
As a family,

293
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,030
we're supposed to take care of each other

294
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,830
and share each other's burdens.

295
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,950
I

296
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,840
will teach you a few moves

297
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,920
that can not only

298
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,120
strengthen your body,

299
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,670
but also help dispel stagnant energy

300
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,470
and relieve stress.

301
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,470
Okay. Okay.

302
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,430
Can you get up?

303
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,480
Mr. Shen, this is mainly for you to learn.

304
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,740
Once you learn it well,

305
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,190
you can teach Ms. Liu.

306
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,250
Alright, alright.

307
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,880
Cross your hands.

308
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,710
Cross them.

309
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,210
Place them in front of the Danzhong acupoint.

310
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,020
Danzhong?

311
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,640
The Danzhong acupoint is between the breasts.

312
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,390
That's right.

313
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,430
Flip your wrists

314
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,430
back and forth to tap the Danzhong acupoint.

315
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,840
Look.

316
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,740
Slower.

317
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,670
It's okay.

318
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,530
See, you're using too much force.

319
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,510
It hurts a bit.

320
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,160
50 times a set.

321
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,310
It can help dispel stagnant energy and relieve stress.

322
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,400
I want to study abroad

323
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,320
in Switzerland

324
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,950
for a master's degree in hotel management.

325
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,080
I want to go out and see the world,

326
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,670
and further my studies abroad.

327
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:25,270
I think you should go out and explore the world.

328
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,230
What if it turns out to be everything you hoped for?

329
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,320
This time, I plan to

330
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,560
apply to the top three universities in the world.

331
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
It's very challenging,

332
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,330
but I still want to give it a try.

333
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,510
Okay.

334
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,950
You're an adult now.

335
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,560
We respect your choice.

336
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,230
Dinner is ready.

337
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,080
Come on.

338
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:23,990
Let's eat.

339
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,490
The fish today is especially good.

340
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,080
Ms. Liu, eat more.

341
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,640
You've lost weight these past few days.

342
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,850
Just eat your own food and don't worry about me.

343
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,000
Right, Mrs. Shen. You should eat more,

344
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,160
so your body can replenish its energy.

345
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,030
Have some more fish.

346
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,640
It's high in protein.

347
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,400
Alright, alright, everyone just eat your own food.

348
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,470
Don't worry about me.

349
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,360
Here, let me check for bones.

350
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,840
The fish today

351
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,360
is steamed really well.

352
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
I'll treat you all to a meal outside some other day.

353
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,230
The restaurant's in a small alley by the lake,

354
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,270
and its dishes are light in flavor overall.

355
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,320
The fish there

356
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,800
is incredibly tender.

357
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,240
It's perfect for Ms. Liu to eat now.

358
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,000
Yes.

359
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,600
There are no bones. Go ahead and eat.

360
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,270
How about I learn to cook too?

361
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,670
I just quit my job,

362
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,950
and I have nothing much to do at home.

363
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:12,840
This way, I can let Ms. Liu try my cooking.

364
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,880
That's a good idea.

365
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,750
This way, when you go study abroad,

366
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,350
you can cook for yourself.

367
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,100
Speaking of studying abroad,

368
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,870
Shen, how's your visa application going?

369
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,920
Suye said you're not leaving until October?

370
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,120
Yes.

371
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,360
I've already submitted my visa application.

372
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,160
I'm waiting for the results now.

373
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,560
Learning to cook is good.

374
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,910
Foreign food doesn't satisfy Chinese appetites.

375
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,050
Learn to cook while you can.

376
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,510
It's a win-win situation.

377
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,880
Right. When you are abroad,

378
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Mr. Shen and I won't be there to cook for you anymore.

379
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
Are you just going to eat bread,

380
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,580
sandwiches, and such?

381
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,380
Alright, I'll start learning this week.

382
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,530
If I don't learn well, I'll blame you.

383
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,760
Okay.

384
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,950
Have some soup first.

385
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,250
Go ahead and eat.

386
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,720
Is it too hot?

387
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,750
Dr. He.

388
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,230
Ms. Liu's test results are out.

389
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,430
I'll have Gu Ping bring them down to you.

390
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Senior He.

391
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,920
Here's Ms. Liu's pathology report.

392
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,990
Okay, thank you.

393
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,610
Luminal A (Type A breast cancer).

394
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,470
He.

395
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,230
The result of this pathology report should be considered good,

396
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,920
right?

397
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,840
Yes.

398
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,300
Mrs. Shen, it's an early-stage tumor.

399
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,120
And based on the molecular subtype,

400
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,030
the prognosis is very good.

401
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,430
There's no need to worry.

402
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,840
Really?

403
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,640
Yes.

404
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,990
We've arranged two treatment plans for you.

405
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,750
One is a 15-day radiotherapy course,

406
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,600
and the other is endocrine therapy.

407
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,920
For the 15-day radiotherapy,

408
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,800
it's five times a week,

409
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
for three consecutive weeks.

410
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,710
The endocrine therapy will have a longer cycle,

411
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:18,970
requiring five years.

412
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,920
But the advantage of this treatment plan is

413
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,990
you don't need to be hospitalized.

414
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,120
You can go home to rest after each radiotherapy session.

415
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,490
That would be great.

416
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,980
I can just stay at home.

417
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,420
Yes.

418
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,490
With this treatment plan,

419
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,670
I'm confident that

420
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,880
the five-year survival rate

421
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,670
can reach over 95%.

422
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,190
So it's not 100%?

423
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
There's no treatment plan

424
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,190
that can guarantee 100% survival rate.

425
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,360
95%

426
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,950
is already very, very high.

427
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,510
I understand. I understand.

428
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,710
It's like a student taking an exam.

429
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,120
Ms. Liu, in this big test of life,

430
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,920
you've scored 95 points.

431
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,230
It's very high, right, He?

432
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,400
Exactly.

433
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,580
It's very high.

434
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,150
Mrs. Shen, during the treatment,

435
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,590
there will inevitably be some adverse reactions and side effects.

436
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,150
If you feel any discomfort,

437
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,360
you must let me know.

438
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,110
I can use TCM methods

439
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,639
to help alleviate these side effects for you.

440
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,949
I'll do as you say.

441
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,530
Alright, we can relax now.

442
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,650
We have He here to take care of things.

443
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,860
It's okay now.

444
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,429
It was really frightening.

445
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,699
Alright. We can feel at ease now.

446
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,469
He.

447
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,800
He.

448
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,630
Mrs. Shen.

449
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,840
I'll take you to the radiotherapy clinic.

450
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,770
The doctor might ask you about your medical history,

451
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,469
perform a physical examination,

452
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,110
and review your previous

453
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,510
CT scan reports and such.

454
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,710
You just need to sign,

455
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,000
and then we can start the radiotherapy.

456
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,550
Which way?

457
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,480
It's just ahead.

458
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,680
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

459
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,620
Let's go.

460
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,320
Come on, Mom.

461
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:29,920
Thank you.

462
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,650
Have a seat.

463
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,960
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

464
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,470
I'm okay. I just want some water.

465
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,330
You want water?

466
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,860
Sit down. I'll get it.

467
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,030
Drink slowly.

468
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:57,870
It's okay.

469
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,840
Don't worry.

470
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,100
Hello.

471
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,790

472
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,730
Ms. Shen from Room 1201?

473
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,760
Yes, that's me.

474
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,550
There's a package from the embassy for you.

475
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,920
If you're home, open the door,

476
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,380
and I'll bring it up to you.

477
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,470
Sure, no problem.

478
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,500
I'll come right over.

479
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,310
Okay.

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,670
How is it? I did a good job, right?

482
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,820
I made three dishes.

483
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,360
Isn't it a bit bland?

484
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,420
Add some more salt.

485
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,660
We shouldn't add more salt.

486
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,030
Ms. Liu needs to eat lighter food recently.

487
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,200
But this is too bland.

488
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,950
And they're all vegetarian dishes.

489
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,630
What, are you eating all vegetarian dishes too after you go abroad?

490
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:37,200
It's okay. I'll teach you a few meat dishes this weekend.

491
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,680
Let's talk about it this weekend then.

492

How can we postpone it...

493

my dad's made a few extra dishes tonight.

495
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,280
Let's go home for dinner tonight.

496
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,800
Okay.

497
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,400
I'll tidy up a bit first.

498
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,150
I'll go wash my hands.

499

I can't eat anymore.

503
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,080
Come on, have a little more.

504
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,540
I worked hard to make this.

505
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,590
Okay?

506
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,820
Just one spoonful.
