00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,420
Hello, Ms. Liu.

4
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,660
I forgot the key.

5
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,540
Where did you put our spare key?

6
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,790
The spare key

7
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,520
is at Ms. Zhao's place in Unit 4.

8
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,440
But they went on a trip, so there's no one home.

9
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,140
Alright, never mind then.

10
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,100
I'll ask Xiangya.

11
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,660
I have a spare key with her.

12
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,329
I'll have her send it to me via flash delivery.

13
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,490
Okay, let me know once you get in.

14
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,350
Alright.

15
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,980
Bye bye.

16
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,860
Bye bye.

17
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:53,950
Xiangya,

18
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,390
can you send me a key via flash delivery?

19
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,700
I'll give you an address.

20
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,420
Hurry up,

21
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,020
or I won't be able to get home.

22
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,750
I just got out of the shower.

23
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,550
Where are you? I'll send it over.

24
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,820
I'm at He Suye's place.

25
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,930
Then why not just stay at his place?

26
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,300
I'm going to sleep now. Goodnight.

27
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,510
What did Xiangya say?

28
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
She said she happens to be out,

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,040
so...

30
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,340
she can't send me the key.

31
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,800
So, you...

32
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,649
can't go home tonight?

33
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,800
Right.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,080
So...

35
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,310
I might have to...

36
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,110
stay at your place for the night.

37
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,070
I only have one bedroom.

38
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,710
How about I sleep on the couch?

39
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,340
Wouldn't it be inappropriate to make you sleep on the couch because of me?

40
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,190
And it's not very comfortable.

41
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,550
Yeah. Indeed.

42
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,430
Later...

43
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,870
can you lend me a pair of pajamas

44
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,790
and a bath towel?

45
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,710
I want to take a shower first.

46
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,000
A shower first, huh?

47
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,340
Alright.

48
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,900
I'll go get a towel.

49
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,140
Wait.

50
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,110
I don't have pajamas in your size.

51
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,990
How about you wear my clothes?

52
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,720
Well, thanks.

53
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,930
Okay, I'll go get them.

54
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,870
He Suye,

55
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,270
where's the hairdryer?

56
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,220
It's in the drawer under the sink.

57
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,750
What's wrong?

58
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,630
I'm...

59
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,760
just looking at you.

60
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,430
If you keep doing this,

61
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,030
I won't be able to dry my hair.

62
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,150
I'll do it for you.

Okay.

85
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,920
What are you doing?

86
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,310
You like the smell of your shampoo so much?

87
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,830
Is this the smell of my shampoo?

88
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,290
Didn't I take a shower at your place yesterday?

89
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,910
Why does it not smell like that to me?

90
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,620
Alright.

91
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Get up and wash up.

92
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,040
No, I haven't slept enough yet.

93
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,790
You didn't

94
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,090
have enough sleep last night?

95
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,510
He Suye!

96
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,960
Go wash up. Go!

97
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,330
Out!

98
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,440
Then I'll go wash up first.

99
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,830
Are you awake?

100
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,790
Do you still need me to send the key?

101
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,420
No need.

102
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,370
What do you want to do this afternoon?

103
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,590
This afternoon?

104
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,250
What do you want to do?

105
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,250
You're asking me?

106
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,460
Well...

107
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
let's go shopping

108
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,880
and buy some daily necessities.

109
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,760
And...

110
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,450
let's buy two sets of pajamas.

111
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,610
Buy pajamas?

112
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,440
If you still want to wear my clothes,

113
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,390
I don't mind.

114
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,200
Just go.

115
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,680
Alright.

116
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,690
You wash up now.

117
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,370
I'll go make something to eat.

118
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,140
Pajamas...

119
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,510
He Suye,

120
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,660
can you come with me to buy shampoo and conditioner?

121
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,400
What's wrong?

122
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,830
You don't like the smell of my shampoo?

123
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,390
It's just that...

124
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,490
it doesn't suit me.

125
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,270
I think that scent suits you well.

126
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,980
Come on.

127
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,990
Lemon-scented?

128
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,130
Which one do you think I should buy?

129
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,860
One's citrus-scented and one's lemon-scented.

130
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,840
Citrus-scented and lemon-scented?

131
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,440
Just buy both.

132
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,200
Both?

133
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,120
Use them alternately.

134
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,670
You will often come to my place

135
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,730
to use them anyway.

136
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,870
Let's go and pay.

137
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,320
Who's going to come and use them often?

138
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,500
I'll take these three basic ones.

139
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,050
Okay.

140
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,090
Do you only use these usually?

141
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,170
No. But the full set isn't on sale.

142
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll just get the basic ones.

143
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,710
It's alright.

144
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,260
We'll take two of this set.

145
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,260
Okay.

146
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,700
Two sets?

147
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,250
Why?

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,290
Didn't I just say?

149
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,650
You can come and use them often at my place.

150
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,820
No, wait.

151
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,680
Two sets won't be enough. Make it three.

152
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,210
Okay, please wait a moment.

153
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,100
Three sets? You're being too exaggerated.

154
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,740
Don't worry.

155
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,800
You'll use them up.

156
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,560
Now that we've finished buying skincare products,

157
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
what do you think we should buy next?

158
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Pajamas.

159
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,070
Is this the kind of pajamas you wear?

160
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,570
Yeah.

161
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,720
Look how cute it is.

162
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,640
Let me tell you,

163
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,460
the fabric in this store is super comfortable.

164
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,460
How about I buy you a set too?

165
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,350
We can wear matching ones at home.

166
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,780
Alright.

167
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,570
Coffee.

168
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,980
Thank you.

169
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,300
What are you looking at?

170
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,720
Look at this flower.

171
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,790
It's so beautiful.

172
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,460
It's like a pink dandelion.

173
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,290
It is quite beautiful.

174
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,310
Isn't it?

175
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,550
[Summer]

176
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,060
Ms. Shen!

177
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,270
Ms. Shen!

178
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,030
He.

179
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

180
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,830
You two went shopping with so many things?

181
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,690
These are just some of our daily necessities.

182
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,670
Stop standing here.

183
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,470
Let's go home.

184
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,230
I'll put these things at my place first.

185
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,300
I'll come later.

186
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:03,880
It's...

187
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,420
I forgot my key last night,

188
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,450
so I stayed at his place.

189
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,190
Mrs. Shen,

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,300
this is for you.

191
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,070
Thank you.

192
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,150
Well... tonight, come back...

193
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,860
Come over for dinner.

194
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,120
Come over.

195
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,140
Okay, I'll... come over.

196
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,970
He'll come on.

197
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay, then...

198
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,980
Let's go home and cook.

199
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,040
Let's go, let's go.

200
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,700
What were you talking about?

201
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,670
I didn't mean it.

202
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,140
Let's go.

203
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,260
This is my house.

204
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
How did it turn into a password lock?

205
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,670
You're back.

206
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,530
This lock...

207
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,460
The old one was broken.

208
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,910
Yes.

209
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,460
The key didn't work.

210
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,540
We had no choice but to change it.

211
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,020
From now on, we'll use the password.

212
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,950
That way, you won't need

213
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,220
a key to get in.

214
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,370
The password is...

215
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,860
It's Ms. Shen's birthday.

216
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,220
Got it?

217
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:47,960
Yes.

218
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,200
Remember it for her.

219
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
I got it.

220
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,620
Give it a try.

221
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,600
Well, I'll give it a try.

222
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,690
The operation failed.

223
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,630
It's wrong. Your dad set the wrong password.

224
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,770
Why is he in such a good mood again?

225
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,150
What are you two up to?

226
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,970
Nothing.

227
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,210
In case you forget your key in the future,

228
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,140
I'm carrying the spare key with me.

229
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:13,990
You can make another copy.

230
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,390
I can keep one at my place.

231
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,450
No need.

232
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,680
What I mean is,

233
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,140
we have already changed it to an electronic lock,

234
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,070
so keys aren't necessary anymore.

235
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,510
An electronic lock?

236
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,300
So fancy.

237
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,450
Have you finished your theses?

238
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,430
Yes.

239
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,350
Of course.

240
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,780
Today is the deadline.

241
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,910
What day is it today?

242
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,120
You haven't finished your thesis yet?

243
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,190
Don't you want to graduate?

244
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,720
I'm almost done. I'm at the acknowledgments.

245
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:55,700
Almost?

246
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,940
Hurry up and finish it.

247
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,000
That way, I can take a look at it for you when you're done.

248
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,580
Oh, right.

249
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,350
I'll be attending your thesis defense.

250
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:06,150
The principal asked me to sit in.

251
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,190
Why?

252
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,540
Why do you have so many questions?

253
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,600
Just hurry up and finish your thesis.

254
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,530
That's enough.

255
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,150
It's uncomfortable for a guy to apply so much.

256
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,190
But every time, you make it so thick, like glue.

257
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,060
Do you know aging happens in an instant?

258
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
You're already 32.

259
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,390
-You need to learn how to take good care of your skin.
-Wait.

260
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,050
What's wrong with me being 32?

261
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
My face still looks fine, right?

262
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,740
At least I look younger than Song Feng.

263
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,950
Why don't you compare yourself to Li Jie?

264
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,480
What's there to compare between me and Li Jie?

265
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
Are you seriously jealous of Li Jie?

266
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,110
I won't be jealous anymore. Just apply it.

267
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,670
Let me help you rub it in.

268
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,390
Oh, right.

269
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,300
In a couple of days, I'm going to attend

270
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,910
the master's thesis defense.

271
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,910
Can you help me put together an outfit?

272
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,250
No problem, leave it to me.

273
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,250
Make me look good.

274
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,430
Don't worry.

278
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,220
Hello,

279
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,910
professors and experts.

280
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,460
I'm Li Jie, a graduate student from the class of 2021.

281
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,790
This is the topic of my graduation thesis.

282
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,390
I will present my defense

283
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,350
in five aspects:

284
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,150
research background,

285
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,110
research objectives,

286
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,150
research content,

287
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,910
research results,

288
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,150
and the limitations and outlook of my thesis.

289
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,460
Cervical cancer patients have severe symptoms,

290
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,320
and their post-operative conditions vary widely.

291
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,800
Finally, I'd like to thank my mentor, Professor Yu Liren,

292
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,110
for his careful guidance over the past three years,

293
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,670
and also Senior He Suye

294
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,440
for his encouragement and help,

295
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,710
as well as my friends and classmates for their company.

296
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,910
Thank you, everyone.

297
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,150
Thank you, Professor Yu.

298
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,060
Through more than two years of hard work,

299
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,150
you've proven your value.

300
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,740
Professor Yu, this is because of your excellent guidance.

301
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,240
Senior He.

302
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,040
Your thesis is good.

303
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,980
Congratulations

304
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,780
on your successful graduation.

305
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,260
Thank you for your encouragement and help before.

306
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,580
I want to say that

307
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,190
I've discussed it with the professor,

308
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,150
and I might

309
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,360
be transferred to the branch hospital in Ning City next week.

310
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
So,

311
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,540
I may be

312
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,320
staying in Ning City from now on

313
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,890
and might not have many chances to come back to Hang City.

314
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,450
Grandpa told me that.

315
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,700
The research center in Ning City

316
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,500
actually has a lot of potential.

317
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,500
I believe

318
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,560
you will achieve great results soon.

319
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,230
Thank you for your encouragement.

320
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,680
I wish you success in your career

321
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,940
and happiness in life.

322
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,640
And I wish you a bright future.

323
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,490
Go now.

325
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,110
Li Jie?

326
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,230
What's wrong?

327
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,460
Didn't we agree

328
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,860
to have dinner together after the defense?

329
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,610
Yeah. Isn't it in the evening?

330
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,860
What's wrong?

331
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,650
Actually, I want to say...

332
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,350
Fang Kexin,

333
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,590
do you know

334
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,780
that I like you?

335
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm sorry.

336
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,350
Li Jie, I...

337
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,880
We're good friends, right?

338
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,760
Of course we are.

339
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,590
Then I wish you

340
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,950
success in your studies

341
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,080
and a bright future.

342
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,940
Bye.

343
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,870
Professor,

344
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,190
He,

345
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,950
please stay.

346
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,680
Principal.

347
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,390
He,

348
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,810
I specifically asked you to come today

349
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,070
because I wanted to ask

350
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,240
if you'd be interested in coming back to school to teach.

351
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,430
You were an outstanding graduate,

352
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,390
your performance during your PhD was excellent,

353
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,260
and the four graduate students you mentored

354
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,060
did very well under your guidance.

355
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,780
So,

356
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,040
the school held a meeting and discussed it.

357
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,300
And we would like you to return and teach.

358
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,740
You'll have four hours of elective courses each week

359
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,590
and supervise internships at the hospital.

360
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,790
That will be your teaching assignment.

361
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,810
What do you think?

362
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,940
Are you interested?

363
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,190
Of course, I'm interested.

364
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,300
Thank you, Principal.

365
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,780
Thank you for giving him this opportunity,

366
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,620
and thank the school

367
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,060
for trusting him so much.

368
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,980
I should thank you

369
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,740
for having cultivated another talented TCM practitioner

370
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,470
for the school and the country.

371
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,780
On behalf of the school,

372
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,540
I thank you.

373
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,710
You're too kind.

374
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,060
It's okay.

375
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,190
You don't need to comfort me.

376
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,220
I've already asked the question.

377
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,990
That's already pretty good.

378
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,130
I can finally give up hope.

379
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,370
You've grown.

380
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,300
I've grown.

381
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,860
Well, since you've grown up,

382
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,530
how about sending me the photos you just took?

383
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,290
I need to send them to my girlfriend.

384
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,130
She helped me put this outfit together.

385
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,190
I should at least show her the result.

386
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,450
Resisting you is also part of my growth.

387
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,340
Li Jie,

388
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,640
you'd better pray that during your PhD,

389
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,300
you don't have to be my intern.

390
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,840
Good boy.

391
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,630
So ugly.

392
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,400
Alright.

393
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,390
Professor Yu!

394
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,720
I'm here. I'm here.

395
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,020
Mr. Shen?

396
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,020
-What a coincidence.
-Yes.

397
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,830
Such a coincidence.

398
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,780
Did you go to buy vegetables?

399
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,630
I bought some vegetables

400
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,960
on my way home from work.

401
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,020
Are you looking for He?

402
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,190
Yeah. I finished the meeting early today.

403
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,260
I want to ask him to join me for dinner.

404
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,350
This kid, living alone, doesn't eat on time.

405
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,830
He's always just making do.

406
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,430
Hasn't he finished work yet?

407
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,180
Why don't you come over to my place and have a seat?

408
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,950
I won't be disturbing you, will I?

409
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,980
Not at all.

410
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,460
Okay.

411
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,740
Sometimes,

412
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,670
these two young people

413
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,470
go out on dates

414
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,500
after work,

415
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,670
leaving just Ms. Liu and me at home.

416
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,430
This way, this way.

417
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,780
Okay.

418
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,220
I'll call He later

419
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,890
and tell him to come straight

420
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,219
to our place after work.

421
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,870
So silly.

422
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,130
That's wonderful.

423
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,120
Xifan was so beautiful at such a young age.

424
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,580
Look at those eyes.

425
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,770
You can tell by looking at her father

426
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,530
that our family has good genes.

427
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,620
Yes, yes.

428
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,540
She was even wearing sunglasses.

429
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,670
Such a little adult.

430
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,460
Professor Yu,

431
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,139
you're here.

432
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,070
You're off work?

433
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,679
Look who this is.

434
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,719
Ms. Liu.

435
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,139
He's been praising how cute you are.

436
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:46,909
Hurry up and sit down.

437
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,370
-Have a chat with Professor Yu.
-Put it away.

438
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,580
Come on.

439
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,310
Excuse me.

440
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:03,580
This tea

441
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,910
was also bought at a pharmacy.

442
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,430
It's their prescription.

443
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,200
You're showing off in front of an expert.

444
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,110
Yes, yes.

445
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,380
Not bad.

446
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,090
Why are you laughing?

447
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,580
Chef He.

448
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,950
Where are your photos?

449
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,310
Photos?

450
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,350
What photos?

451
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,200
Your childhood photos.

452
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,140
Childhood?

453
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,350
Why do you want to see my childhood photos?

454
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,180
Those are all embarrassing memories.

455
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,580
They're hideous. You're not allowed to see them.

456
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,270
It's precisely because

457
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,950
they're embarrassing that I want to see them.

458
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,410
If they weren't, why would I want to see them?

459
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,060
Why are you holding a bamboo shoot?

460
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,980
Don't hit me. Don't make trouble.

461
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,780
I'll beat you!

462
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,300
Don't cause trouble.

463
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,790
I'll bite you.

464
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,390
Be gentle!

465
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,280
You're trying to bite me, huh?

466
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,580
Excuse me.

467
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,070
If we don't cook now, it'll be too late to eat.

468
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,710
I won't disturb you.

469
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,790
No, no. You're not disturbing us.

470
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,920
I'll get the drinks.

471
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,670
I want to drink too.

472
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,650
He.

473
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,110
Let me help you.

474
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,390
Otherwise, our dinner

475
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,950
will really be too late.

476
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,430
You take the lead.

477
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,580
Tell me what to do.

478
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,760
How about you help me devein the shrimp?

479
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,160
No problem. I can do that.

480
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,840
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

481
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,500
I'll get you something to drink.

482
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,390
No need.

483
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,180
It's okay.

484
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,290
The soup will be ready soon.

485
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,490
Please wait a moment.

486
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,350
Hurry, show it to her.

487
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:06,710
Look.

488
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,460
Time to eat.

489
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,580
Got it.

490
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,100
He was so chubby when he was little.

491
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,870
It was fine.

492
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,040
How cute.

493
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,240
Look at this one.

494
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,180
Grandpa, why are you showing my photos to Xifan?

495
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,350
You were very cute when you were little.

496
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,100
Much cuter than you are now.

497
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,420
I think so too.

498
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,710
Let's eat. The dinner is ready.

499
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,500
Alright.

500
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,460
Let's eat.

501
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,500
Stop looking. Let's eat.

502
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,270
Okay.

503
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:41,980
Mr. Shen, Ms. Liu,

504
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,450
today, you should try

505
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,580
Suye's cooking.

506
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,790
Okay.

507
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,660
Xifan.

508
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,790
Thank you.

509
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,460
Please sit down.

510
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,910
Let me do it.

511
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,540
Please, have a seat.

512
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,140
You don't need to do it.

513
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,200
Alright, alright.

514
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,920
It's Mr. Shen's own recipe.

515
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,750
Please try it.

516
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,500
The Chinese medicine is a bit too hot.

517
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,350
Why don't you drink it later?

518
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,080
Let me check.

519
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,060
Oh, it's too hot.

520
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,570
I can't drink it now.

521
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,460
Ms. Liu, are you feeling unwell?

522
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,980
Why are you taking medicinal soup?

523
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,070
He prescribed it for me last time.

524
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,110
He said it would help with my health.

525
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,830
Let me check your pulse.

526
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,480
That would be so great.

527
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,330
Come on.

528
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,350
Do you need something to put under it?

529
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,100
A towel will do.

530
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:31,820
Look at Grandpa.

531
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,830
He's usually alone at home in the countryside,

532
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,660
and it's been boring.

533
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,430
He's so happy to be here today.

534
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,510
Well, you should come more often in the future.

535
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,910
Of course, as long as you're okay with it.

536
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,620
It's fine. Just leave them to me.

537
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,540
Let me check your tongue coating.

538
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,250
Okay.

539
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,660
Since she started taking

540
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,460
the medicine He prescribed,

541
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,140
there's been quite a big change,

542
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,620
especially in her temperament.

543
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,820
It's improved a lot compared to before.

544
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,910
Don't listen to him.

545
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,910
Actually,

546
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,310
I just felt a bit tight in my chest before.

547
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,580
I felt like I couldn't breathe. Since I started taking the medicine,

548
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,910
it has really improved.

549
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,150
Here.

550
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,650
Let me check this hand.

551
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,190
Since Suye's medicine

552
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,590
has had a good effect,

553
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,270
you should continue taking it for a while.

554
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,870
Okay.

555
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,400
Is everything alright?

556
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,950
Yes. You're fine.

557
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,950
Have you had your regular physical checkup this year?

558
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,010
I actually haven't done it this year.

559
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,620
I forgot.

560
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,580
Physical checkups are quite important.

561
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,270
Only by combining the results of the checkup

562
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,430
with the signs in the pulse

563
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,230
can you fully understand

564
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,080
a person's health status.

565
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,830
So, I suggest you

566
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,230
get one.

567
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,290
Okay.

568
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,750
I'll schedule it for next month.

569
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm thinking of

570
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,740
having one next month.

571
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,170
Mr. Shen, let me check your pulse as well.

572
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,560
That would be so great.

573
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,270
Come, come.

574
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,570
Let me.

575
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,580
I'll take off my watch.

576
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,650
I'm doing well.

577
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,410
It's just that sometimes I don't sleep very well.

578
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,870
I've submitted my resignation.

579
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,100
I'll officially leave in a month.

580
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,890
[Submitted Successfully]

581
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,830
I'm back.

582
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,280
What's this?

583
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,680
It's so heavy.

584
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,160
These are things from my office.

585
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,430
I'm planning to move them back little by little,

586
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,500
like ants moving their home.

587
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,010
Can't you just move everything at once?

588
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,370
Why do you have to move them bit by bit?

589
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:16,920
No.

590
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,060
So much?

591
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,020
Whenever regular customers come,

592
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,910
I spray their favorite scents

593
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,830
on their

594
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,580
welcome cards.

595
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,390
I used to use different perfumes

596
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,790
depending on my mood each day.

597
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,870
I didn't realize how much I've bought

598
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:50,470
until I started organizing.

599
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,460
This one seems like men's perfume.

600
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,590
Want to give it a try?

601
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,830
No, I don't usually wear perfume.

602
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,240
Alright, then I'll give it away.

603
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,910
Can I have this pen?

604
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,150
What do you need a pen for?

605
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,420
Ballpoint pens are like currency in the hospital.

606
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,210
This one is so noticeable.

607
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,710
I'd like to see

608
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:20,100
who's been stealing pens from me.
