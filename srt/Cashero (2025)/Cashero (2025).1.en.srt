- Then bend that one.

For now, just follow me.

Wait, but first, put this back how it was.

373
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:02,928
[Sang-ung] Mm.

10,000? Come on, 10,000.

00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,566
[Min-suk] Hmm.

00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,446
For starters,
we don't know how this works.

380
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,033
Like, can it only be done with cash?
And how much exactly?

381
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,994
- We should do some tests.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,205
If we're lucky,
we might be able to use it.

383
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,167
- Yeah, let's go.
- All right.

- Here, take a peek.
- Sure.

415
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,615
There are just way too many restrictions.

416

NO CHANGE

417
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,495
You can only use cash, and you need
to have it somewhere on your body.

418
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,664
- [Sang-ung] 10,000…
- 10,000 won lets you jump two meters.

419
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,791
But a ladder costs less.

420
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,502
It would be great if you could compete
in the UFC,

421
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,420
but all the coins would be
spilling everywhere.

422
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,965
And if you ran out of money,
you could end up dying in the octagon.

using a machine is more efficient.

426
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,521
We should focus on marriage…
and buying a house.

427
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,606
There's only one lottery left
in central Seoul.

428
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,777
If you go around using your power,
we kiss that goodbye.

429
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,118
I think it's best if we don't use it.

430
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,704
[Sang-ung] Mm-hmm.

431
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,290
It has no purpose.
