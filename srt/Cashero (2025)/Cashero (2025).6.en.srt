He took all of them.
My little brother is such a rascal.

8
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,425
When it comes to stuff like this,
that little fucker works fast.

00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,445
I have a dinner.
Formal meeting with my in-laws.

00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,571
I'm late.

00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,822

75
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,677
A good first impression
with your future in-laws is crucial.

76
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,770
This kind of thing
is why our jobs are so hard.

77
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,942
I wish there was
an easier sense of balance in our work.

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,778
But having special powers

79
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,364
means your personal life
won't be easy or normal.

80
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,284
That's your burden.

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,461
Better head out.

Oh.

93
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,536
I'm with the police.
You're Ms. Kim, correct?

94
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,956
Yes, Kim Min-suk. What can I do for you?

95
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,416
I need to find Kang Sang-ung.

96
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,714
I was about to call and file a report.
I have no idea where he is.

97
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,760
Kang Sang-ung is currently a suspect
in an active investigation,

98
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,553
so we need your cooperation here.

99
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,679
Detective, please.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,933
He's completely normal. That's the truth.

101
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,645
What, the police really believe
all these online rumors too?

102
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,897
So, what? You think he suddenly gets
superhuman strength

103
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,524
when he's holding cash or whatever?

104
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,943
You're smarter than that.
Right, Detective?

105
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
[chuckles] Superpowers? Yeah, right.

106
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,447
It's so ridiculous.

107
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,537
I know you're all hiding over there!

108
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,872
[Min-suk scoffs]

109
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,917
Well, I hope
you're all getting overtime tonight!

110
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,551
[sighs]

111
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,972
Let's say it's true.

112
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,475
Imagine Sang-ung really did have
a unique gift like that.

113
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,810
To use it…

114
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,647
he'd only spend his own money.

115
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,067
- [panting]
- [emotional music playing]

116
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,069
And he'd do it to protect others.

117
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,071
And help anyone who needs it.

118
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,282
He'd punish muggers and criminals.

119
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,284
[breathes deeply]

120
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,245
He'd do a better job than you guys.

121
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,038
You collect overtime,
and never catch anyone.

122
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,083
So now you're going to arrest a man
making our streets safer.

123
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,170
He's doing <i>your </i>job
while you watch from the sidelines!

00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,643
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,646
I said don't be late, Sang-ung.

128
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,441
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,577
[grunts]

130
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,705
But you told me it would all be okay.

[Bun-mi sighs]

141
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,793
Sang-ung can get through
that dinner, right? I feel so anxious.

142
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,628
[groans] Yeah, I know.

143
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,216
Do you think that her folks
will approve of his tattered jacket?

144
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,926
No idea.

145
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,557
I wonder who called those detectives.

146
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,727
Wait. I assumed that was you.

147
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,147
I didn't call.

148
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,816
[door opens]

149
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,442
- [Anna] It was me.
- [tense music playing]

150
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,408
It's so important
to report illegal activity.

Bun-mi.

[music fades]

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,427
I haven't committed a crime, sir.

159
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,015
I told you to lay low, Sang-ung.
Said I'd lock you up if I saw you again.

160
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:45,811
Come on. Don't you have powers?

161
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,897
That's why I have to do this.

162
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,316
You think you're above the law? [tuts]

163
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,985
Think you're righteous? [scoffs]

164
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,197
You know that saying?

165
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,741
"The road to hell
is paved with good intentions."

166
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,076
It's cliché 'cause it's true.

167
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,662
Because of you,
more people are gonna end up getting hurt.

168
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,165
[chuckles]

169
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,587
[sighs]

170
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,048
And you keep on
sitting around doing nothing.

171
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,468
- I feel you.
- [melancholy music playing]

172
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,720
I wanna sit on the couch
and put the news on,

173
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,389
get pissed off at criminals,

174
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,224
shout at the screen,
and then go off to bed.

175
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,850
[sighs]

176
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,061
I couldn't live with myself if I did that.

177
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,896
With our powers, we can fight.

178
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,151
Don't you think we have a responsibility
to protect the innocent?

179
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,279
You were almost right before.

180
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,741
Except when we do nothing,
that's when people get hurt.

181
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,003

A lot more. I guarantee you that.

It was to keep things quiet

The press and the police are
circling like vultures.

Oh. What the hell?

[Nathan] "It's the bleeding of the masses

You haven't caught Sang-ung.

You're not stalling deliberately?

330

Of course not.

00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,570
So what does some bank have to do
with taking out Jo Nathan?

338
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,073
The truth is, my father doesn't exactly
trust me like he used to,

339
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,452
so he chose to move
the superpower ampoules there en masse.

340
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,746
And I'm guessing the three of us
just have to believe you?

If I was wrong about this,
I'd have very serious problems.

The truth is,
the Food and Drug Safety Ministry

345
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,301
is announcing a drug
which just got approved.

346
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,928
Once it's on the market, it's all over.

347
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,138
For your society, for us,

348

00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,694
So we're supposed to steal the ampoules
to stop the development of this drug?

352
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,155
Well, they were yours originally,
so you have every right.

353
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:42,499
There's a vault hidden inside.
I'm going to give you directions to it.

[Anna] <i>It looks like a normal bank,</i>

361
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,435

Luckily, you guys are a special crew.

You got this, right?

378

The three of you get
to save the whole world,

379
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,037
Jo Nathan will get what he deserves, and…

380
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,085
I return as the rightful heir.

381
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,678
JO ANNA
HEIR TO BEOMHA GROUP

382
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,348
You sure Jo Anna isn't just using us?

383
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,891
Of course she is.

384
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,934
She's just exploiting us
to get rid of Jo Nathan

385
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,937
and to steal back the superpower ampoules
after the bank heist.

386
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,732
And after that,
she'll capture us and take us to Won-do.

387
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,943
She'll show up after we enter the bank.
Our first goal is to get her off our tail.

388
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,157
If you knew,
why'd you both agree to do the job?

[Ho-in sighs]

390
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,583

[melancholy music playing]

392
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,631
Just like Jo Anna said.

393
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,884
If we get the superpower ampoules,
we have a shot at stopping Jo Nathan.

394
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,681
Also, Gimhae Bank is vital
to the Mundane Vanguard.

395
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,852
Don't worry.

396
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,150
I assume the Vanguard started accumulating
gigantic amounts of money

397
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,277
the minute they found out
about your powers.

398
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,824
We'll find their money and burn all of it.

399
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,246
If we do it right,
we could cripple them completely.

400
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,421
Hey, Sang-ung,
why did you agree to do this?

401
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,507
Easy.

402
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,970
She said I could get rid of
that bastard Jo Nathan.

403
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,723
That's the reason.

404
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,224
[chuckles]

405
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,226
[Ho-in] Good enough for me.

406
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,482
Look, we should go in here.

407
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,694
I'll start by scoping out
all the security cameras.

408
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,696
Ho-in, you'll enter first…

Why not?

412
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,877
I don't know if you were listening
to what their plan was, Sang-ung.

413
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,295
All you are is bait to these guys.

414
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,298
Yeah, I mean, what else is new?

415
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,342
- I still have to do it.
- Kang Sang-ung.

416
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,597

[Min-suk] You took out a private loan
behind my back.

422
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,624
You ruined the family dinner too.

423
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,627
Now, we're completely broke,
and I'm being held as collateral.

424
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,378
But you know what?
It's fine. I don't care.

425
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,255
We'll be able to pay it back eventually.

426

We're actually better off with you using
your own money to get stronger.

427

But this is different.

428
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,555
I think you know that.

429
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,482
You're risking our lives
to put up a fight against the Vanguard.

430
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,485
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

we can set the table for dinner.

So how much do you need?

451
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,211
To put a stop to all of it.

452
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,172
To finish the job and walk away.

453
