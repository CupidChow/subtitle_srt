[Bun-mi] You said you were curious
about selling our superpowers.

242

[Sang-ung] Well, I just wanna know.

243
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,938
Is it even possible to sell them?

Is something like that dangerous?

245
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,234
I know for sure, powers can be extracted.

246
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,194
That guy had Hwa-jin's somehow.

Huh.

248
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,241
