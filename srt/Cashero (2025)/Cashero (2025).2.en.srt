202
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,707
It's incredibly admirable what you did.

203

Even I was proud of you.

204
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,211
Aside from that,

205
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,006
how'd you think to call
with all that chaos surrounding you?

206
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,467
[clears throat] Well, first, uh,

207
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,427

Be honest,

211
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,232
you can't wait to find out
how I know who your father is.

212
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,149

220
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,299

I bet you feel brand-new

And if I injected this?

255
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,626
What?

00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,587
Take it.

That's right, ma'am.

264
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,944
Then hit him even harder

265
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,238
so he won't be able
to use his powers at all.

266
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,948
Should I block all his income streams?

267
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,076
That'd be boring.
It's really a battle of type advantages.

268
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,662
He needs paper money, right?
