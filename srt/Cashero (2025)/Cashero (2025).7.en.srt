If I have to use my own money,

then I never stood a chance at all!

00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,761
Shit.

364
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,180
[sighs]

365
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,851
[music fades]

366
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,984
[Won-do] The extent
of that loser's superpowers

367
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,194
proved more than you could handle.

368
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,238
[uneasy music playing]

369
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,165
[music intensifies]

370
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,209
[music swells]

371
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,877
[music subsides]

372
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,087
[scoffs]

373
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,300
Having to live with your failure

374
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,343
is a punishment
that is far worse than death.

375
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,262
[tense music playing]

376
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,431
It's funny how pride works.

377
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,017
If you lose it, you lose everything.

378
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,365
[music intensifies]

379
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,203
[music swells]

380
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,288
[music subsides]

381
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,332
- Chairman.
- [phone buzzing]

382
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,542
JO ANNA

383
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,795
What is it now?

384
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,006
<i>There are two things in this world</i>

385
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,301
<i>no one has ever been able</i>
<i>to keep me from getting my hands on.</i>

386
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,386
BORROWER: JO SIN-IL
LENDER: PARK HYEONG-DO

387
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,387
[tense music playing]

388
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,722
The cash owed on a debt,

389
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,599
and the truth.

390
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,354
Sorry to let you down,
but I don't owe any debt.

391
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,773
That's not what
the ledger I'm holding says.

392
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,528
It's taken me a long time
to uncover your dirty little secret.

393
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,869
Your empire may have taken
a century to build…

394
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,707
but it can all come crashing down
in the blink of an eye.

395
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,629
You should know
I'm not as forgiving as my father was.

396
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,927
I suggest you cough up the cash you owe,
or your health could suffer.

397
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,228
Your phone, little girl.

398
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,649
You're gonna regret this.

399
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,109
Oh, really?

400
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,405
I'd watch my mouth
before you find out what regret is.

401
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,242
I'll keep this money safe.
You can tell your father that.

402
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,535
Take it away.

403
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,911
[men] Yes, ma'am!

404
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,965
[sighs angrily]

405
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,592
[music fades]

406
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,227
[Sang-ung] <i>Having superpowers</i>
<i>is a major pain.</i>

407
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,437
<i>But having them taken away</i>

408
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,106
<i>right when you're starting</i>
<i>to get the hang of them,</i>

409
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,234
<i>somehow, that's even worse.</i>

410
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,614
[door opens]

411
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,032
[device beeping]

412
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,245
[door closes]

413
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,920
Min-suk?

414
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,761
Min-suk?

415
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,015
Hey, Min-suk!

416
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,184
Hey, Min…

417
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,352
Min-suk!

418
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,564
[breathes anxiously]

419
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,065
[phone buzzing]

420
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,197
[buzzing continues]

421
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,205
Oh shit.

422
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,834
- Uh, hello--
- I was touched by what you said earlier.

423
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,462
[uneasy music playing]

424
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,590
Where is Min-suk?

425
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,726
[Min-suk] I'm here, Sang-ung. I'm fine.

426
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,062
Don't worry about me.

427
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,773
Hey, Min-suk.

428
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,274
Are you all right?

429
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,569
Uh, just hold on a little longer.
I'll be right there.

430
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,364
Why do you keep making things
more difficult?

431
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,910
Listen, let's figure this out.

432
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,454
You already know what I want.

433
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,040
Fine, then, I'll come to you.

434
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,875
<i>Just leave Min-suk out--</i>

435
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,919
[tense music playing]

436
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,712
Hey. Hey! Hey!

437
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,381
Hey, you motherfucker!

438
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,424
I said I'd come. I'm coming right now!

439
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,472
[breathing nervously]

440
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,308
[pants]

441
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,060
I decide when.

442
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,063
<i>You just wait quietly.</i>

443
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,024
[disconnect tone]

444
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,861
Shit. Come on.

445
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,781
[automated voice] <i>The person</i>
<i>you are trying to reach is unavailable…</i>

446
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,209
You really think you're gonna win,
don't you?

447
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,127
[music fades]

448
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,713
You don't have what it takes
to beat Kang Sang-ung.

449
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,840
What makes you so sure?

450
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,760
Because Sang-ung…

451
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,223
is terrible at calculations.

452
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,474
[pensive music playing]

453
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,186
In the end, he always chooses
to do what he thinks is right,

454
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,855
no matter how impossible

455
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,481
or how much he'll get hurt.

456
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,150
[Nathan] Ah, I see.

457
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,320
So that's why
that little loser is always broke.

458
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,197
[laughs] No.
Sang-ung was broke to begin with.

459
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,870
Why would you choose
a pushover like that guy?

460
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,246
He thinks he's a saint.

461
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,248
Yeah, but you've got it wrong.

462
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,919
That pushover is the one
who is putting up with me.

463
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,547
And I should warn you
that he's not a pushover for anyone else.

464
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,466
How touching.

465
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,760
[Min-suk] Damn right, it's touching.
I married him!

466
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,471
[sighs]

467
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,722
From where I sit,

468
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,099
it feels like you're trying
to take my husband away from me.

469
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,269
You ruined our dinner with the in-laws.

470
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,813
Now, we can't even have our wedding!

471
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,732
[scoffs]

472
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,237
Just you wait and see.

473
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,573
You're gonna lose.

474
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,117
We'll see who makes it out of this.

475
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,958
[pensive music continues]

<i>that give superpowers.</i>

478
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,497
[man] <i>I'll look into it.</i>

479
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,582
You won't just look into it.
Go lock up that psycho.

480
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,837
[music fades]

481
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,381
[sighs]

482
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,759
Why'd we go all the way out to Gimhae
to let him go first chance we get?

483
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,970
What's really going on here?

484
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,601
Kang Sang-ung. Why isn't he under arrest?

485
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,021
[inhales deeply]

486
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,856

488
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,403
And since when did we start letting people
who break into safes go?

00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,322
[inhales deeply]

490
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,491
Look, guys.

491
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,286
There's one thing more valuable
than cash in this world.

492
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,038
Know what it is?

493
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,290
What?

494
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,960
It's time.

495
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,087
[inhales deeply]

496
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,632

Min-suk, where is she?

508
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,434
We'll get to that.
You need to pass a test first.

509
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,533
What kind of test?

510
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,660
I heard in the safe you passed out.

511
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,037
If it's true you lost your power,

512
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,331
then I think it's best
if everybody moves on.

513

<i>it means I'm completely useless to them.</i>

00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,639
If you take me down,

517
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,600
I'll take you to your girl.

your days are numbered.

523

I'm sorry to say,

524
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,284
there's something fun
that Min-suk wanted to share.

525
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,454
So I think I'll stay above ground.
