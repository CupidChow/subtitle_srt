376
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,360
Sang-ung, I swear to God,

377
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,615
if you ever do anything that dangerous
ever again, I will…

378
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,327
I'll actually kill you.

379
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

380
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,165
I'm so sorry.

[Sang-ung] <i>What did I miss?</i>
<i>How did this happen?</i>

382
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,129
<i>I know for a fact I didn't have any money.</i>

383
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,855
- That's Kang Sang-ung!
- No, just wait.

384
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,190
It's okay.

385
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,151
You guys keep the area closed off.
Go find the commanding officer.

386
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,028
- But what about Kang Sang-ung?
- Just do it! Go!

387
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,613
Hurry! Go! Now!

388
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,450
Yes, sir, I'm on it.
Let's go to the west side.

389

[detective] Why are you standing there?
Go! Hurry!

391
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,413

[music fades]

393
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,257
Are you feeling okay?

394
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,008
[groans] I've been better.

395
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,843
Let's get outta here.

396
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,971
- Right. Let's go.
- Right.

397
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,933
Wait a minute.

398
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,936

403
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,235
Should it be this difficult to come home?

404
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,781
[sighs] I get involved to save your life,

405
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,576
just so you can come back here to die.

[sighs]

407
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:11,713
Hello.

409
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,977
You guys sure do work hard.

410
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,731
I've waited for this moment
for what feels like an eternity.

411
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,857
You have no idea.

Do you have any last words
before saying goodbye?

[chuckles] Speechless?

416
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,131

[Nathan] It's so funny.

425
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,061
I've been waiting an eternity

[door opens]

439
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,895
Having a happy household
is like indulging in heaven early.

440
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,856
The more I see under this roof,
I'm afraid that it resembles hell.

442
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,942
I guess things aren't going well.

443
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,694
Oh, but don't worry.

444
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,739
You'll stay breathing

Haven't you gone far enough already?

464
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,982
I need to bring Sang-ung in.

465
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,025
After that,

466
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,236

Here's your teddy.
I need you to go inside.

[Sang-ung] Hey.

523
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,462
You gotta stop bothering
these innocent people.

524
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,633
I'm the one you want.
Why don't you try fighting me instead?

525
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,344
You're right.
You should've gotten here earlier.

I know it seems pretty cool
in the beginning,

532
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,199
but after a while,
it really starts to suck.

533
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,826
A normal life is better in every way.

534
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,954
Take my word for it.
