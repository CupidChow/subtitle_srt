Hey. Do you know who that detective is?

362
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,593
- He was one of us.
- A superhuman?

363
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,012
Are you serious?

364
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,680
So what's his power?

365
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,348
He's good at picking fights.

366
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,895
Wait a second.

367
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,813
Why's he bringing me in
in the first place?

368
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,065
Is he Mundane Vanguard?

369
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,027
We just don't have the same point of view.
Everything's okay. Don't worry.

370
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,070
I don't know how not to worry.

371
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,698
- He… he said he'd send me to prison--
- I've got it under control.

372
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,458

[music fades]

374
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,048
No, it's all right.
I've been cutting carbs recently.

375
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,092
[chuckles]

376
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,343
God, that's such horseshit.

377
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,847
You should keep an eye on your health now
if you wanna live long.

378
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,810
You haven't changed at all
since you were little.

379
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,104
Always running your mouth
and saying nothing.

380
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,774
[sighs] Gee. I should've just killed you
when I had the chance.

[music fades]

385
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,614
What happened?

386
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,073
I had 'em all drugged.

387
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,743
The replication of powers
is what we're after.

388
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,328
How do you know that?

389
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,413
I'm part of this family. Of course I know.

390
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,123
[Anna scoffs]

391
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,918
It was pretty much
just one big clinical trial.

392
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,422
They're covering it on the news
all day, every day right now.

393
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,216
What's the point of us
drawing unwanted attention?

394
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,468
I mean, Dad.

395
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,013
This idiot's purposely trying
to bring everything down.

396
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,556
You're right about one thing.

397
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,934
It was on purpose.
So Kang Sang-ung would see.

398
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,229
You're so full of shit.

399
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,315
[pensive music playing]

400
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,277
Father. Do you know
what's in every hero's nature?

401
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,405
How they love meddling.

402
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,825
Sticking their noses
where they don't belong.

403
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,371
They can't ignore things.
They've gotta do something.

404
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:46,581
[chuckles]

405
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,086
He's gonna look for me soon. I know it.

406
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:56,591
I will lure this "hero" to a location
where I have the advantage.

407
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,259
[chuckles]

408
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,305
From now on,

409
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,183
I want you to take control
of the lab work.

410
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,810
[tense music playing]

411
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,312
Dad, please.

412
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,316
It's the bleeding of the masses

413
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,735
that allows our coffers to fill up.

414
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,320
Let's eat.

415
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,865
[Anna sighs]

416
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,169
[music subsides]

417
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,636
You were questioned by the police?

418
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,806
When you go to prison,
don't mention any of our names, please.

419
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,518
I told you not to joke around.
This is serious. I'm freaking out here.

420
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,022
Now that you're done reading all of that,

421
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,691
the names for their clinical trial.

422
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,282
Apparently, six people on that list
were among the ones we saw jump yesterday.

423
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,200
[screaming]

424
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,913
The Mundane Vanguard
is conducting experiments

425
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,665
on ordinary citizens.

Let's catch Hermes as quickly as possible
and get the drugs.

437
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,832
After their clinical trials, they'll start
replicating powers so they can sell them.

438
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,795
Before there are more casualties,
we gotta stop these guys…

439

at all costs.

- Huh? Right now?
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,450
I don't have any cash.

- Give me a minute.
- We're not doing that.

450
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,038
You need something to wear

Did something happen?

It's our official dinner.
Keep it spotless.

It's in case of emergency only.
Don't be stupid.

Yeah, don't worry.

481
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,720
Wait. Could I borrow another 50?
