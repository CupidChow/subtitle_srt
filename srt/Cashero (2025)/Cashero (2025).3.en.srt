We have to make the most of our names

37
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,872
Just like our superpowers,
right, Sang-ung?

Oh, Sang-ung. Tell me you're okay.

44
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,690
- I'm okay. What about you though?
- I'm fine, don't worry.

45
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,191
All right, let's get acquainted.

46
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,074
This girl here is Bang Eun-mi,

47
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,785
but she goes by Bun-mi
'cause this girl can crush a brioche.

Stop it. I hate that.

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,790
Bun-mi has the ability
to move objects with her mind

relative to the amount of calories
she's eaten.

51

Okay, well, uh, what are you saying, sir?

55

What I'm saying is
you're not alone in the world.

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,483
We're like you.
Isn't that nice to know, that

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,819
you have companions?

58
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,867

00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,926
- I think we should get out of here.
- Let's go.

66
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,637
We find superhumans
who operate in the shadows, like you,

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,597
and we take them out into the light.

68

That's where they belong.
Fighting for what's right.

so I'll have to pass.

71

burned down your home?

are used to getting everything they want.

Their influence is far-reaching.

108

They have money, power,
access to business deals and land,

[Old Man Do moans]

531
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,824
[music fades]

532
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,243
- You're Dong-gi's son, aren't you?
- That's right.

533
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,954
- So you're penniless then, right?
- Huh?

534
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,583
Yeah.

535
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,252
Looking at this shack,
you wouldn't know I'm rich, right?

536
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,171
Definitely not.

537
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,799
So has Samsung finally topped out
at 10,000 won?

538
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,258
We're onto stocks?

539
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:07,263
No, I'm pretty sure that, uh, Samsung,
uh, plateaued around 60,000. Yeah.

540
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,473
Goddamn it.

541
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,101
[inhales sharply] Maybe I should've
pulled out at 80, huh?

542
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:13,812
[slurps]

543
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,689
Look, I'm here because they said
you'd know if I'm ready to actually,

544
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,650
ya know, join the society.

545
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,027
Sure. That's right.

546
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,491
Let me get a good look at your eyes.

547
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,499
- [dramatic music playing]
- [rattling]

548
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,297
Oh God. What's happening now?

549
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,383
[loud clattering]

550
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,637
Oh shit! Sorry! Excuse me.

551
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,557
[distorted echoing] The gold's shine
loses its gleam in the dark.

552
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,017
So take heed, young man.

553
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,144
Your power can cease to shine.

554
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,523
Uh, but wait. What do you mean?

555
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,944
Only when you put your fate at hazard,

556
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,363
like throwing coins into a well
as a child,

557
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:10,201
only then might… the gold
regain its brilliant sheen.

558
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,998
I'm not sure what you're saying.

559
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,379
[music intensifies]

560
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,089
- [music subsides]
- [mask clatters]

561
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,217
Uh, sir?

562
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,305
Hey, old man Do! Oh!

563
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,020
[exhales]

564
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,188
You're Dong-gi's son, aren't you?

565
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,860
Yeah. Yes.

566
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,196
You're penniless, then. Right?

567
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,285
Yeah.

568
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,499
What did he tell you?

569
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,128
Well, I'm confused.

570
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,673
I think the old man's
a little crazy, actually.

571
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,217
He was blabbering,
his eyes were all white.

572
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,552
[Ho-in] Oh, right.

573
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,888
I'm sure he probably said
only what he had to.

574
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,476
The man can't remember the past,
even though he sees the future.

575
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,064
We're all like that to some degree.

576
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,649
We lose it all.

577
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,984
Health, money, precious memories.

578
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,236
Can't do anything about it.

579
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,405
Guess not.

580
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,574
[Old Man Do] Bun-mi.

581
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,660
[stirring music playing]

582
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,121
Get over here.

583
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,832
[Bun-mi] What for?

584
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,335
[whooshing]

585
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,881
[tense music playing]

586
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,568
[Bun-mi gasps]

587
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,778
I owe you one.

588
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,572
Was that respect?

589
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,490
Oh God, stop it.

590
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:13,950
[chuckles]

591
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,159
[loud clattering]

592
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,202
Our enemy is here.

593

[tires squeal]

594
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,463
[thug 1] Okay, out, out.
Hurry up, let's move it!

595
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,881
All right. Everyone, up the hill!

596
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,050
[indistinct shouting]

597
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,559
[music intensifies]

598
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,158
[thug 1] They're over there!
This way, hurry up!

599
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,620
Bun-mi, get the old man
to a secure location.

600
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,375
Sang-ung.

601
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,418
Yeah?

602
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,921
- Here.
- Thanks.

603
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,131
You better run.

604
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,716
- [music subsides]
- Huh?

605
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,052
You get captured, we're done for.
There's a retaining wall.

606
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,513
- That should be enough to get over it.
- Hang on. But then you'll be alone, right?

607
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,266
Well, it's an alley.
I'll block it up, okay?

608
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,852
- Hang on a sec.
- Go already!

609
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,687
[distant shouting]

610
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,195

[breathing heavily]

632
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,843
What do you want me to do for you?

633
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,013
What the hell are you talking about?
You sound like a lunatic.

634
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,849
Look, you've been after me
'cause of my dad.

635
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,809
You said you wanted me
to marry your daughter.

636
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,854
It's 'cause you need me
to do something for you, right?

637
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,648
Come on. I know you don't really care
about his debts.

[unsettling tense music playing]

639
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,654
Listen, you need to stop blathering
and pay me in full.

640
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,322
I'll do it.

641

[chuckles]

649
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,313
Sorry about the call.

650
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,690
That was actually
my future son-in-law on the phone.

Ah. I see. That's fine.

652

So your name is Kim Min-suk.

- Hey, hey, hey!

666
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,321
[Anna] Did you really think
you'd be safer,

667
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,699
causing all this commotion
in broad daylight?

668

You know,
we really should've met like this sooner.

672
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
All right.

673
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,501
Kang Sang-ung. Where is he now?

674
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,965
I've waited such a long time
to see you like this, in the flesh.

[pensive music playing]

676
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,972
I have to get a good look
at a person's eyes

677
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,349
to get a proper glimpse into their future.

678

to go up a size in underwear.

Look at this mess. I can't fit it all in.
