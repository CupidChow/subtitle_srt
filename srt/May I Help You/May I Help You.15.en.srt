1
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:33,784
Well...

2
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,582
Can I ask you something first?

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,376
What?

4
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,632
You know, the cigarettes
that my older brother used to smoke.

5
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,263
How did you find that out?

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,647
Just tell me. I'm curious, that's all.

7
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,569
You can tell me, right?

8
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,116
I believe everything you say, Dong-joo.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,452
I agree with everything you say.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,103
Don't be like this.

11
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,150
Tell me.

12
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,534
Your older brother...

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,286
I met him.

14
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,406
Ouch.

15
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,043
Hurry and tell me.

16
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,006
How did you find out?

17
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,623
Stop it.

18
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,643
Dong-joo.

19
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,648
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,775
Dong-joo, are you okay?

21
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,573
Dong-joo

22
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,785
Dong-joo.

23
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,036
What happened?

24
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,371
Are you okay?

25
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,714
Tae-hee. Go.

26
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,299
Hurry.

27
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:23,764
I bought one pack of beer--
Hey! Where are you going?

28
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,015
Hae-an!

29
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,726
What the...?

30
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,771
Take care of Dong-joo.

31
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,481
Hey! Dong-joo?

32
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:34,984
Dong-joo!

33
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,112
Dong-joo.

34
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,824
Dong-joo.

35
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,742
Dong-joo, what's wrong? Are you okay?

36
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:44,910
Police...

37
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,620
Call the police please.

38
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,332
Hey!

39
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,169
Seo Hae-an!

40
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,002
Seo Hae-an!

41
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,103
I want to be a police officer.

42
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,939
I got valedictorian.

43
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,609
-Number one in police academy.
-Nice work, Hae-an.

44
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,863
Sir.

45
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,574
Please save me.

46
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:54,039
I'm going to get stronger
and catch all the bad guys.

47
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,342
I'm also going to catch all the people
who are rude to you.

48
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,685
I'm never going to forgive you.

49
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,772
Even if I re-think it a thousand times...

50
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,819
I can't forgive you.

51
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,148
Hurry and sleep.

52
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,983
Once you wake up,

53
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,569
your headache will go away

54
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,696
and you'll become a police officer.

55
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,950
No!

56
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:39,686
There was...

57
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,068
something I had
to tell your older brother.

58
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:51,907
To please...

59
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,869
To please not die.

60
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,333
Not die

61
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,543
and live.

62
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,631
To live and suffer from guilt
for the rest of your life.

63
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,221
Like me.

64
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,611
You can never die.

65
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,824
Seo Hae-an.

66
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,507
I just...

67
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,928
wanted to be like others

68
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,847
and have a normal life.

69
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,683
If I desire it earnestly,

70
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,436
then it should've been granted.

71
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,149
Don't try to reason yourself.

72
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,448
Everything's an excuse.

73
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,046
Dong-joo.

74
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,174
Everything's over now.

75
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,769
I'm sorry.

76
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,064
I should've protected you.

77
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,984
You've done enough.

78
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
Thank you.

I'll come by later.

Seo Hae-an.

He won't talk.

85
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm sorry, sir.

86
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,091
We plan to re-investigate

87
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,759
the Bongsu market accident.

88
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,805
Sure.

89
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,015
I apologize.

ILSAN WEST POLICE STATION

91
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm sorry, Dong-joo.

92
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,997
I've done something I shouldn't have done.

93
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
I'm really...

94
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,463
really sorry.

95
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,851
I didn't come here
to hear that you're sorry.

96
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,400
I'm here because
I have something to tell you.

97
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,200
Your older brother...

98
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,788
asked me to tell you this.

99
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,128
I don't know if you're doing this because
you want to hear something from me.

100
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,130
I'm the one who hit him. It's me.

101
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,716
So stop with the questions.

102
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,843
And get me cigarettes.

103
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,680
Don't you feel bad for Hae-an?

104
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,475
Do you know my younger brother?

105
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,938
Jeez.

106
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,232
What a small world.

107
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,109
Goodness.

108
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,444
Then,

109
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,281
can you tell Hae-an something for me?

110
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,957
That the person who made me like this,

111
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,208
isn't you.

112
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,876
It's myself.

113
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,963
So,

114
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,799
to not think about me

115
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,718
nor our father.

116
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,304
And to not feel sorry.

117
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,224
To not be afraid. And just...

118
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,977
to do whatever you want to do.

119
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,062
And live happily

120
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,316
without any worries.

121
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,698
To not let my words

122
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,869
stay in your heart for long.

123
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,414
I'll take all the burden with me.

124
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,085
So just live normally like others.

125
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,964
Please tell him that.

126
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,675
I beg you.

127
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,935
I beg you.

128
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,243
He knew that...

129
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,830
you became a police officer

130
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,124
and that you moved.

131
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,964
The stuff you said at the ICU,

132
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,468
he heard everything.

133
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,057
I thought that

134
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,353
I'd be happy now.

135
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,773
But I guess not.

136
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,713
Please just go now.

137
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,799
Think about me.

138
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,401
That day,

139
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,029
he said he's the one who drove

140
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,326
and that he's the one
who caused the accident.

141
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,788
He kept repeating that.

142
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,889
I have a favor to ask.

143
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,250
On the day of the accident,

144
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,253
my older brother

145
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,923
had a chip inserted in the black box.

146
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:19,701
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

147
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,999
Right after the accident,

148
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,334
I had it

149
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,003
taken out.

150
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,674
I didn't have the courage
to turn myself in

151
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,676
nor the courage to throw it away.

152
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,761
So I kept it.

153
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,225
Dong-joo,

154
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,396
can you turn it in for me?

155
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,176
Driving under influence,
murder on the run under the Special Act,

156
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,761
two deaths,

157
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,681
changing drivers, interference with
police in the execution of his duties,

158
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,016
lack of accountability
under the police oath,

159
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,726
and destruction of evidence.

160
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:14,023
Do you have anything to say?

161
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,738
There's...

162
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,035
someone I'd like to meet.

163
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,193
Why did you do it?

164
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,912
I said, why did you do it?

165
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,504
I'm sorry.

166
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,977
I'll live.

167
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,314
I won't die.

168
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,738
I'll suffer from guilt.

169
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,660
And live no matter what...

170
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:54,832
for the rest of my life.

171
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:35,915
Tae-hee.

172
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,583
You should eat.

173
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,213
I'll leave it in front of your door.

174
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,024
Goodness.

175
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,991
Tae-hee.

176
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,660
I bought an amazing samgyetang.

177
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,328
Eat it, okay?

178
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,020
Hey.

179
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,105
I made pork rice bowl.

180
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,357
You better eat this time.

181
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,786
What a brat.

182
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,580
Hey! Open the door.

183
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,165
Open up.

184
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,960
Darn it.

185
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,556
Hey!

186
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,308
At least chew some gum!

187
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,314
Tae-hee.

188
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,567
I bought a lottery ticket.

189
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:13,197
I'll only let you know when I win.

190
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,492
Then, you'll be so jealous.

191
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,078
What?

192
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,913
What the...?

193
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,499
Oh my God. Hey!

194
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,376
Tae-hee. Come out!

195
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,836
Hey! Oh my God!

196
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,088
Hey! The lottery...

197
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,756
I lost. Darn it.

198
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,042
Hi Dong-joo.

199
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,169
How are you feeling?

200
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,837
I'm good.

201
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,506
-What's with the flowers?
-Right. Here.

202
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,758
What?

203
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,721
They're beautiful, aren't they?
Flowers have the power to calm the mind.

204
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,557
They reduce stress
and increase the happiness index.

205
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,142
Is that so?

206
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,729
Wow, they smell so good!

207
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,607
Just looking at them makes me feel better.

208
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,233
Thank you.

209
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,446
Right. Can you give them to Tae-hee?

210
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,740
Right. Well...

211
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,409
Oh, I thought they were for me.

212
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,622
Dong-joo.

213
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,083
Do you want to come in?

214
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,423
No, I'll wait.

215
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,330
Tae-hee.

216
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,543
Tae-hee.

217
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:56,777
I'm sorry.

218
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,154
Why?

219
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,037
It's not because of you.

220
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,585
It's not your fault.

221
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,925
Thank you, Tae-hee.

222
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,303
It's so nice to be here with you.

223
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,388
I'm glad we're watching it together.

224
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,774
Wow, look at the stars.

225
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:52,703
FINAL WORDS OF GOOD-BYE

226
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,875
The weather is pretty chilly now.

227
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:12,514
Jeez.

228
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,601
Those fools.
In front of the elderly living alone...

229
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:19,188
Never mind.

230
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,732
I've declared not to marry.

231
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,360
I am voluntarily not marrying.

232
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,374
Michael.

233
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,544
STOP BY

234
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,880
-Sam-sam.
-What?

235
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,299
Uncle. Uncle.

236
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:49,176
-Sam-sam.
-I see.

237
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,803
Uncle and uncle.

238
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,477
I wanted to see you soon.

239
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:01,355
You've suffered a lot from the incident.

240
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:04,692
Jeez.

241
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,151
More than me,

242
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,822
Tae-hee is having hard time.

243
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,244
Still, my nephew seems to be very lucky.

244
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,371
He has Dong-joo.

245
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,915
The more I see her,
she seems like a good person.

246
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,835
He's got good luck!

247
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,962
More than that.

248
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,464
He hit a grand slam.

249
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,966
He changed his life with a grand slam.

250
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,428
You're over complementing her.

251
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,430
She's still

252
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,515
got a lot to learn.

253
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,434
By the way,

254
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,103
is there really such a thing as fate?

255
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:45,190
Originally, I didn't believe
in such a fantasy.

256
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,651
Is that why

257
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,319
you declared your non-marriage?

258
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,405
It doesn't mean that I'll never withdraw.

259
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,323
I didn't say that.

260
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,783
But...

261
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,785
even so,

262
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,662
you should still believe.

263
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,706
That it's destiny.

264
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,374
That it's love.

265
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,502
That it recognizes each other.

266
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,297
Just like us, sam-sam's?

267
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,258
Let's go all the way

268
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,344
to Silvertown together, okay?

269
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,679
-No.
-What?

270
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,600
What a miser.

271
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,738
I've prepared it
in a larger portion for you.

272
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,324
I feel like a lot of things
have been resolved.

273
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,034
Even if you, Stella,

274
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,535
don't have 80%,

275
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,704
you have at least 50% stake.

276
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,374
No, not at all.

277
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,381
Those hands...

278
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,010
Do you still think

279
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,638
they aren't a gift?

280
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,902
Who could be the last person?

281
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,613
The person who is destined

282
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,241
to meet Stella's hands.

283
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,995
Will you tell me
after I meet the last person?

284
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,040
The secret behind my hands.

285
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,170
What?

286
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,441
LARGE-SCALE FIRE IN THE 4-STORY BUILDING
OF BONGSU ELECTRIC IN SEOUL

287
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:15,090
21 PEOPLE DIE
IN BONGSU ELECTRIC BUILDING FIRE ACCIDENT

288
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,511
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:20,888
To work. I'll be back.

290
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,306
Oh, right.

291
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,349
Be safe.

292
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,941
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

293
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,693
This week has been really tough.

294
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,819
Same here.

295
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,237
It's been so tough.

296
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,489
Let's eat and cheer up.

297
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,244
Wow.

298
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,538
-It's delicious.
-Here.

299
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:47,956
For you too.

300
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,129
It's tasty.

301
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,214
It's even better with the meat.

302
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,800
I...

303
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,594
This morning,

304
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,055
I sent a gifticon to the Il-seob.

305
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,645
You don't nag anymore.

306
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,064
Whatever. Do as you like.

307
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:13,899
Sure!

308
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,278
It's Il-seob.

309
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,661
Thank you so much.

310
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,165
Hey. Go to work.

311
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,667
What about you?

312
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,543
I'm off today.

313
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:35,253
I only have afternoon lessons today.

314
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:36,838
Shall we go watch a movie together?

315
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,590
Period. Period.

316
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,552
"Thank you so much."

317
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,431
"Thank you so much."

318
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,516
Wow.

319
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,601
What the?

320
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,020
-Hello.
-"Thank you so much?"

321
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,105
Excuse me?

322
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,440
What does it mean
when a guy says "thank you so much?"

323
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,526
-What?
-"Thank....

324
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,070
You... So...

325
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,030
Much."

326
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,407
"Thank you so much?"

327
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,787
Well...

328
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,038
That is...

329
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:11,748
That just means thank you.

330
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:13,667
That's it?

331
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,007
Then, what's with
the two period's in the end?

332
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,383
There are two periods.

333
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,344
What does it mean
when a guy uses two periods?

334
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,554
Let's grab food?

335
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,680
Or let's go drink?

336
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,849
He's hitting on me, right?

337
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:32,310
Should I go for it?

338
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:37,983
Go for it.

339
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,746
I'm here to fight head-on.

340
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,919
I think you've been doing it all along.

341
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,089
So you know.

342
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,550
That's worth the effort.

343
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:07,721
Well then, have a great day today.

344
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:14,853
Hey, granddaughter.

345
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,780
Have you had...

346
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,075
lunch?

347
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,878
Tae-hee!

348
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,546
Hey!

349
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,050
Oh my God. Oh my God!

350
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,760
What's with you? What is it?

351
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,762
1000 clients.

352
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,228
Hey, you brat.

353
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,188
What's with your reaction?

354
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,524
Aren't 100,000 people
the default these days?

355
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:04,444
We're in the Bongsu district.
These are all our actual customers.

356
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,363
That's exactly what I'm saying.

357
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,453
Jeez. I'm talking about
hiring more people.

358
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,746
What?

359
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,625
Why?

360
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,586
You're

361
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,422
staying here?

362
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,298
KIM HAE-YEON - CHEER

363
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,303
So, you're really

364
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,514
staying here, right?

365
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,560
Where else would I go?

366
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,188
Yeah, exactly.

367
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,190
Go ahead. Keep working.

368
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,778
Hey.

369
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,239
It's not time for us to be idle like this.

370
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,615
We've got a lot to do.

371
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,164
A DIME A JOB
CHAT

372
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:06,673
Anyway,

373
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:07,924
we should

374
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,427
focus on our VIP clients.

375
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,480
Jeez.

376
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,694
What the?

377
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,362
What...

378
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,409
Hi Dong-joo.

379
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,584
Why is everyone here?

380
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:44,836
Dad?

381
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,338
Jeez. My eyes are burning.

382
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,883
-Dad--
-I asked because I had to make kimchi!

383
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:53,178
-Why? What?
-Who makes kimchi nowadays?

384
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,429
I like making it myself.

385
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,306
Why do you make just kimchi every time?

386
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,725
Even if you run out of rice,
you should never run out of kimchi.

387
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,852
Are you trying to share it
with the whole neighborhood?

388
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,938
I wish he did.

389
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,774
I'll get some kimchi later too.

390
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:06,900
Yes, of course.

391
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,985
But where's the cabbage?

392
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,862
It's in the bathroom.

393
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,697
Bathroom. Tae-hee, let's go.

394
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:13,782
Okay.

395
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,503
Dad.

396
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:30,340
I made 70 bundles last year, but it wasn't
enough. So I'm making 200 this year.

397
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,466
Goodness.

398
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,593
Last year, I bought pickled cabbage,

399
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,053
but I couldn't eat it
because it was too bitter.

400
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,515
I don't think they used the right salt.

401
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,559
Squeeze the water out completely
and bring them out.

402
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,644
Yes, sir.

403
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:45,981
Goodness.

404
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,525
They look delicious.

405
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:51,152
Did you grind all the red pepper powder?

406
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,905
Don't you know how important
red pepper powder is when making kimchi?

407
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,156
No, and I don't care.

408
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,741
I wish you knew.

409
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,994
I cleaned them one by one.

410
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,496
There was so much dust in the peppers.

411
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,624
You never know where they come from
when you buy them in markets.

412
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,460
Why not plant pepper
and cabbages and farm?

413
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:09,879
Why couldn't I think of that?

414
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,265
Let's go.

415
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,474
You're really using everything, right?

416
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:24,352
Of course. We need to finish them today.

417
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,688
So we can eat them next year.

418
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,525
-They're heavy, right?
-No, not at all.

419
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:32,485
-I'm serious.
-Jeez.

420
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,615
Of course, I'm the only one working.

421
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,367
Did you come to play?

422
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:41,536
It's so unfair.

423
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,288
-What is?
-Where should I put this?

424
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,094
That's good.

425
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,430
Here.

426
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:06,353
That's tasty.

427
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,356
Now, for you.

428
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,236
Wow.

429
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,738
-That's delicious.
-I know, right?

430
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,290
Here is a big one for you, boss.

431
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,336
Wow.

432
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,962
Sir.

433
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,173
Do you have makgeolli?

434
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,009
Hey, I'm Baek Dong-joo's dad.

435
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:41,513
It's so delicious.

436
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,264
Cheers.

437
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:54,526
Even though I was worried that you
would get sick after making this kimchi,

438
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,403
knowing that I'm being greedy,

439
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,030
I can't stop
because I want to eat this together.

440
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,074
We are honored.

441
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:05,286
And since we're healthy young men,
we don't have to worry about body aches.

442
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,788
We don't even get the flu.

443
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,706
I was discharged as an army sergeant.

444
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:09,958
-I see.
-I see.

445
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,001
I'm from the 370th of the military.

446
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,378
I'm from the marines.

447
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,380
Of course!

448
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:16,923
You've passed as my son-in-law.

449
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,300
Excuse me?

450
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,137
What are you saying?

451
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,598
You can't fool me.

452
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,267
You fool.

453
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,397
How'd you find out?

454
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,565
Who knows?

455
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,695
-Here. Eat up, boss.
-Thank you.

456
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,740
I'm looking forward
to more good information in the future.

457
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,785
I see.

458
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,790
Eat up first.

459
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,334
You can take your call here.

460
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:04,888
Hello?

461
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,348
My daughter has fainted.

462
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,267
So I need to go now.

463
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,894
Can you take my shift?

464
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,979
I see.

465
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,398
Please take over for me.

466
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:18,026
My wife is in dialysis right now.
So it's just me.

467
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:19,861
I see.

468
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,408
Jeez. My friend is hurt.

469
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:26,659
I should go. What do you think?

470
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,703
What? Who?

471
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:31,998
Well...

472
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,667
-Seok-ho.
-I see.

473
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,252
Do you have to go?

474
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,546
He has a wife and four daughters.

475
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,048
His wife is ill.

476
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,258
Don't wait up.
I don't think I'll be back tonight.

477
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,593
-Dad.
-Yes?

478
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,513
You're not going to Seok-ho, are you?

479
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:53,603
Well...

480
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:55,188
Girlfriend?

481
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,482
Stop talking nonsense.

482
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,859
-I'll drop you off.
-Let's go together.

483
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,945
Goodness. There's no need to.

484
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:05,823
Since you're here,
I hope you just enjoy the food.

485
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,283
Go ahead and eat.

486
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:08,451
Well...

487
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,828
Jeez. He's in such a hurry.

488
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:13,915
-Go ahead and eat. I'll be back.
-Okay.

489
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,299
It's really fine.
You were in the middle of eating.

490
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,260
It's totally fine.

491
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,599
Well...

492
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,561
I should've told you sooner.

493
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,146
I'm sorry.

494
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,065
Jeez. Don't be sorry at all.

495
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:44,153
Since Dong-joo was a kid,

496
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,698
I've imagined it a countless times.

497
00:47:48,408 --> 00:47:49,409
About what?

498
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,703
I wondered what kind of a guy she'd meet.

499
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:54,497
Would I get jealous?

500
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,418
I would get furious
and wake up in the middle of the night.

501
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,007
I've imagined that tens
of thousands of times,

502
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:08,094
but seeing you and Dong-joo together,

503
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:09,429
I like it.

504
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,349
I feel very relieved.

505
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:18,021
She's never showed her true feelings.

506
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,231
She's used to pretend she's okay,

507
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:22,650
even if she wasn't.

508
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:26,863
So I always had that in my mind.

509
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,118
A roof is not enough for me
to shelter her from the rain.

510
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,371
I can't be that cozy blanket
to keep her warm.

511
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,043
I want her to receive greater
love outside of my arms,

512
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,172
instead of being loved in my arms.

513
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,716
That being said,

514
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,178
I'm saying this to definitely burden you.

515
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,307
Please make Dong-joo laugh a lot,

516
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,351
and give her a lot of love.

517
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:58,478
That's all I ask.

518
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,022
I will keep that in mind.

519
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,524
Thank you.

520
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,445
Thank you today,
and thank you in the future too.

521
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,573
Oh, drop me off
right after that intersection.

522
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,367
Yes, sir.

523
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:17,121
Well...

524
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,416
Are you going to keep
working at the apartment

525
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,502
a secret?

526
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,754
Well, that...

527
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,674
I get greedy while doing it,

528
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:29,592
so I can't quit easily.

529
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:34,430
If Dongju knew about it,
I think she'd tell me to quit right away.

530
00:49:35,223 --> 00:49:38,142
I made you feel awkward putting
you in the middle, right? I'm sorry.

531
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,977
No, not at all.

532
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,491
Jeez. You must be exhausted.

533
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:56,703
-Sir.
-Yes?

534
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:57,912
Just a minute.

535
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,497
Yes?

536
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,046
Well, here.

537
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,342
Goodness. You didn't have to.

538
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:12,885
Jeez. Thank you.

539
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,470
Thank you so much.

540
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,014
Thank you.

541
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,808
Hey, Mr. Baek. Hurry!

542
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,518
-I'm in a hurry.
-Go ahead.

543
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,103
-Hurry.
-Okay.

544
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,438
Hurry and go.

545
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,819
Jeez. It's cold. Hurry and go.

546
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,801
Oh.

547
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,137
Sir.

548
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,431
-Have some.
-No, it's fine.

549
00:50:58,514 --> 00:50:59,682
Have some.

550
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,851
Thank you.

551
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,229
-Thank you. Go in safely.
-Okay.

552
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,398
Jeez.

553
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:23,623
How come our baby always
wants to eat only roasted sweet potatoes?

554
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,208
I know, right?

555
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,585
Here. Have some.

556
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,924
She shouldn't
look like sweet potatoes, though.

557
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:48,397
MY SWEET DAUGHTER

558
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:49,941
Dad.

559
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,442
Is everything okay?

560
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,778
-What?
-Seok-ho.

561
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,073
Yes, of course. He's okay.

562
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,660
-What the...?
-Are you done eating already?

563
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,371
I got home a while ago.

564
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,082
Let's not make kimchi next year.

565
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,333
We need to again.

566
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:08,918
Jeez. You never listen.

567
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:13,965
The oysters are in the fridge,
and I left the bossam on the table.

568
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,592
Don't forget it.

569
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,927
Okay.

570
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,762
Okay.

571
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,277
A DIME A JOB

572
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,279
Goodness.

573
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,907
Hey, I bet all the kimchi
in this town tastes the same.

574
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:41,325
I know, right?

575
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,078
I think we made 1000 bundles
of kimchi these past few days.

576
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,164
Goodness. We were
basically a kimchi factory.

577
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,458
We didn't even have a day of rest.

578
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,543
Boss.

579
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,211
Seriously,

580
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,214
why don't we go on vacation
during the kimchi-making season?

581
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,476
Jeez. Hey.

582
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,563
Look. There's no way we can rest.

583
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,649
I know this was my idea

584
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,778
to give our customers love,
peace, and happiness.

585
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,866
It's too good to just stay like this.

586
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:26,037
Shouldn't more people enjoy our service?

587
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,289
How?

588
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,373
Expanding business.

589
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:30,625
So how do we do that?

590
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,585
-We need to get investments.
-From who?

591
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,420
Let's go

592
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:38,466
more global with a sense of ownership.

593
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,474
Does that half mean "help?"

594
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,353
-Then, what is that?
-That means half, like half of something.

595
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,438
This is help, you fool.

596
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,191
What did you study in Noryangjin?

597
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,359
It changed?

598
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,089
Can I see you for a second?

599
00:54:35,356 --> 00:54:38,401
I wondered if the day would come
when we could see each other comfortably.

600
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:39,485
That's today.

601
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,449
I'm going to America.

602
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,620
So I can study more.

603
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,125
That's good for you.

604
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,461
You've always wanted to study abroad.

605
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,638
Here.

606
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:08,931
It's not a gift.

607
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:10,307
It belongs to you.

608
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,330
I found it while I was packing my things.

609
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,469
Aren't you thinking about coming back?

610
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:20,336
Yes.

611
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,672
I got on the wrong bus, so I'm waiting.

612
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,633
When will you be here?

613
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,967
Jeez. I'll be there quickly.

614
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,928
How'd you get on the wrong bus?

615
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,097
Why weren't you paying attention?

616
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,807
-Dad.
-Dad?

617
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,184
What do you mean "dad?"

618
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,686
-Hey, hold on. Hang up.
-Hey.

619
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,356
Dad!

620
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,652
Dad!

621
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:48,072
-I can't that day. I got an order.
-Dad!

622
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,075
I'm available the next day.

623
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,284
Yes, of course.

624
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,287
Why can't he hear me?

625
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,064
Jeez. Just leave it.

626
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,984
No, that's fine. I can do it.

627
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,444
No, I'll get it.

628
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,529
Thank you, sir.

629
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,738
When's your baby due?

630
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,365
It's one week late.

631
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,658
Goodness.

632
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,996
They say that if you exercise and move
your body, the baby will come out faster.

633
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:39,290
-So I'm moving a lot.
-I see.

634
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,459
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

635
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,628
-Thank you.
-Sure.

636
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:46,505
-Go in safely.
-Okay.

637
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,716
Goodness. Careful.

638
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:54,513
Sir, should I put a label on this?

639
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:55,848
Are you throwing it out?

640
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,434
-Yes.
-It still looks good, though.

641
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,103
Could I have it?

642
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:04,273
But it's been used a lot.

643
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,817
Jeez. This looks new to me.

644
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,820
-You can leave it. I'll do it.
-Sure.

645
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,697
-Thank you.
-Sure.

646
00:58:41,894 --> 00:58:43,062
Dong-joo.

647
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,396
Dong-joo.

648
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:46,398
Dong-joo.

649
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,942
Dong-joo. Hey.

650
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,489
Well...

651
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,828
I was going to tell you.

652
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:03,832
I'm sorry.

653
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,775
Father, did you know about this?

654
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:31,360
No.

655
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,738
I really didn't know.

656
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:39,576
I'm not trying to blame you, Father.

657
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,538
I just feel so stupid.

658
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:45,124
I'm just upset.

659
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,546
He thinks I'm studying.

660
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:54,550
I had no idea he's been working
that small guard post to support me.

661
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,885
Stella.

662
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,595
I want to end this.

663
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,682
I want to stop lying to my dad.

664
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,437
I want to go back home to live with him.

665
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,317
You should.

666
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,133
-Dal-shik.
-Yes.

667
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,891
I'm glad to see you so energetic.

668
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,936
I wonder why daughters worry so much.

669
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,648
She probably thinks
I'm doing this because of her.

670
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,359
I'm still young

671
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:54,777
and healthy.

672
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,861
Exactly.

673
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,072
Fifty isn't considered old anymore.

674
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,783
You still have a long way
to go to grow up.

675
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,244
Look at you being butt-hurt.

676
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,746
You're butt-hurt, aren't you?

677
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,123
Still,

678
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,833
don't overwork yourself.

679
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,002
You're still running the factory.

680
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,088
Jeez. The factory isn't a concern.

681
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,633
What are you going to do
with all that money?

682
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,267
Dongju, have you thought about
the altar design?

683
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,644
Right.

684
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,440
-Here.
-Okay.

685
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,614
Wow. Your idea is amazing.

686
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,244
Complaints came in
because of the ATM machine

687
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,371
and the location of the donation envelope.

688
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,624
So let's think about
where to change the location.

689
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:51,708
Yes, sir.

690
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:55,754
Also, you've accumulated
a lot of days off.

691
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,757
Use them before the end
of this year, or they go to waste.

692
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,140
-Sir.
-Yes?

693
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,562
I have something to tell you.

694
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:14,565
Sure.

695
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,733
Well...

696
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:23,365
I think I should quit.

697
01:02:28,871 --> 01:02:30,122
I'm going to study.

698
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,086
Sure.

699
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,173
How long can you work until?

700
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:47,806
Thank you.

701
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,154
I'm going to do what my dad wants.

702
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,782
I registered for the course

703
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,577
and told our team leader.

704
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:13,123
He asked me to stay
until he hired someone new,

705
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,083
so I said yes.

706
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,838
There's only one person left,

707
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,299
so I'm just going to finish it

708
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:24,426
and then quit.

709
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,561
Also,

710
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,525
I'm planning on moving back home.

711
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,281
Well...

712
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,910
You can't.

713
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,704
This is what I want to say,

714
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,711
but I think it's better for you
to be by your father's side.

715
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,260
I'll just visit you more often.

716
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:16,478
Jeez. The wind is strong.

717
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:25,737
You must be coming back from the market.

718
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:28,615
-Yes.
-I hope to hear some good news today.

719
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,784
-I wish so too.
-Jeez.

720
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,327
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

721
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,456
Jeez.

722
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,230
Move!

723
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,849
A DIME A JOB

724
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,035
I wish you'd stop.

725
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,454
Stop worrying about me,
and take care of yourself.

726
01:05:57,537 --> 01:05:59,289
You're all grown up now, Dong-joo.

727
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,457
I got a reply.

728
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,834
I want to discuss
investing in your company.

729
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,711
Let's go to Pan-gyo!

730
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,048
I have an errand request for you too.

731
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,467
Dong-joo, you have to be happy.

732
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,427
Please take care of Dong-joo.

733
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,513
What should I do tomorrow?

734
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:18,016
I will do it. I must do it myself.
