1
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,078
Baek Dong-joo ssi.

2
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,171
They're pretty.

3
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,300
They're great.

4
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,678
Your hands.

5
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,526
Wanna go get some beer?

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,198
Just one glass.

7
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,705
You always hold it in like that?

8
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,960
If you can't cuss at their faces,
try it on me.

9
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,714
You don't know how?

10
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,257
I'll teach you.

11
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,467
Choose one.

12
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,803
A satisfying one? A thick one?

13
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,055
-A feisty one?
-What would--

14
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,266
What would what?
It's better than just sitting there.

15
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,768
Okay, repeat after me.

16
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,103
-Ssi--
-What would that accomplish?

17
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,314
Change what my hands do?

18
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:54,949
No, it wouldn't.

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,411
But someone had the chance
to meet his son

20
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,913
and another person

21
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,667
was able to give his family
his secret stash of money.

22
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,545
Without your hands,

23
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,925
Apple mom's husband wouldn't have
made it back alive either.

24
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:20,683
What you do is amazing,

25
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,768
and I envy you.

26
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,729
Ridiculous.

27
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,403
You don't know what homework is? Jeez...

28
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,030
I'm really

29
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,701
just forcing myself to do it
because it's homework.

30
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,160
If it is, you don't have to.

31
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,413
Why struggle so hard?

32
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,832
If you put it off and not finish,

33
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,167
all you'll have is
a lecture from the teacher.

34
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,003
Get a beating and move on.

35
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,008
Why do you try so hard
if it's just homework?

36
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,177
While holding in everything like that.

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,186
That's why it's hard.

38
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,822
You couldn't tell anyone.

39
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,366
I bet it was lonely.

40
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:44,600
That daughter-in-law ajumma
is so annoying.

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,518
Ditch their Departure tomorrow!

42
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,479
-Ditch it!
-Ditch it!

43
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,064
I give you the permission.

44
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,776
-You're terrible!
-Why did you hit me?!

45
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,237
I already don't wanna go,
why are you being a bad influence?

46
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,823
If I don't go, it's all your fault.

47
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,368
How dare you talk to me like that?

48
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,706
You said you were 25, I'm 30. 30!

49
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,459
-So annoying.
-What's annoying?

50
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,170
-Annoying!
-Annoying Shmannoying!

51
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,051
Man, never in my life have I...

52
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,345
From there to here

53
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,389
how many kilos?

54
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,443
Baek Dong-joo ssi, wake up.

55
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,114
Come on, wake up.

56
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,117
Wow, so many stairs.

57
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,785
I can't do this.

58
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,246
This place has too many stairs.

59
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,752
Wake up.

60
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,588
Stop the weird noise.
What's the pass code?

61
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,924
Huh? What did you say?

62
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,178
-One two three four...
-One two three four?

63
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,993
I'm so exhausted.

64
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,259
What?

65
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,011
Why are you here?

66
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,641
-Where am I? How did I get in here?
-This is my...

67
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,605
Did we

68
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,607
sleep together?

69
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,822
-No, we didn't sleep together.
-We didn't?

70
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,573
No. Nothing happened.

71
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,075
Thank goodness...

72
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,287
Then... Yeah.

73
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,629
Dong-joo ssi!

75
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,842
Hey, Dong-joo ssi!

76
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,010
-What do we do?
-How should I know?

77
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,137
What do we do?

78
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,931
-Dong-joo ssi, just now...
-Oh God.

79
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,142
...you were screaming, right?

80
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,688
-Open up. It's Seo Hae-an from next door.
-What do I do?

81
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,275
-No, it was nothing.
-What do you mean?

82
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,360
I know I heard a scream.

83
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,573
There was a cockroach in my room.

84
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,991
Oh man, a cockroach?

85
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,286
Well, open up so I can

86
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,745
kill that son of a gun.

87
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,455
Tell him you caught it.

88
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,251
I caught it! It's all good now.

89
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,380
But I didn't want
Dong-joo ssi's hand getting all bloody.

90
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,007
No, it's fine.

91
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,427
-Is everything really all right?
-Of course.

92
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,387
Dong-joo ssi.

93
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,267
From now on, for something like that,
dispatch this Seo Hae-an right away.

94
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,060
-Okay?
-Okay.

95
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,854
-Dong-joo ssi.
-Yes?

96
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,901
Yes, thank you.

97
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,073
"Good morning," my butt.

98
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,117
One sec.

99
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,706
Okay, he's gone. You can go.

100
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,130
Who is "Uncle Hyang-bok?"

101
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,805
Your call has been
forwarded to the voice mail--

102
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,682
This kid, for God's sakes!

103
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,852
Seongnim, what's wrong
at this ungodly hour?

104
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,898
Oh. Have you seen my nephew?

105
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,859
Tae-hee seongnim
didn't come home last night?

106
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,444
This kid...

107
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,614
The owner's name is Hyang-bok?

108
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,075
-Yeah.
-Not like they can hear us.

109
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,535
I think he's trying to
get out of cleaning.

110
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,247
You getting that suspicion too?

111
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,540
What a great household this is!

112
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,002
He's really gotta grow up.

113
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,589
I would like to be of some help, but

114
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,424
I have to go to work.

115
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,592
It's fine.

116
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,428
You're better than my own nephew.

117
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,265
This bastard...

118
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:27,901
What now?

119
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,321
What else can we do but wait?

120
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,615
I have to go. I got work.

121
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,036
Go ahead. I'll leave in a bit.

122
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,624
I have to take a shower.

123
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,673
The nephew is off to who-knows-where
doing who-knows-what all night

124
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,883
and the uncle is sweeping the stairs.

125
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,386
I'm going to be 40 soon and--

126
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,179
Ow, my back.

127
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:02,060
For Goodness sakes,
why are there so many stairs?

128
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,397
I should sell all this and just move to
an apartment or something.

129
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:14,865

You there?

131
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,871
Where'd he go?

132
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,721
Baek Dong-joo.

133
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,473
Don't chicken out!

134
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,451
Director.

135
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,203
Yes.

136
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,916
I hope you're not misunderstanding.

137
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,252
My child is just so wild.

138
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,045
He's clueless about everything.

139
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,090
Please don't get the wrong idea.

140
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,092
You don't know how grateful I am.

141
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,389
Thanks to you, I was able to send off
my mother-in-law properly.

142
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,850
Thank you very much.

143
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,688
Really. Bless you.

144
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,650
I'll keep your name card.

145
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,570
I would love to see you again
when there's another tragedy.

146
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,783
Not seeing each other again

147
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,118
would be the best.

148
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,911
Right.

149
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,723
I'm not a chicken!

150
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,111
Having fun?

151
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,951
Can you afford to be
smiling right now?

152
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,329
Get your crap together.

153
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,164
What's wrong with you?

154
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,003
Where the hell were you all night?!

155
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,381
-I'm 30 now.
-Really.

156
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,842
I'm your uncle.

157
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,186
You're laughing?

Hey, baby girl.

Is Seoul giving an award to you yet?

00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,428
You give your dad work to do
in case he's too bored doing nothing.

168
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,015
You said you were coming
so I bought fruit.

169
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,933
They're all going bad now.
I'll have so much fun.

170
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,477
Dad, why are you so sarcastic?

171
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,856
You should have just eaten them.
Why did you keep them for so long?

172
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,608
I'm eating well. I don't need them.

173
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,278
Yeah, right. It's not easy
to have fruits when you live alone.

174
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,405
Oh, there's something else here!

175
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:09,409
I got a big package of belt fish
since you probably don't eat them

176
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,871
but wow, they look perfect for
some stray cats now.

177
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,582
Okay, okay. I'll be home soon!

178
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:21,046
Where else? I'm at the cram school.

179
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,306
What brings you here?

180
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,934
For a Mass of Remembrance.
Then it reminded me of you.

181
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,025
I have

182
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,819
gone back to that house.

183
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,698
A Dime A Job.

184
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,492
Did the man move out?

185
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,868
Have I misheard?

186
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,579
Wasn't it the owner's house?

187
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,790
That's right.

188
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,542
He apologized.

189
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:00,919
Shockers.

190
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,464
-Right after going berserk on you?
-I know, right?

191
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,841
But then I found out that he

192
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,344
-went to the Incheon Bridge.
-What?

193
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,222
He said it was
weighing on his mind or whatever.

194
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,349
Anyways,

195
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,727
he saved our chief mourner.
I don't think he's that bad of a person.

196
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,896
What an unpredictable person.

197
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,442
"I couldn't hear it. Because of you."

198
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,986
That weighed on his mind
the most, apparently.

199
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:34,703
Maybe he can't handle self-blame.
Some people have it bad.

200
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,123
Why did that weigh on his mind?

201
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,667
Not sure.

202
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,128
Anything else?

203
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,714
They're pretty.

204
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,424
They're great.

205
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:50,635
Your hands.

206
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,345
You couldn't tell anyone.

207
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,849
I bet it was lonely.

208
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,688
Nope.

209
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,149
-Nothing.
-I see.

210
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,484
It's not great, but better news.

211
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,487
At least you don't have to be anxious.

212
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,906
And you can do your homework in peace.

213
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,409
If it is, you don't have to.

214
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,370
-Yes.
-However,

215
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,664
if he's being mean ever again,

216
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,583
uncle will not let it slide.

217
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,209
Please let me know.

218
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,545
You've heard of my past life, right?

219
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,797
They said I was a warrior
that protected the king.

220
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,927
Slicing, stabbing, dicing. No joke.

221
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,596
-It's dad.
-Oh God.

222
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,055
Is he near?

223
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,851
-Is he watching us from somewhere?
-No, he said he was home on call earlier.

224
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,022
Hi, Dad.

225
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,859
I told you. The cram school.

226
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,614
Huh? Where are you, Dad?

227
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,533
-Right now?
-Oh, no.

228
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,161
Okay. Got it.

229
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,915
-Uncle!
-We don't have to both die!

230
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,042
No, he's at Noryangjin.

231
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,547
What the hell am I supposed to do?!

232
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,674
What about your clothes?

233
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,301
Dong-joo, clothes!

234
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,804
Just get me any clothes on the hangers.

235
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes, bag too.

236
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,723
To Noryangjin, quickly!

237
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,475
Swift, accurate, perfect, thorough!

238
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,061
Quickly, please! Pass code is 1234.

239
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,562
Swift, accurate, perfect, thorough!

240
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,226
Dude!

241
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,068
FIRST PLACE
CIVIL EXAMINATION CRAM SCHOOL

242
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,450
This kid. What happened to "be here soon?"

243
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,884
For God's sakes, man.

244
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,556
For real.

245
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:01,492
Wait.

246
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,748
I'm so sorry,
but can you move forward, please?

247
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,458
Sorry.

248
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,466
I thought I was gonna die!

249
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,051
What's wrong with you?

250
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,639
Wait, your bag!

251
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,563
Wait for me!

252
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:34,901
Dong-joo ssi, take your bag. Your bag--

253
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,865
What am I doing here?

254
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,538
Oh, my heart.

255
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,291
-Hey, your bag.
-Thank you.

256
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,253
-I'll be going now.
-Yes, thank you.

257
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,338
Dong-joo!

258
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,011
Oh, Dad!

259
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,639
You didn't show up
so I was going to the--

260
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,022
Are you by chance...

261
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,072
Oh man!

262
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,573
Oh man.

263
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:23,950
Hello.

264
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,243
Hello!

265
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,496
How do you two...

266
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,000
How do you two...

267
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,460
Oh.

268
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,296
I went to

269
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,798
Your mom, and...

270
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,349
I can't believe how small this world is!

271
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,728
Who would have known you live
in the same building as Dong-joo?

272
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,896
I was really shocked too.

273
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,527
You two look really close to each other.

274
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,321
All the way in Noryangjin together?

275
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,701
I also started prepping for civil jobs.

276
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,245
Is that so?

277
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,622
Good for you!

278
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,625
Studying needs a friend
to not get burnt out.

279
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,795
Give him some information.
You said it's important.

280
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,298
-Of course!
-She's helping a lot.

281
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,799
I see.

282
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,889
But how did you two
recognize each other right away?

283
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,853
Didn't you meet just the one time
you were at mom's?

284
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,858
Actually, I have an ability.

285
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,152
I never forget someone I meet.

286
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,653
Oh man!

287
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:47,158
Why would I need to meet him more?
He's a tall and handsome guy.

288
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,373
Who's there, by the way?

289
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,049
Is this all the sides you got?
We should have ordered more.

290
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,760
-We eat like this here and become...
-There's nothing to eat.

291
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:10,681
...rank 9, rank 7, rank 5, police officers
and firefighters, and everything.

292
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,518
So don't come with all those fruits.
I'm eating well.

293
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,019
Good try, kid.

294
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,022
You don't even eat apples,
so you don't have to peel them.

295
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,275
-They come peeled and cut at stores now.
-That's not the same.

296
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,443
It's so much better.

297
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,654
-I'm gonna get sulky.
-Okay.

298
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,702
TEAM LEADER
IM IL-SEOB

299
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,207
Who's "Team leader Im Il-seob?"

300
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,917
-Huh?
-Why didn't you answer?

301
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,545
Who was that?

302
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,840
-I... It's--
-Do you know "Team leader Kim Mi-yeong?"

303
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:47,593
-Who?
-They spam call the heck out of you.

304
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,137
I think I've heard of it.

305
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,972
Kim Mi-yeong is gone

306
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,474
and now there's an Im Il-seob,
as they say.

307
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:54,725
Yes.

308
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,061
I also have it saved, so I don't answer.

309
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,022
-See? Im Il-seob.
-I see.

310
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,068
Im Il-seob, huh...

311
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,370
Why don't you tell me stuff like this?

312
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,248
I also need to know
so I don't answer them.

313
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,169
-You should tell him.
-Okay, I'll let you know.

314
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,753
You always tell me late.

315
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,006
MANAGER
SHIM KYU-TAEK

316
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,347
Manager?

317
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,644
Why aren't you answering it?

318
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,854
Manager?

319
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,273
Oh man, wrong pipe.

320
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,942
It's the memorial park, right?

321
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,155
There's a promotion on
management fees right now.

322
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:53,784
They call and say 5% off if you do
five years' worth in one cash payment.

323
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,165
-No wonder I kept getting calls from them.
-That's correct.

324
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,751
I should call back later.

325
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,389
NORYANGJIN CUPBOP STREET
FRESH AIR SHELTER

326
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,476
-You said your name is Kim Tae-hee, right?
-Yes, sir.

327
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,311
It was good to meet you today.

328
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,273
You've been saying that
for the past few minutes now!

329
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:27,109
-Please go now.
-Okay. See you around.

330
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:34,325
When you have time later,
let's go for a drink.

331
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,369
-Of course.
-It was nice to meet you.

332
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,538
-Father. Please leave.
-I get it. I'm leaving now.

333
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,377
-So, later--
-Please.

334
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,796
-Get along, you two.
-Yes, sir.

335
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,756
-I know. I'm leaving.
-Bye!

336
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,550
-Take care, sir.
-See you later.

337
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:08,276
I think my heart and liver
moved a little out of position.

338
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,861
Thanks.

339
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,784
Why were you so scared?
You were almost shaking.

340
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,161
Who was shaki-- Me?

341
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,914
I saved your life, you know.

342
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,582
Kim Tae-hee.

343
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,835
Don't chicken out.

344
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,628
Chicken...

345
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,590
Lord, help me.

346
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,894
How did you choose your job?

347
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,567
I don't have that many skills.

348
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,948
Everything other people have,
a university diploma

349
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,992
TOEIC scores, certificates.

350
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,952
But I don't even have
a driver's license.

351
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,413
But this job

352
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,665
requires no special skills,

353
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:05,791
gets me insurances,

354
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,877
is full time, and has no retirement.

355
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,879
So I was like, "Nice!" and started

356
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,715
I didn't know I had an ability like that.

357
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:17,511
This is so much different from the
Baek Dong-joo I imagined as a kid.

358
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,889
What did you imagine as a kid?

359
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,769
Getting a gold medal at the Olympics?

360
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:27,813
You played sports?

361
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,195
Table Tennis.

362
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,990
I would have never imagined. Wow.

363
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:41,577
How about you, how did you start
A Dime A Job?

364
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:46,749
Because of uncle.

365
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,419
How about before that?

366
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,717
I served in the military.

367
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,221
You went really late.

368
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:03,974
Somehow, yes.

369
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,366
This is Omija ju.

370
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,660
Bloody red, it looks nice.

371
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,078
It's good for you.

372
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,832
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

373
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,836
Man, that's strong!

374
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,633
You think you can fool me again?
You didn't drink any of that.

375
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,511
People would say Lee Tae-baek
came back to life.

376
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,096
I tell you time after time.

377
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,723
I never drank, and I've never been drunk.

378
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,517
So show me how you fare.

379
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,977
There should be a day later.

380
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,311
If only.

381
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,690
Dong-joo ssi is back home,

382
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,651
so please let it slide. It's a great day.

383
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,404
And you should know.

384
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:05,327
I'd like to officially start, Seo Hae-an
and Baek Dong-joo Hook-up Project.

385
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,498
Seong-nim, help me out here.

386
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,000
You're starting again.

387
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,960
-Why would I?
-What the...!

388
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:17,715
Trying to get by without recognizing
the person filling up the vacant room?

389
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,009
Don't you know that
she's back thanks to me?

390
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,635
-No idea.
-Wow.

391
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:23,220
I,

392
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,847
this Seo Hae-an,

393
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:29,143
didn't give up and
persistently convinced her to come back.

394
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,603
Sincerity pays off.

395
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,355
-Are you certain?
-Why wouldn't I be?

396
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,109
-Was that it?
-Yep.

397
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:42,656
I did think it was weird that
she just came back suddenly.

398
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:48,704
I heard she left
the day she met my nephew.

399
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,082
I wondered if something happened
between them? A fight?

400
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,710
And they made up and came back?

401
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,004
Seong-nim, for real!

402
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:01,050
Why would you even imagine such a thing!

403
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,970
Fights don't happen that easily.

404
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:11,018
It needs things like interest, love,
expectations for two people to fight.

405
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,770
They have none of that.

406
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,690
Why would they waste
their emotion and time like that?

407
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:20,236
What are you so riled up about?
Eat your ramyeon.

408
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,698
You say some
weird things sometimes, Seong-nim.

409
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,826
What's this?

410
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,746
Oh, that?

411
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,751
Tae-hee got that from working four hours
at the Bongsu Apartment gardens.

412
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,127
That idiot.

413
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:39,380
This is perfect.

414
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,423
Perfect, my butt!

415
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,469
He worked under the Sun
picking peppers, lettuces, spinach--

416
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,389
You know nothing.
Look at this.

417
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,848
How many is that?

418
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,475
Four, right?

419
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,103
How many live in this house?

420
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,604
Four.

421
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,191
This is perfect for
a resident get-together.

422
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,360
The four of us could
go see a movie together.

423
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:02,695
Right.

424
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,322
Better strike while the iron is hot.

425
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,867
Let's see. How's this Friday?

426
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,412
I think it'll work.

427
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,831
I will contact the group.

428
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,460
I wonder what stupid thing
Tae-hee seong-nim is up to right now.

429
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,963
Tell me about it.

430
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,424
That kid's got a screw loose somewhere.

431
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,188
"A Dime A Job house get-together
will be held this Friday.

432
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,150
Please join us for a group movie watching.

433
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,361
There will be a fine of 912.8 billion Won
for non-attendance,

434
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:45,779
so don't even think about it.

435
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,032
Bongsu Cinema, at 2 p.m.

436
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,285
-Being late will get you 3621 gonjang's!
-Jeez.

437
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,203
Can you go?

438
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,414
I'll have to see.

439
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:01,879
Excuse me.

440
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,090
-Hello?
-Dude! Are you crazy?

441
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,509
You went back there?
Are you finally losing it?

442
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:11,305
You have something with that
"let's break up" guy, don't you?

443
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:15,476
-I knew it. I heard from Jung-hwa that--
-Hey, So-ra, I, I'm working. Yeah. Bye!

444
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:23,984
Done with work?

445
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,873
Is it gonna rain soon?

446
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,296
My back hurts, and my knees hurt.

447
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,175
And still I go crazy over rain.

448
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,762
Maybe in my past life I was a dog.

449
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,558
I love the rain so much!

450
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:02,856
My mom used to say, "body and mind
not matching up is the saddest thing",

451
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:05,234
and she was absolutely right.

452
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,751
How nice.

453
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,469
What's up?

454
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,391
I was just thinking what to do.

455
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:40,269
About what?

456
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,772
Whenever it rains,

457
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,526
I get anxious for no reason.

458
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,113
Reminds me of my childhood too.

459
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,742
Do I have to pray to mom again?

460
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,244
I wonder every time.

461
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:03,751
It's raining.

462
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,838
-When is your mom coming?
-Like, four, I think.

463
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh man.

464
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,101
-Hey, Baek Dal-shik-i!
-Yes, sir.

465
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,920
Mom.

466
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:51,173
I have to go home and save the laundry.

467
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,217
When I

468
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,512
say that like a magic chant,

469
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,263
the rain would stop.

470
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:04,686
What chant?

471
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,064
It's a secret.

472
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,068
-I'll buy you KBBQ.
-Wow!

473
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,111
That hurts my pride.

474
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:23,163
Well, there were days it didn't work.

475
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,753
On days like that...

476
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,964
-Dong-joo!
-Little pumpkin!

477
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,758
Sora, Grandma!

478
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,677
Quickly.

479
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:43,392
Oh, my little puppy.
You must have waited long. Here.

480
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:48,105
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Yes.

481
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:55,320
She would send So-ra's grandmother
who brought an umbrella for me.

482
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,291
Grandma!

483
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:17,426
Here.

484
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,227
Grandma, you know Baek Dong-joo, right?

485
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,481
You know.

486
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,902
You used to bring her an umbrella.

487
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,070
Back in high school

488
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,115
You altered her school uniform,
fixed her gym suits,

489
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,034
sewed name tag and buttons.

490
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:45,037
You made her a handkerchief
for our graduation.

491
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,538
That's not all.

492
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:49,833
You always made her meat sides and
freshly cooked rice when she was here.

493
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,252
You made her ojingeopo side to take home,

494
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,212
and you really adored her.

495
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,174
She's got some senses, though.

496
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,052
She gets seasonal fruits for you,

497
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,720
gloves for birthday.

498
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,183
She once went all the way to City Hall
to get you this well known Castella.

499
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:09,728
Grandma.

500
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,689
Dong-joo is such a fox.

501
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:13,899
Cunning.

502
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,233
She has a man.

503
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,902
I know she does!

504
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,196
Everybody knows it
but she acts dumb.

505
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,783
What do you think?

506
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,494
It'll come.

507
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,623
-Huh?
-"This is the guy."

508
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,042
The moment one realizes this.

509
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,752
If it's fate.

510
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,297
Really?

511
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,758
Would it come for me too?

512
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,219
-Of course.
-When?

513
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,096
Within a moon.

514
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,689
Who is this young maiden?

515
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,818
How beautiful.

516
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,030
-How old are you?
-25.

517
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,658
-Are you married?
-I want to.

518
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,537
Oh no, at that age?

519
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,871
Do you have a plan?

520
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,375
You should be having many babies by now.

521
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,129
There's no worse disrespect than this
to your parents.

522
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,094
It's raining, Grandma.

523
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:28,140
Please get some rest while
watching the rain fall.

524
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:33,145
Sewing seems to have
absolutely no positive effect on dementia.

525
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,464
It's me instead of grandma today.

526
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,634
Let's go.

527
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,307
I don't think it'll stop today.

528
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,278
Let's go.

529
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,957
Wait up.

530
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,002
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

531
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,425
A friend's grandmother?

532
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,512
Is it...

533
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,724
the umbrella grandma--

534
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,105
That's why you even changed shifts.

535
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,001
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

536
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,600
-Should we go that way instead?
-Why?

537
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,196
-That's him, isn't it?
-Who?

538
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:15,200
-Is that him?
-That's...

539
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:16,785
Kim Tae-hee.

540
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,834
That's right.
It's Dr. Kim Tae-hee.

541
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:37,973
Baby.

542
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:42,310
I know it's painful and hard.

543
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,230
It is for me too.
I'm about to lose my mind.

544
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,776
But why do we have to break up
because of this? Why?

545
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,697
I'll wait as long as you need it.

546
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,825
You'll be okay after some time.

547
00:42:58,994 --> 00:42:59,995
Chung-ha.

548
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,340
I just can't stand myself.

549
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,969
Me, being alive and breathing

550
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,269
I'm disgusted by myself.

551
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,486
Struggling to form a family with you,

552
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:35,947
even this rain falling on me,

553
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,579
it's just all horrible.

554
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,212
I'm sorry.

555
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,978
TAE-HEE

556
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,580
So that you don't have
anything to worry about,

557
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:28,750
we will take great care of everything.

558
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,004
As you are also a friend of our employee,

559
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,633
we will be even more attentive.

560
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,677
Thank you. We will leave it to you.

561
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,223
How amazing.

562
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,849
Dong-joo.

563
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:51,773
I have never even imagined that
you would be sending my mother off.

564
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,152
We'll leave her to you.

565
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,447
Yes, sir.

566
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:02,700
Look after

567
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,577
So-ra for us as well.

568
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,871
I will.

569
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,206
Thank you.

570
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,626
Dong-joo.

571
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,254
Go ahead to your friends.

572
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,297
Yes, go ahead.

573
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,063
What I regret the most is

574
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:34,983
every day

575
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:37,569
"Grandma,

576
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,946
who am I?"

577
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,740
I would ask her.

578
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,452
Trying to make sure

579
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,788
that she hasn't forgotten me.

580
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,628
Grandma struggled so hard every time.

581
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,092
What was so important
for her to recognize me

582
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:08,183
that I asked over and over again,
and eventually get disappointed?

583
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:13,771
I should have just said

584
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,148
"Grandma,

585
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,610
it's okay to forget everything."

586
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,820
I should have.

587
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:25,700
She even forgot about Dad that she loved
more than her own life.

588
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,787
She erased off yesterday,

589
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,958
and always only had today.

590
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,045
What was so important about that?

591
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,968
They say they take
all of the good memories.

592
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,471
She will remember everything.

593
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,768
Did you have

594
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:53,895
anything you

595
00:46:54,854 --> 00:46:56,564
wanted to do for Grandma?

596
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,941
Yesterday,

597
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,487
Grandma asked me

598
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,283
to clip her nails,

599
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:11,704
and I wasn't able to.

600
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,087
Hey! Bring another bottle of Soju here!

601
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,005
-Right away.
-What in the world...

602
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:25,593
Hey, lady.

603
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,888
What is wrong with him?

604
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,933
Who is that ajeossi?

605
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,144
I don't know. I guess Grandma knew him.

606
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,230
So annoying.

607
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,382
You did well today as always.

608
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,721
It's tomorrow, right?

609
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,806
The Coffining.

610
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:17,770
Yes.

611
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,982
So that you don't regret anything

612
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,905
Everything you wanted to say

613
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,324
or couldn't say,

614
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,827
you should go tell her.

615
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,875
She would be happy...

616
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,172
that until the very end

617
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,216
you were with her.

618
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:27,840
My little pumpkin.

619
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:30,927
When did you grow up so much?

620
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,019
Please don't leave, Grandma.

621
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,564
How can I not?

622
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:46,693
I'm blessed with you on my way.

623
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,280
I got to see you, Dong-joo.

624
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,284
Dong-joo.

625
00:49:56,536 --> 00:50:01,541
Thank you for taking good care
of this old grandma for this long.

626
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,463
So-ra has

627
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,842
also worked hard taking care of me.

628
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:16,889
How hard it must have been for her,
taking care of a broken grandma.

629
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:21,978
I should have left earlier
so my kids didn't have to work so much.

630
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,064
Though a part of me

631
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:28,693
wanted to go after I saw her get married.

632
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:33,656
To give So-ra as a wedding gift,

633
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,034
I prepared something with my bad skills.

634
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:41,873
My brain had become a rock
and I couldn't tell her.

635
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:47,211
You can tell So-ra to make sure
she takes it when she gets married, right?

636
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,338
Of course.

637
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,556
If I had a little more time,
I would have prepared one more.

638
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,019
I'm sorry.

639
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,523
No, I'm sorry.

640
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,026
And...

641
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:17,158
thank you so much for not taking
pity on me because I had no mother.

642
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:22,330
For being compassionate and loving to me.

643
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:31,088
Yes. I'll tell her
when I meet your mother.

644
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:36,928
I promise I'll tell her that
Dong-joo grew up beautiful and great.

645
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,012
Thank you.

646
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:42,225
Of course, I'm sure mom is
always watching over you.

647
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,898
Stop the crying, child.

648
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:56,906
Grandma is happy.
Happy that I got to see you before I go.

649
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:01,786
Happy that I can talk to you
with a clear mind like this.

650
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,168
So-ra also, but Dong-joo,

651
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,129
find your match quickly.

652
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,343
Love is an amazing feeling.

653
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,430
There's nothing
better than that in this world.

654
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,891
When it's hard and tiring,

655
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,188
you bring out the memories to endure
for the rest of your life.

656
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:34,527
The time I waited for So-ra's grandpa,
dinner on the warm side of the room.

657
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,406
Going past the town entrance

658
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,827
to greet So-ra's grandpa
coming home on a bicycle.

659
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,206
When he would pull out
roasted chestnuts from his clothes

660
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,168
that he kept in there just in case
it gets cold on the 10 ri way home.

661
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,381
When we would eat them together.

662
00:52:57,425 --> 00:53:00,511
You live thanks to those tiny moments.

663
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,640
Those memories will never, ever

664
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,350
be forgotten

665
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,145
or disappear.

666
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,110
Whether it rains or pours,

667
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,488
live your life loving.

668
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,283
Yes, ma'am.

669
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,121
Soon, there will be a day
you recognize him.

670
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:33,294
That miraculous moment will come to you.

671
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:36,923
Alright.

672
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,978
Grandma...

673
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,665
COFFIN ROOM
(WATCHING ROOM)

674
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,639
Grandma looked pretty.

675
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,641
What.

676
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,228
Thanks.

677
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,024
You're so amazing.

678
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:48,828
Why are you crying more than me?

679
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:02,049
-So-ra mom, come out here.
-Yes.

680
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:08,014
Hey, girl! Get me some more of this.

681
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,475
Ajeossi, please leave.

682
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,936
-What?
-Please leave.

683
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,022
How many bottles did he have in two days?

684
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,151
You disrespectful bitch!

685
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,987
How dare you talk back to an adul--

686
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,822
Sir.

687
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:28,909
Sir, you must have had a lot to drink.

688
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:30,995
Who the hell are you?

689
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,375
The departure is early morning tomorrow.

690
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,796
The bereaved are cleaning up
and going home, so you should also go--

691
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:45,509
Sir, you shouldn't be doing this--

692
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,181
Sir!

693
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,684
-Should we go outside and have a smoke?
-Yeah?

694
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,396
Let us go then.

695
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:58,647
Let go of me!

696
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:01,734
Sir, your shoes.

697
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:03,569
Cigarette. Give me cigarette.

698
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,529
Where's my cigarette?!

699
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:09,658
Let go of me!

700
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,995
Hey. Who do you think you are?

701
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:19,001
Let go. Let go!

702
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,712
Leave.

703
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:26,634
Leave, I said.

704
00:56:29,637 --> 00:56:30,638
Dad.

705
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,640
What do you think about that ajeossi?

706
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,267
I'm fond of him.

707
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,561
Me too.

708
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,648
Did Grandma send him to me?

709
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,901
Why would she?

710
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,114
-Hm?
-Yeah.

711
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:52,660
Director.

712
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,206
Dong-joo. Thank you so much.

713
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,876
-It's nothing.
-Thank you, very much.

714
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,048
Thank you. We'll see you around.

715
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:17,518
Thank you.

716
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:27,528
By the way, Dong-joo.

717
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,031
I think Grandma

718
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,785
left me a gift.

719
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,956
I just feel that way.

720
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,002
You saw the gift?

721
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,173
Already?

722
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,217
Huh?

723
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,318
Who would use this kind of blanket?

724
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,539
This is for my granddaughter

725
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:23,626
when she gets married.

726
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,037
Grandma.

727
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,199
I guess it's raining.

728
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,995
Yeah. I guess it's raining again.

729
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,582
Is that why others are late?
Traffic from the rain?

730
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,711
They'll be here.
They said they'd be on time.

731
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:53,716
Yes, Hae-an ssi.

732
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:57,386
-Dong-joo ssi, what do I do?
-What happened?

733
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,722
You know the Sokyeong
arcade incident, right?

734
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,349
This has put
the entire department on edge.

735
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:06,020
They're telling all of us to do rounds.
Man, this sucks.

736
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,230
Oh no. What do we do?

737
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:11,859
I wanted to share a popcorn and watch
the movie at a multiplex theater.

738
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:15,112
Why did such a terrible crime have to
happen right now?

739
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,655
This really sucks.

740
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:18,866
That's too bad.

741
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,452
Good luck. Bye.

742
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,539
I don't think I can go.

743
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,460
-Hae-an ssi says he can't make it.
-Neither can my uncle.

744
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,632
Then, we should leave too, right?

745
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:40,220
-Should we just watch it? The two of us?
-Huh?

746
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:44,767
-This is almost like we got ditched.
-It's whatever.

747
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,728
How about we do rock, paper, scissors?

748
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:53,484
-Do what the winner says.
-You want to watch the movie that bad?

749
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,195
-No.
-Then why?

750
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:01,700
It would be nice to say
we chose to go home.

751
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:09,291
Did you come here because you had
nothing to do? You made the time.

752
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:13,504
It sucks to just go home like this.
It's nice to feel good at least.

753
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,175
Okay, then.

754
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,719
-I'm gonna do rock.
-Huh?

755
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,555
Dong-joo ssi, you choose
however you want.

756
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,352
Rock, paper, scissors!

757
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,687
What?

758
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,773
-We're watching the movie.
-wha--

759
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:34,274
What I want.

760
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:36,610
I had some free time.

761
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:43,659
C'mon, let's go.

762
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,460
It's been a while.

763
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,971
Wow, it's been a while,
but they're all going in.

764
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,224
How is it for you?

765
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,312
Don't throw with both hands.
Left hand only holds, with a snap.

766
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,691
Like this.

767
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,241
I won't go easy.

768
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:28,787
I better defend.

769
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,341
Just you wait.

770
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:53,479
Please.

771
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,483
I did it!

772
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,195
Did you see that?

773
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:05,115
Amazing!
A stuffie worth 58000 Won!

774
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,293
-You're giving it to me?
-Yeah.

775
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,250
-Did you go to the movies?
-I didn't go.

776
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,794
Why? Why didn't you go?

777
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:03,340
You took the whole day off
to go with the girl next door.

778
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,051
You had an earful from the Sheriff too.

779
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,011
Just because.

780
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,515
It's raining.

781
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,668
Give me a minute.
I'll go get an umbrella.

782
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,128
Wait.

783
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:44,923
What's up?

784
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:54,516
Dong-joo ssi!

785
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,564
Really?

786
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,784
There's no quiet day
with Baek Dong-joo ssi.

787
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:57,412
I was scared for no reason.
It's just nice and cold.

788
01:05:57,496 --> 01:05:58,497
Huh?

789
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:00,499
The rain.

790
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,711
Every time it rained,

791
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,631
I always just waited for it to stop,

792
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,967
or waited for someone
to bring me an umbrella.

793
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,011
I didn't have to.

794
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:16,181
You only found out? At age 25?

795
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:23,772
Ever since I started the job,
I never thought to myself I was lonely.

796
01:06:25,399 --> 01:06:26,400
Well,

797
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:31,988
I was about to for the first time,

798
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,745
but then someone told me
not to chicken out.

799
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,762
Your eyes are all puffy.

800
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,813
It's nice out here today.

801
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,023
Just today?

802
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,152
Didn't you say you like rain?

803
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,821
It's a lie.

804
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,408
-Why would you lie about that?
-I wonder about that too.

805
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,661
I said something meaningless.

806
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,960
With that being said, it's raining,

807
01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:29,171
so Haemulpajeon?

808
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,675
With makgeolli?

809
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,011
Sounds good.

810
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,431
Kim Tae-hee.

811
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,692
Have you thought about me?

812
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,194
I wanted to move too.

813
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,362
Do you guys know?

814
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:37,739
Feeling concerned about someone.

815
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:38,824
First love?

816
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,033
Yes.

817
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,786
-First love.
-Why are you lying?

818
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,246
It's true though.

819
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:46,248
-I'll get off here.
-Here?
