1
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,326
Grandma.

2
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,453
Yes?

3
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,748
This is my grandchild.
He's good-looking, right?

4
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,587
Wait...

5
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,881
This boy...

6
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,966
Yes.

7
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,677
Tae-hee's younger brother.

8
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,137
Our youngest.

9
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,860
Grandma!

10
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,114
I have a younger brother.

11
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,408
My younger brother...

12
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,664
He died...

13
00:01:24,335 --> 00:01:25,336
He died

14
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,298
because of me...

15
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,063
I'll get going first.

16
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,858
Dong-joo!

17
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,363
Oh my... She must have
remembered something urgent.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,241
-Huh?
-What kind of fate...

19
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,662
...was such a beautiful young lady born
with to be in such a rough occupation?

20
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,873
Well, I guess
no one can go against their fate.

21
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,424
A DIME A JOB

22
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,773
-Try it.
-I used a date I'd never forget.

23
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,487
It's the anniversary
of my brother's death.

24
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,989
When is it?

25
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,199
It's the ninth.

26
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,632
TAE-HEE

27
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,724
I left the ring in front of Bongsu Market.

28
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,893
I have to bring it to my brother!

29
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,687
If you were there at that time...

30
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,860
If you were by my side. Only if...

31
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,284
I understand now.

32
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,212
I'm so sorry...

33
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,551
for taking this long to realize.

34
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,597
I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,527
TAE-HEE

36
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,990
The call has been forwarded
to the voicemail...

37
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,918
Let's meet up later.

38
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:13,212
I have something to tell you.

39
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:26,141
A DIME A JOB

40
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,581
Is that you, Mom?

41
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,334
The TV show ended earlier.

42
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,253
It's Hae-an.

43
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,046
Oh, it was you, Hae-an.

44
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,174
-Is your mother visiting?
-Yeah.

45
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:03,303
Where is she?
I better give her a deep bow.

46
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,473
Who knows.
I don't recommend it either way.

47
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,642
You might end up
bleeding out of your ears.

48
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,855
-Oh, you can put that back over there.
-Okay. Thank you.

49
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:13,939
No prob.

50
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,139
Whoa, what are these?

51
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,183
Hey!

52
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,650
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

53
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,153
I saw it all already.

54
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,407
Wasn't that a lab coat
Tae-hee was wearing? Hmm?

55
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,702
A doctor, or something like that?

56
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:12,915
Yeah.

57
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,379
Oh man, for real?

58
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,843
Then why's he wasting his life away here?

59
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,806
Hey! You calling
A Dime A Job a waste of a life?

60
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,476
You little punk,
tell me how you really feel!

61
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,977
That's not what I meant.

62
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,069
By the way, I saw that

63
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,822
there was also a kid.

64
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,701
Who's that? Is he from the hospital?

65
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,996
Just pretend you didn't notice.

66
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,456
Well,

67
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,960
he can't be something,
like, a secret child, right?

68
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,132
Oh man, why are you staying silent?
Was I right?

69
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,217
You.

70
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,011
Don't say anything in front of Tae-hee.

71
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,638
What would I say?

72
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,392
You haven't told me
anything not to say yet!

73
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,774
Little brother.

74
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,027
Huh?

75
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,156
That's Tae-hee's little brother.

76
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,246
L... Little brother...

77
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,085
He... had a brother that young?

78
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,629
Yeah.

79
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,424
But...

80
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,135
he left this world.

81
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,600
-Hey.
-Yes.

82
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,145
So you better not act like
you know anything about this, all right?

83
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,980
Don't tell Tae-hee anything!

84
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,274
Okay.

85
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,777
Why did you have to bring
these pictures out?!

86
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,495
Do you know
how worried I was about you all day?

87
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,210
I wondered, "Did something happen,
is she getting sick," you know?

88
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,139
-Uh, if my grandma--
-Tae-hee.

89
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,489
I saw the picture
on your grandmother's phone.

90
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,622
Your little brother.

91
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,503
I...

92
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,803
met your little brother.

93
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,897
I'm so sorry. I...

94
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,442
I was so scared, I ran away from him.

95
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:31,738
I'm...

96
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,116
I'm so sorry.

97
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,993
While working this job

98
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,998
I met a child exactly once.

99
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,585
-You've even met a child?
-Yeah.

100
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,007
He was considerate.

101
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,635
A child who worried about others

102
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,971
more than himself.

103
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,265
The child I met that one time

104
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,185
was Joon-ho.

105
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,956
I'm so sorry.

106
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,626
I left Joon-ho alone and ran away.

107
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,921
I'm... I'm so sorry.

108
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:38,889
Joon-ho...

109
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,101
How was he?

110
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,856
He would have been so scared.

111
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,401
He would have been in so much pain.

112
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,075
What did Joon-ho say?

113
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,747
I should have delivered this back then.

114
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,503
Joon-ho

115
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,464
asked me to deliver this to you.

116
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,086
Please help me...

117
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:30,936
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,940
I was too late with the delivery.

119
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,530
And...

120
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,494
also for leaving
Joon-ho alone in the room.

121
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,331
I'm sorry.

122
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,461
No.

123
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,965
Don't say such a thing.

124
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,761
You don't have to be sorry.

125
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,892
A DIME A JOB

126
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,769
Why don't you stay a few more nights?

127
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,189
I would rather leave
than continue looking at you.

128
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,983
You don't want to see Noona?

129
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,946
Your sister is in such mourning,

130
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,365
I don't want to see her like that.

131
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,828
All right. Let me
give you a ride home then.

132
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,333
No, thanks! Not in a car like that.
I'd rather take a taxi.

133
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,418
We insist.

134
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,045
You do?

135
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,507
I can't refuse
my little puppy's insistence.

136
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:30,347
I will, then. Make sure you eat well,
and take care of yourself.

137
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,016
You need to gain some weight.

138
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,519
Obey your moth--

139
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,776
You don't have to obey your uncle.
Don't obey your uncle!

140
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,694
He doesn't to begin with!

141
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,531
Mom, there is no order and discipline
in the household because of you!

142
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,241
You little... Come over here.

143
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,203
You cut your ridiculous hair right now.
Cut your hair!

144
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,246
Mom, the ancestors said,
"Body parts come from parents,"

145
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,040
and "You may cut off my head
but not my hair!"

146
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,250
"Body parts" my ass. Come over here!

147
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,754
-I'll kill you and kill myself too!
-Ow, ow!

148
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,606
Make this for your sister
when she gets here.

149
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,692
Don't eat it all by yourself!

150
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,360
Pssh.

151
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,571
And then she runs away
before her daughter gets here.

152
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,424
This kid, picking pictures
without me in it.

153
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,594
Everyone always leaves me out.

154
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:19,080
EPISODE 12
TO CONFRONT YOU

155
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,295
-Oh.
-Hello.

156
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,131
-Are you getting off work now?
-Yes.

157
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,346
-Mom!
-I told you not to come here.

158
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,558
-Didn't I tell you to stay home?
-But I'm hungry.

159
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,977
-There's nothing to eat at home.
-Shush.

160
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,773
Go home and eat this.

161
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,525
-When will you be home?
-I'll be late today.

162
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,363
Go home now. Be safe. Get home quickly!

163
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,417
Baek Dong-joo.

164
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,382
By the way, why did Grandma leave early?

165
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,597
Day after tomorrow
is the death anniversary.

166
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,812
Grandma really adored my brother.

167
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,318
She must not be ready yet.

168
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,446
Same with seeing my mother.

169
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,949
Oh, then your parents are...

170
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,202
They are coming tomorrow.

171
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,208
Where are they coming from?

172
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,712
-Goheung.
-I see. They moved really far.

173
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,508
I've been to their previous home.

174
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,302
To deliver the ring
as quickly as possible.

175
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,725
If it was a police officer rather than me
that found the ring,

176
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,228
would you have gotten it on time?

177
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,814
Huh?

178
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:11,067
Oh, because Joon-ho told me

179
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:15,071
to ask a police officer
if I can't find the ring.

180
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,115
A police officer?

181
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,410
Mm-hmm.

182
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,262

Q: ACCUSED'S REPRESENTATIVE'S NAME?
A: SEO HAE-AN

187
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:03,870
Hey there.

188
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,042
You come here every time you drink.
Send in a complaint to take him.

189
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,628
-I'm in the Civil Complaints Division.
-Good for you!

190
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,754
How've you been?

191
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,216
Seo Hae-an, you were top
of the class at the police academy?

192
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,011
Huh? That makes no sense.

193
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,389
-Yes. Traffic Incident Investigations.
-Yes.

194
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,516
Must be why you looked familiar.

195
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,437
-I go there every year to give a lecture.
-I see. I understand.

196
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,147
-This is pretty good.
-I see.

197
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:32,982
Let's go.

198
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,484
-Huh?
-Eonju Uni Hospital.

199
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,986
-Yessir.
-Not you. Come on!

200
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,489
See ya.

201
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,010
Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,554
It's nothing.

203
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,932
One sec. Excuse me!

204
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,603
You dropped this.

205
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:13,648
Oh.

206
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,317
Thank you.

207
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,072
Why else would I call?

208
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,866
I'm reporting that I got
into the ICU. Where you at?

209
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,787
Oh. I'm on my way home.
Hey, the bus is here. I'm hanging up.

210
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,458
The bus? No way, what bus at this hour?
I bet you're with your boyfriend.

211
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,670
Are you on a date?
What are you doing out this late!

212
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,424
Express buses these days
extended its hours to run this late.

213
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,552
-I'm hanging up.
-Stop saying that. Put him on the phone!

214
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,304
I'm hanging up for real.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later!

215
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
It's fine.

216
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,688
-Oh, the bus is here. Let's go.
-Oh, okay.

217
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,199
Oh, the friend from the call...

218
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,327
She was visiting home that one time.
Remember?

219
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,374
-Oh.
-Her name is So-ra. She's a nurse.

220
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,210
She transferred to my hospital.
She says she got into the ICU.

221
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,757
She tells me everything like that
all the time.

222
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,454
Sleep well.

223
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,623
Good night.

224
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,801
Tae-hee.

225
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,181
Is something the matter?

226
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,711
Sleep well.

227
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:45,383
Good night.

228
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:04,485
Okay, okay.

229
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,268
Because Joon-ho told me

230
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,897
to ask a police officer
if I can't find the ring.

231

EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HOME

232
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,625
-Oh, Dong-joo.
-Yes?

233
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,294
-Have a good lunch.
-You too!

234
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,724
I told you not to come here.
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

235
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,353
But I'm hungry.
There's nothing to eat at home.

236
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:21,646
Oh...

237
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,036
-You're here to see your mom.
-Who are you?

238
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,664
Oh, I'm...

239
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,584
I work with your mom.

240
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,384
FUNERAL DIRECTOR BAEK DONG-JOO

241
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,762
Oh.

242
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,682
Then please buy me some tteokbokki.

243
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,767
Tteokbokki?

244
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,312
STELLA TTEOKBOKKI

245
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,983
-Why aren't you eating?
-Hmm? I am eating.

246
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,235
Here.

247
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,198
Try dipping this in here.

248
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:25,209
-Wow, this is good. The cheese is so rich.
-Right?

249
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:34,093
Why tteokbokki though?
Don't you have it often with your friends?

250
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,388
I don't even get an allowance.

251
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:42,518
It's okay. I don't have time to, anyways.
I have to practice dancing.

252
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,479
-Dance?
-I'm gonna become a K-pop star.

253
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,444
Welcome to A Dime A Job!

254
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,905
-You made it! Must have been a long trip.
-Nah, it was fine.

255
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,789
How've you been, my dear son?

256
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,670
Give me a hug, it's been a while.

257
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,682
What a tear-jerking mother-son reunion.

258
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,061
Hyang-bok, is this your office?

259
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,563
Yes. Office is here,
and residence is in the back.

260
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,361
Hey, what's wrong
with your hair this time?

261
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,614
What do you have against my hair?
You jealous?

262
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,450
-Let's head in.
-Sure.

263
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,078
-That little...
-Let's go, Mom.

264
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,162
Okay.

265
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,338
Wow, so this is what this tastes like.

266
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:57,718
What should we do?
I better head inside soon.

267
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,682
Thank you for the meal.
Can you keep this a secret from my mom?

268
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,520
You got it. Don't worry about it.

269
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,275
-Oh, Eonni.
-Yes?

270
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,277
What's your phone model?

271
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,488
-My phone?
-Yeah.

272
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:22,243
Hello. I'm Yoon Seol-a from Bongcheong
Elementary, third year, third class.

273
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:23,452
One second.

274
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,874
Hmm. Should we tuck
your hair behind your ears?

275
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,754
Nah, it was better before.
Let's try it again.

276
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,798
Please introduce yourself.

277
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,052
Hello. I'm Yoon Seol-a from Bongcheong
Elementary, third year, third class.

278
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,304
Yoon Seol-a,
why do you want to be a singer?

279
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,723
Um...

280
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:49,186
EONJU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

281
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:05,077
How dare you meet up with this filthy
undertaker when your baby is sick!

282
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,624
I'll take care of the baby.

283
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,586
Thank you, I'll only take a moment.

284
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,980
By the way, how do you dance so well?
Where'd you learn?

285
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,440
K-pop star fancams.

286
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:38,777
My classmates only get to watch if
they get a good grade on the English test,

287
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,905
but my mom only knows about money.

288
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,575
Money, money, money.
And still complains about not having any.

289
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,953
Is this your phone number?

290
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,332
Yeah. Call me if you need
to take videos of anything else.

291
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,917
I'll think about it.

292
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,587
We're here. I live right there.

293
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,799
Go ahead inside.

294
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,764
-Hey, Eonni.
-Yeah.

295
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:10,601
-I'm good at singing too.
-Whoa, really?

296
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,312
I have to take a video
of the singing as well.

297
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:16,398
Can you help me with that too?

298
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:23,822
Oh... But what can I do?
I have to head back to work now.

299
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:28,202
Um... Would it be okay
to meet up again next week to do that?

300
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,081
I'd like that! I'll practice until then.

301
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,041
Thank you, Eonni.

302
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,210
Take care.

303
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,809
...because Joon-ho told me

304
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,604
to ask a police officer
if I can't find the ring.

305
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,153
What's up?

306
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,795
Do you know of anyone that was
at Joon-ho's accident at the time?

307
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,549
-Who?
-Maybe like a police officer.

308
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,263
Hmm... There must have been.

309
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,349
A first responder.

310
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,352
Right, first responder...

311
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
Why do you ask?

312
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,611
Just curious about the incident.

313
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,489
-Anything else from the investigation?
-Well...

314
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,285
You must know it was dark
and there were no passersby,

315
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,747
so they weren't transported
to the hospital right away.

316
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:59,418
You must also know
that a man living nearby reported it.

317
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:04,632
Also the driver was caught at the scene,
so there's nothing else to investigate.

318
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,386
Is something wrong?

319
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,972
Oh, no.

320
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,603
My goodness, how much longer
do I have to look after this idiot...

321
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,740
MAKE THIS FOR YOUR SISTER
WHEN SHE GETS HERE.

322
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,438
Mom...

323
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:00,539
Wow.

324
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,332
Starting with handmade mandu.

325
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,334
Mother prepared everything.

326
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,420
Everything you like. Right?

327
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,132
You saw I didn't touch a single dumpling.

328
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,050
So please tell our mom that, Sis.

329
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,179
-Now then, shall we dig in?
-Yes.

330
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,556
Thank you for the meal.

331
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,988
You should have this.

332
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:43,081
What is this, conveyor belt sushi?!
Just serve yourselves!

333
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:47,377
Uncle.

334
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,088
Thank you, my nephew.

335
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,473
-Mmm. The ribs are amazing.
-Are they?

336
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:13,695
I...

337
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,365
I-- I think I got top grade in the class.

338
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:20,202
-First place in the police academy!
-Oh man! You did?

339
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,998
Those at the top are promised assignment
to the department of their choice.

340
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,919
Oh man, we're done struggling, Brother.
Good job!

341
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:33,048
I thought, for once in my life,

342
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:39,429
something called "happiness" was coming.

343
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,891
I, uh, can't let today go by.

344
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,354
-Hey, let's drink.
-I wish you would stop drinking.

345
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,481
And just get married.

346
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,276
What do I own
that I would find love and get married?

347
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:55,445
I'm a mess with a rap sheet
instead of a high school diploma.

348
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,699
I have an alcoholic father
who kicked the bucket in prison,

349
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,660
and a mom that was
on the news when she passed.

350
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,335
I'm done for,

351
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,713
so just worry about yourself.

352
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,050
Man, how are you our father's son?

353
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,721
Was there a mistake somewhere?

354
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,601
I think I'm also done for.

355
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,716
Are your parents here?

356
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,640
I bet they were very happy
to see you for the first time in a while.

357
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,104
It must have been two years.

358
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,867
A parent who has lost their child

359
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,289
is alive, but not alive at all.

360
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:36,630
Their insides are empty,
about to crumble away.

361
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,424
Even if they are alive, they are dead.

362
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,178
I...

363
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,395
I must have done that to my parents too.

364
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,818
But even then,
just because I'm their child,

365
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,702
they are so sorry that I am hurt,

366
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,332
even though they're dead themselves.

367
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,845
Compared to that,

368
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,600
I'm really going through nothing.

369
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,020
I felt so terrible about that,

370
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,484
I couldn't endure it.

371
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,618
You said sorry that you ran away, right?

372
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:00,297
I couldn't even
keep him company on his way.

373
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,218
Neither could I keep my parents company.

374
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:06,803
DECEASED KIM JOON-HO NIM

375
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,934
It's me that ran away.

376
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,776
Do you know

377
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,654
what one hears the most at a funeral?

378
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,325
"If you're alive, you should live."

379
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,749
I thought that was
such a cruel thing to say.

380
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:39,586
But

381
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,176
the deceased tell me the same thing.

382
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,931
To keep those left behind alive.

383
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,226
To make it less painful for them.

384
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,192
So...

385
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,281
please live.

386
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,077
You should live too, Tae-hee.

387
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:16,540
Stay alive

388
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,002
and remember him.

389
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,426
People say that if someone is remembered,

390
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:34,391
they are not completely gone,
even if they pass.

391
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,859
Please give this to Joon-ho.

392
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,571
Make sure to tell him tomorrow

393
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,741
that there are many people
who remember him.

394
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,171
How come you're out in the cold?

395
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,465
I'm so full, I had to digest a bit.

396
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,845
It's great eating Mom's food
for the first time in so long.

397
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,517
I asked you to visit us so many times.
Why did you not come once?

398
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,060
I'm sorry.

399
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,451
Mom.

400
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,119
Hmm?

401
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,964
What's the occasion?
Holding your mom's hand like that.

402
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,301
Was my food that good?

403
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,268
Let's go together tomorrow.

404
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,693
Yeah, let's.

405
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,205
Joon-ho would be so excited tomorrow.

406
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:23,833
To see Mom, Dad, and Brother all together.

407
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,353
DECEASED KIM JOON-HO

408
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:50,568
Joon-ho, your mom's here.

409
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,889
-GOOD NIGHT!
-YES, HAVE SWEET DREAMS.

410
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,824
It went well. I'm back now.
Thought you might be worried.

411
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:41,554
It'll be a long trip
driving all the way down there again.

412
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,392
Let's get going before rush hour.

413
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,018
-Yes, we should.
-Oh, the bag.

414
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,732
Take care of yourself.

415
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:56,820
Goodness.

416
00:44:58,405 --> 00:44:59,989
Don't worry about me. Okay?

417
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,204
Come on,
families aren't supposed to be like this.

418
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:09,040
-Stop it, stop. Stop, I say.
-Let's go.

419
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,627
-Drive safe.
-Go ahead. Get going, go, go.

420
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,215
Oh, Hae-an! Come over here.

421
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,968
Come over, come over!

422
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,264
He lives on our second floor.

423
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,518
Say hi. This is my older sister
and brother-in-law.

424
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,895
Therefore, Kim Tae-hee's parents.

425
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,691
-Hello.
-Yes, nice to meet you.

426
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,237
-Oh, right! His hometown is Yeosu too.
-I see.

427
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,115
That's an hour away from where we live.
Where in Yeosu?

428
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,828
-G-- Gwangmu District.
-Oh.

429
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,997
-Heading to work?
-Yes.

430
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:54,335
I really gotta get to work now. I'll
make sure to properly meet you next time.

431
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:56,045
-I'll be going now.
-Work hard!

432
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,422
-Will do!
-All right.

433
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,383
Go home now, shoo.

434
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,969
Go ahead now. Go, go.

435
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:37,962
Tae-hee!

436
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,634
-Hey.
-What brings you all the way here?

437
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:47,680
I wanted to give you this.

438
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,898
You should, uh, dress warmer.

439
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,942
You'll catch a cold like that.

440
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,449
What's with the silence?

441
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,535
Are you blown away?

442
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,792
I've never in my life
received anything like this.

443
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,796
Thank you, Tae-hee.

444
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:28,972
Hae-an.

445
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:30,890
Yeah?

446
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,565
I like Dong-joo.

447
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:44,279
We're dating.

448
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:56,457
Oh... It must have been you
that Dong-joo ssi likes.

449
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,926
Letting days go by without telling you

450
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,518
felt like a mistake to me.
That's why I'm telling you.

451
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:18,938
I bet you feel betrayed.

452
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,567
You may hate me.

453
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,530
Seo Hae-an. Come here for a sec.

454
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,366
Oh, go ahead.

455
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,002
Tae-hee.

456
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,632
You don't have to be so sorry about it.

457
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:48,968
I...

458
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,513
I really like you.

459
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,933
I'm always on your side.

460
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,398
Thank you so much for this.
I'll wear it with care.

461
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,484
No problem. Go on inside.

462
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,236
Okay.

463
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,447
I'll be going then.

464
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,213
Oh?

465
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:30,510
You're the Eonju Uni Hospital
Emergency Room doctor, right?

466
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,595
I'm Seol Hyun-yong, from investigations.

467
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,056
Oh... Hello.

468
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,976
You know, back when I used to get
dispatched to ER every other day,

469
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,146
all the other doctors
gave me the cold shoulder,

470
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,232
but you alone were friendly to me.

471
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:45,858
I remember you.

472
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,986
I heard the news.

473
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,823
That you left the hospital
after the incident.

474
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,327
I was assigned your brother's case.

475
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:58,705
What?

476
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,833
There was no time to say hi.

477
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,960
Your father came for statements.

478
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,463
I actually did see you at the ER that day.

479
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:09,966
You were probably not yourself.

480
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:13,010
-Did you by chance go to the site too?
-The site?

481
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,305
The first responder was
dispatched from the police box. Why?

482
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,517
I'm wondering
if there were any words from them.

483
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,688
When he got there, they were on their way
to the ER already despite the late report.

484
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,317
The bastard's
still in the hospital, right?

485
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,325
-Yes.
-Man, he better not die like that.

486
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:39,120
Drunk drivers need
to be severely punished.

487
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:40,788
If he dies...

488
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,252
will the case close?

489
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:47,336
Yeah.

490
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:50,590
If he dies, it all ends.

491
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:08,858
When he got there, they were on their way
to the ER already despite the late report.

492
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,325
Yes, Eonju University Hospital
Funeral Home.

493
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,132
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

494
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:19,679
Is it... possible to do
the coffining at night?

495
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:25,893
I mean, it's just I think it'd be better
to get it over with sooner than later.

496
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,814
I see. Well, I will take a look
at our schedule and let you know.

497
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,068
And, uh,

498
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:40,867
if you could... hide the marks.

499
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,246
Of course. We will keep our eye on them.

500
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,423
Dong-joo, I will take this one
with Team Leader Seo.

501
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,051
-Okay.
-All right.

502
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:03,973
Team Leader Im.

503
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,187
Please let me do it.

504
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:23,618
Eonni, I'm not dreaming, am I?

505
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,246
This is the waiting room?

506
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,582
Am I going to dance now?

507
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,589
Are you going to do my makeup?

508
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:46,766
Wow... These clothes are so pretty too.

509
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,938
See? I told you I should only eat
a little bit of the tteokbokki.

510
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,606
I probably gained weight.

511
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,484
Not at all. You're fine.

512
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,865
Is this really not a dream?

513
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,992
What if it is?

514
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:09,038
I fell asleep watching
the video you took of me.

515
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,667
I'm afraid that this will be a dream.

516
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:20,591
Because this place is so amazing.

517
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:23,594
I don't want to go home.

518
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,225
ROOM 5
DECEASED YOON SEOL-A / PARK HYE-JIN NIM

519
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,227
CHIEF MOURNER
UNCLE: PARK YOO-YEOL

520
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,610
A mother-daughter double suicide, right?

521
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,032
Murder-suicide.

522
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,998
I believe she should be punished
even after death.

523
00:54:56,919 --> 00:55:00,506
A female "A" in her forties has murdered
her pre-teen daughter

524
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:01,924
and committed suicide.

525
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:05,886
Her suicide note found on site
was revealed to have contained

526
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,182
her financial struggles and that
she couldn't leave her daughter behind.

527
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:13,477
Such is the most extreme case
of child abuse, and...

528
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,648
I'm... dead, you say?

529
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,736
-Seol-a...
-You're lying, right?

530
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:25,322
There's no way my mom would do that to me.
Why would she?

531
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,037
I don't want to die.

532
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:34,874
I want to live. Please let me live.

533
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,918
You promised
to take a video of me singing.

534
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,047
I'm sorry, Seol-a.

535
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,594
I don't want to die.

536
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,805
I want to try dyeing my hair,

537
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,308
fly on an airplane,

538
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,102
have a boyfriend...

539
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,439
Uh, drink boba tea one more time.

540
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:02,777
I have so many things I want to do.

541
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:07,740
I don't care if I'm poor.
I don't care if I'm hungry.

542
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,580
Please save me.

543
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:19,460
Please, save me and my mom...

544
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:12,763
Huh?

545
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,248
I just can't believe it.

546
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,127
How could she do that? Her own daughter...

547
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,132
I was gonna make her pay
when she woke up. I was...

548
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,302
-...gonna slap her or something, but--
-Is that enough for you?

549
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,595
But she didn't wake up.

550
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:58,767
It wasn't like the last time where someone
suddenly came in or I left the room,

551
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,937
but she didn't wake up. Why, I wonder?

552
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,480
Hmm...

553
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:08,027
Maybe she didn't deserve the gift.

554
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,404
You once said one of the deceased told you

555
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:13,157
that having met you, Stella, is a miracle.

556
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,078
But that mother committed
two serious crimes.

557
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:22,374
She took her daughter's life,
and ended her own.

558
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:27,046
Just because she is her mother,
under any circumstance,

559
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,343
taking one's life is a huge sin,
and to live one's life is not a choice.

560
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:36,555
She does not deserve
the blessing of meeting Stella.

561
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:39,725
Is it a blessing?

562
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:47,566
For Seol-a...
Was it a blessing to have met me?

563
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:51,737
There was nothing I could do for her.

564
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,827
On that day, she asked me
to take a video of her singing.

565
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:00,913
I should have...

566
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:10,005
It's not like I can revive a dead person.
What's the point?

567
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,508
-Who is it a blessing to?
-Stella.

568
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,302
I couldn't do anything for Joon-ho.

569
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,555
"Don't be afraid."

570
00:59:19,974 --> 00:59:24,937
"Tell me anything, everything you want
to say, then I'll... deliver it all."

571
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,234
That's all I can ever say or do.

572
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,780
I couldn't even do that for him.

573
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,825
You found and delivered
the ring in the end.

574
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:38,909
If I...

575
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:44,039
listened to even one more word from
Joon-ho instead of running away that day,

576
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,250
I would have had

577
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,422
something to tell Tae-hee...

578
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:59,305
The person I love is in so much pain,

579
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,726
and there's nothing

580
01:00:05,144 --> 01:00:06,312
I can do for him.

581
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,401
How could someone like me...

582
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,237
be a blessing

583
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,784
and a miracle to someone else, Father?

584
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,834
DANCE VIDEO - BONGCHEONG ELEM.
3RD YEAR - 3RD CLASS - YOON SEOL-A

585
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,295
WHO LOVES TO DANCE AND SING,
AND LIKES TTEOKBOKKI AND BOBA TEA

586
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:18,801
UPLOAD VIDEO

587
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:23,389
Bongsu District parricide case's victim
Yoon-yang's video was uploaded

588
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,182
and is currently going viral.

589
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:30,687
This video was revealed to have been taken
a day before Yoon-yang was killed.

590
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,314
Please introduce yourself.

591
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:37,027
Hello. I'm Yoon Seol-a from Bongcheong
Elementary, third year, third class.

592
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,822
Yoon Seol-a,
why do you want to be a singer?

593
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:43,367
Um... I want to be "forever."

594
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:46,995
"Forever?"

595
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:49,206
Yes. People say dances last forever.

596
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,544
Um, love, songs, novels, poems?
Things like that are said to last forever,

597
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,879
and dance is one of them
that I'm confident in.

598
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,924
Why do you want to be "forever,"
Yoon Seol-a?

599
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:02,469
-Wow, she sounds just like my daughter.
-"Forever" means alive.

600
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,223
And being "forever" will make me rich.

601
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,977
Experts say that killing one's child
due to struggles in life comes from

602
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,855
the wrong kind of parental love
that think they are

603
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:15,357
lifting the pain
that will be put on their child,

604
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:20,487
implying that they consider their child
as property and not a personal entity...

605
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,990
I have to give Mom a lot of money.

606
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,827
I want to get really rich
and live with Mom until we're 100.

607
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:49,016
I'll remember you... forever.

608
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,934
IT'S SO SAD, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?

609
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,170
Hello.

610
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,096
I'll be there.

611
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:10,889
Yes.

612
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:24,194
RESTRICTED AREA
ICU

613
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,758
Are you the guardian?

614
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:50,637
The legal guardian
of patient Seo Young-chul?

615
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,474
Oh...

616
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,353
Your visit will be in about ten minutes.

617
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,231
-Okay.
-All right.

618
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,344
-What... brings you here?
-Do you know who Kim Joon-ho is?

619
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,013
Your brother killed him.
My little brother.

620
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,766
He shot lasers from his eyes
at the guardian.

621
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,102
They seemed to know each other.

622
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,895
You went to visit that person?

623
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,608
You saw with your own eyes. His family
didn't even see each other for two years!

624
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:29,277
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

625
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:31,446
No matter how many times I think about it

626
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,407
I can never forgive him.
