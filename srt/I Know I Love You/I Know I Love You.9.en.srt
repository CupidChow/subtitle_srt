00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,120
<b>What’s wrong</b>

186
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
<b>Shi Ran knows about it</b>

187
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,399
<b>Zhao Jin’s situation</b >

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,320
<b>I think this guy is</b>

189
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
<b>Sometimes he has a strange personality</b>

190
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,960
<b>Maybe it’s because of the divorce</b>

191
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:48,960
<b>I was talking to him just now</b>

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
<b>When we were drinking together</b>

193
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,439
<b>He insisted on pulling me and refused to let me come over</b>

194
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
<b>He even said he would let you over</b>

195

<b>What do you mean about him</b> b>

196
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
<b>Why do you behave like this after drinking?</b>

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,120
<b>Maybe you drank too much</b>

198
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,399
<b>Probably so</b>

199
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,879
<b>Otherwise it would be too strange</b>

200
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,159

203
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,919

205
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,440
<b>I think this matter</b>

206

210
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,799
<b>What’s wrong with Zhao Jin</b>

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
<b>Isn’t he divorced</b>

212
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,799
<b>At most A</b>

213
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,959

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
<b>What I meant was</b>

219

<b>He is someone I know</b>

220
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,679
<b>Since we know each other</b >

221
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,080
<b>Then I shouldn’t misunderstand him</b>

222
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,159
<b>I almost misunderstood the promise</b>

223
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,480
<b>That’s what I meant</b>
