1
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:51,719
I'm sorry

2
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,000
You're right

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,719
Obviously it was me who came to find you

4
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,039
I broke it first

5
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,200
We were friends The agreement

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,879
is also shirking responsibility

7
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,359
letting you be the bad guy

8
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,519
If a friend asks

9
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
 just say you didn’t do anything 

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,239
I don’t have any other ideas

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,159
It’s all my problem

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
If you say so

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,280
Me too

14
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,959
Say I want to be friends with you

15
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,239
Make unnecessary phone calls

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,959
And just like that

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,239
Find someone

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,319
 A mess of excuses

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,959
Just to see you

20
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,799
I am even more exaggerated

21
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,799
I am also sorry

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
There is nothing I can do for you Made

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,120
It's good to know you

24
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,359
You're a good person

25
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm not

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,519
I have one now

27
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,359
A very bad idea

28
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,719
I don’t ask for anything else

29
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,079
I just hope to see you

30
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,439
It will never be discovered

31
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,879
You don’t have to do this

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,039
Actually, I understand what you mean

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,280
I am going to marry him

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,919
I mentioned it

35
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,039
Should I stop?

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
If this continues

37
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,599
You will lose a lot

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,039
It will also be very painful

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,319
Me I don’t say this to

40
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:12,960
pretend to be nice

41
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,039
I really think so

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
If I continue like this

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,159
I will only become more ridiculous< /b>

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
I just like someone

45
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,639
Who is more ridiculous than whom?

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
After working overtime

47
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,279
Go home and chat with friends

48
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,800
I feel quite happy when I think about it

49
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,519
I think it would be better to

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,879
 be with my boyfriend

51
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,199
at this time  

52
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,959
 Then just treat me

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,800
as your boyfriend

54
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,040
Wait a moment

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,079
You are quite handsome

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
Follow Looks like a girl

57
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,839
But here she does

58
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,879
Looks like a young man

59
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,439
What do you want? You

60
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,279
Give it to you

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,279
Shi Ran

62
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,199
Stop

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,199
Is it delicious

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,279
You always like to eat this kind of sweet food

65
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,879
Yes b>

66
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,079
Cheers

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think it’s still a little cold

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,040
Go and close the window

69
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
You are such a troubled person

70
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,160
 You were the one who said it was hot just now

71
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,199
Huh?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Hello

73
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,279
Where are you

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
Shi Ran’s house

75
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,319
When are you going home

76
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Later

77
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,480
If it’s too late

78
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,480
I’ll sleep here

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,639
Tomorrow is the weekend Do you have a job?

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,199
I will be at the studio tomorrow

81
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,800
giving lessons to the flower shop

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,879
My friends

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,839
I have a meeting here I want to open it

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,720
I didn’t expect to start a fund by myself

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,959
It’s more tiring than going to work

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,519
Then go back early

87
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,800
I’ll call you when I get up tomorrow 

88
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,199
Hang up

89
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,199
What's wrong

90
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,240
You said it's a normal relationship between lovers

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
Before hanging up the phone

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,279
 I must say something

93
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,399
I miss you

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,639
I love you or something like that

95
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,839
I stopped saying it a long time ago

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,959
 So when it comes to this love

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
you can’t talk about it for too long

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Do you think

99
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,199
is it because of love

100
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,040
It doesn’t last too long  b>

101
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,279
The relationship is all gone

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Then I have to ask you

103
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,079
You have been in love for such a long time

104
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,759
Not married

105
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,439
Yu An recently

106
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,519
started his own business

107
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,680
so he put it on hold

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,879
Let me ask you

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,120
What do you think of Peng Yuan< /b>

110
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,160
Do you really want to get married?

111
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,480
Actually,

112
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,319
Forget it, forget about him

113
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Cheers

114
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,800
Cheers b>

115
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,319
Shi Ran

116
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,560
There is blood

117
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,279
There is blood

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,319
What kind of blood

119
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,639
Get up and take a look

120
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,600
What kind of blood

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,319
There is blood

122
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,120
Look

123
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,439
Let me take a look

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,639
Is it blood in the stool< /b>

125
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,319
Is it serious

126
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,879
I don’t know

127
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,360
Should I

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,319
Send it to a pet hospital

00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,079
You don't have one at nine o'clock

141

What kind of training?

142
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,040
You are like this

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,720
Doctor Zhao

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
Take him for a blood test

200
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,059
Fecal examination

201
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,279
See if there are coccidia and ticks

202
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
< b>Okay

203
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,600
Maybe it’s gastroenteritis

204
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Okay

205
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,840
Come here

206
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,919
Treat the wound

207
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,120
You Bear with it for a while

208
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:31,980
Okay

209
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,039
I drink in broad daylight

210
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,559
How long does it take to brew this

211
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,120
Half an hour

212
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,679
Half an hour

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,799
I won’t get rabies

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,399
It’s possible

215
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,159
Then what did you just do

216
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,440
Don’t give it to me directly Get vaccinated

217
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,440
What are you doing with water for a long time?

218
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,879
Isn’t this all cured for you?

219
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,519
This is good. Be contented

220
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,360
Pet hospitals don’t treat people

221
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,120
Just say you have no good intentions

222
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,559
Aren’t you a pet doctor

223
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,720
Why don’t you hold the cat yourself b>

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,720
Let me hold you

225
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,240
Isn’t this your cat?

226
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,379
Hello

227
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,600
Are you okay?

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,919
 It should be fine now What about the checkup

229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,120
That’s good

230
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,759
Then I’ll hang up first. The bride has arrived

231
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,639
You go get the rabies vaccine first

232
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
Wait for the test results to come out

233
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,360
I will notify you after  

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,360
Add a WeChat account

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,159
Can I go

236
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,559
Okay

237
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,120
 Go to the door before leaving

238
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
Pay the fee

239
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:26,879
Wait a moment

240
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,600
Take this back

241
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
Apply it morning and night

242
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,600
You'll be fine soon

243
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,240
You're welcome

244
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,279
The doctor said it's nothing serious

245
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,240
Contact me when the results come out

246
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,320
Then I will Don't worry

247
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,440
I have another show tomorrow

248
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,320
It's in the suburbs

249
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,799
Do you feel sorry for our family

250
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,480
? Please feel sorry for me< /b>

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
What's wrong with you

252
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,679
I'm fine

253
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,159
Just wait until they send me the results

254
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,799
It looks like a snow-capped mountain rose

255
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,679
Also Platycodon

256
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,480
These are common

257
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,320
hand-held flowers

258
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,360
but I specially added them here

259
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,759
Snow Willow There are eucalyptus

260
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,240
In fact, the bride’s bouquet

261
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
does not have to be beautiful

262
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,519
but it must be suitable

263
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,879
We can Match according to the bride

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,279
the wedding dress she wears that day

265
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,840
and the bride's overall figure

266
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 fitting

267
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,840
is more important than looking good b>

268
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,559
Like

269
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,519
You can do it yourself first

270
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,879
Also

271
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,279
the water drop shape

272
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,000
also makes your heart beat faster 

273
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,360
Look at me

274
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,639
Wait a moment

275
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,039
Can I order flowers from you

276
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,919
Of course you can

277
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,639
Who do you want to give it to

278
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,120
My sister

279
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,720
Sister

280
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,399
Let me see

281
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,559
Thank you

282
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,879
You guys Yesterday,

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
how much did you drink 

284
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,639
Does it still taste good

285
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,080
I didn’t want to drink too much yesterday

286
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,600
but as soon as I drank it, Can't stop

287
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,360
The more I drink, the more I drink

288
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,799
It would be great if people were like this

289
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,720
I didn't have any expectations at first

290
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,240
But the more we get along, the more I feel Not bad

291
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Then I'll get busy first

292
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:03,120
Hello

293
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,640

What's the shipping address

295
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,160
What is it

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,000
I originally wanted to send it to someone else

297
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,200
But it ended up being sent to you

298
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:16,278
Sorry

299
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,440

I ask who you sent it to

302
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,640
To whom the customer ordered flowers

303
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
That’s okay

304
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,000
Dr. Zhao

305
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,039
You seem to like this cat very much

306
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,240
Don’t you think it is very cute

307
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,640

308
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:49,880
I should have known I wouldn't let you

309
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,519

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,799
I haven't practiced in a long time

327
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,839
My hands are a little raw

328
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,799
I have to ask you later

329
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,799

Here you go

348
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,480
I thought the boss

349
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,519
worked while sitting

350
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,000
< b>I didn’t expect to be even busier

351
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,160
I used to

352
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,279
only have to face one boss

353
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,519
Now even though

354
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,440
I am my own boss 

355
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,519
I have to face more bosses

356
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,799
And my partner

357
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,160
What happened to the partner

358
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,160
I haven’t seen him I gave her a break

359
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,319
Looking at her working so hard

360
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,599
I’m too embarrassed to be lazy

361
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,759
What’s her name

362
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:27,799
Cong Shan< /b>

363
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,119
Did you send a text message to Shi Ran?

364
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,160
Let her come down

365
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
If Shi Ran

366
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:42,960
has time at night  >

367
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,119
Why don't you let her accompany you to dinner

368
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:45,759
What about you

369
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,480
I just remembered

370
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,640
There is still a job that has not been completed

371
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,519
< b>My partner is urging me every day

372
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,160
I have to go back to the company quickly

373
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,559
Get that document ready

374
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,119
Then go and do your work

375
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,160
Don't worry about me

376
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,920
How about this?

377
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,319
I'll finish the meal with you

378
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,440
 Can I go again

379
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,160
No need

380
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,279
It’s not you, why are you like this again

381
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
You won’t get angry again because of this little thing

382
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,680
 I'm angry

383
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm not angry

384
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,799
You said you're not angry

385
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,200
Look at your face

386
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
I almost fell down just now 

387
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,920
Have you seen it?

388
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Hello, hello

389
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,359

I'll get the wine

432
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,799
You're in the pet hospital every day

433
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,720
Or it’s a jujitsu gym

434
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,079
What kind of life do you have?

435
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,680
Aren’t you just divorced?

436
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,400
Why don’t you dare

437
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,799
What are you shouting for?

438
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,599
Stop talking

439
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,400
Why do you talk so much

440
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,440
Can you take care of yourself

441
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,480
 This is OK

442
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,279
What's wrong with friends saying this?

443
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,759
Do you think it's

444
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,359
It's messed up, it's messed up

445
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,319
 Turn over and over again

446
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,799
It seems it’s time to get married

447
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,839
Live together

448
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,000
As long as we live together

449
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,599
there won’t be any of this Question

450
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,039
We can eat together

451
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,440
Sleep together and go home together

452
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
How many years have we been talking about this topic?

453
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,640
What do you think? 

454
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,799
You know it in your heart

455
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,440
What are you anxious about?

456
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,759
Am I the only one who is anxious?

457
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,519
What do you want >

458
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,160

Look at you

462
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,359
I’m angry

463
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
Don’t you know me very well

464
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,799
What do you want me to do

465
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,039
Disappear from my eyes immediately

466
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,559
I can only disappear if you get off the car

467
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,759
What’s wrong with my hand

468
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,720
What’s wrong

469
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,039
Caught by Shi Ran’s cat

470
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,400
Okay

471
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,759
I’ll come over the weekend Compensate you

472
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,119
Think about what else you want to buy

473
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,119
Okay

474
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,279
I got off the car

475
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,059
How about

476
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,519
< b>How do you work with Shanshan?

477
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,039
Very good

478
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,160
She is a workaholic

479
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,440
She likes to work overtime more than me

480
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,640
 I have

481
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,519
been her father 's legal adviser for more than ten years

482
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,880
It seems that I

483
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,960
know the basics

484
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,680
What about Shanshan? I also know her well

485
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,160
Young and young

486
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
Have been a director of a listed company

487
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,279
She is really good

488
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,599
I am with her< /b>

489
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,359
Progressing very quickly

490
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,200
You are now quite old

491
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,039
It’s time to slowly consider getting married

492
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,079
If marriage and work b>

493
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,279
If we can think about it together

494
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,079
That would be perfect

495
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,440
Xuan Nuo is a good girl

496
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,519
Is she the only good girl

497
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,920
It’s hard to find people suitable for marriage

498
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,059
You 

499
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,160
Don’t think about things

500
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
too easily

501
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,440
I understand 

502
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
I will consider this matter carefully

503
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,559
What should I consider?

504
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,720
Marriage is not two people playing house

505
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,200
It needs to be carefully considered

506
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,759
You should know what you want

507
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,680
How are you doing with my mother

508
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,519
You don’t have to worry about our affairs

509
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,799
Just take care of your own affairs 

510
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,359
That's it

511
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,720
After a while

512
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,440
I will make an appointment with Shanshan and her family

513
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,440
Let's get together

514
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:29,640
You take good care of it

515
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,799
Wipe its eyes so clean

516
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,119
It’s good to eat it every day

517
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,519
Quickly take a picture for me b>

518
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,119
That’s right

519
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,680
The cat litter box and cat food

520
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,599
Five hundred in total

521
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,880
Reimbursement

522
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Scan it 

523
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,640
How many have been sold

524
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,799
? The transaction has not been completed yet

525
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,319
We just have a look first

526
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,599
Transferred

527
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:00,880
< b>Give me a push

528
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
Come here

529
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,039
I bought it for you yesterday

530
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
What is the festival? You gave me flowers

531
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,960
No What kind of festival is it?

532
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,319
I think it looks pretty

533
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,480
It suits you better

534
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
It’s that simple

535
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,720
It’s that simple

536
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,079
But it looks pretty

537
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,319
Then let me take a picture for you

538
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,640
Don’t look at my phone

539
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Don’t look at your phone

540
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What little secrets do you have

541
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,039
I have a lot of little secrets

542
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,759
When will it be over at your place

543
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,720
It will probably be evening

544
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,119
< b>Then prepare something delicious

545
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,440
I will go find you tonight

546
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,640
You quarreled with Peng Yuan again

547
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,000
My mother called me again 

548
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,160
Said that grandma is going to a nursing home

549
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,079
Internal and external troubles

550
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:48,599
Well, the cat mat

551
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,400

552
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,440

Mom

What’s wrong?

555
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:12,599
It’s noisy again

556
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,400
Look b>

557
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,920
She locked herself in the room again

558
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,839
Can’t come out

559
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,359
No matter how much I try to persuade her, she still won’t come out

560
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,359
My life is really miserable. 

561
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,400

I serve her every day with delicious food and drinks

565
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,039
She still treats me like this

566
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,400
She still thinks that I said I was not good to her

567
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,200
Okay, stop crying

568
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,160
Stop crying

569
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
You said I did it for her

570
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,240
I have never remarried

571
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,240

Who wants to live with you

00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,079
You Look at what she said. She

582
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:02,599
Okay, stop crying, stop crying

583
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,319
Okay, okay, okay

584
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,799
Don’t blame her for being fragile< /b>

585
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,200
It’s not easy for her either

586
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,759
With me, an old procrastinator

587
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,839
She is just like you

588
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,880
Both are only children

589
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,759
When she gets old

590
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,279
You will

591
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,559
do the same You are both right

592
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,160
I am not fragile either

593
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,799
I was just thinking

594
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,039
When I am old

595
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,119
Will you treat me the same way I treated her

596
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,599


597
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,759
Yes

598
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,240
You can’t send her

599
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,480
to a nursing home

600
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,480
Yes

601
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,599
After all, I can’t send her either 

602
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,359
Really send it there

603
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,240
Just talk and talk

604
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,079
You two have rehearsed it, right?

605
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,559
In the end, you are just urging me b>

606
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,799
Get married quickly

607
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,759
It’s better to have another child

608
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,640
A second child

609
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,160
Otherwise I will have no one to accompany me when I grow old b>

610
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,160
Is it rehearsed like this?

611
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,720
Is it rehearsed like this

612
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,759
You are already thirty

613
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,839
Peng Yuan can wait

614
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,680
You can't wait

615
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,640
We have our own plans

616
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,720
Don't look down on us

617
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,519
We can't rub the sand

618
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,799
You have finally come this far

619
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,000
You can guarantee

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,680
Break up with Yu An

621
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,440
Find someone better than him

622
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,160
Mom

623
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,200
What are you doing

624
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,920
I think the person who should get married

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,720
is you

626
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,640
I am here

627
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,359
I think that’s the case too

628
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,000
You old lady

629
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,880
It’s snowing

630
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,319
I haven’t even made an appointment

631
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,759
 Let’s make an appointment while walking

632
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,720
Sister Hong is gone

633
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,380
Let’s go

634
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:12,160
Goodbye Dr. Zhao

635
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:12,819
Goodbye

636
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:13,559
Zhao Doctor

637
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
Hurry up and make an appointment

638
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,640
Goodbye sister

639
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,640
He’s leaving

640
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,519
It’s too cold

641
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,359
< b>It’s too cold

642
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,519
Take a walk

643
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,599
I’m afraid I won’t sleep well

644
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,119
So I brought him a sleeping mat

645
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,039
I’ll just give you the test sheet

646
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:36,640
Let’s go in

647
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,799
Have you just raised a cat?

648
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:46,920
Not quite used to it yet

649
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,720
You don’t seem to be very good at it Raise a cat

650
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,960
Then I can learn slowly

651
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,960
Have you eaten tonight?

652
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,200
If not, I can treat you

653
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,039
I don’t I really like

654
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,480
eating with people I don’t know well

655
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,319
It’s not that I’m not very familiar with it

656
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,759
I just feel like

657
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,759
I’m not familiar yet b>

658
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,240
We can have dinner together

659
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:10,960
Understood

660
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,160
Then I’m leaving

661
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,220
Okay

662
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,840
You didn’t finish what you just said What?

663
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
Go on,

664
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,079
Now we have

665
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,320
officially talked about getting married

666
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,199
My mother desperately wants it anyway b>

667
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,920
What about Peng Yuan

668
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,199
He

669
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,360
don’t know

670
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,840
But he feels like he is escaping

671
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,039
What about you< /b>

672
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,159
Me

673
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,199
I was thinking anyway

674
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,599
The takeout should have arrived

675
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,840

00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,719

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,519
Okay Then go ahead

682
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360
How do you know I'm here

683
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,559
You're not following me, are you?

684
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:14,960
I don't want the test report

685
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:15,960
 Hello takeaway

692
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,719
Come back

693
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,639
Why have you been gone for so long

694
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,079
Nothing

695
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,519
This fried chicken is so delicious

696
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,679
Shi Ran 

697
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:03,880
Do you know who lives

698
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,800
above you    Up

699
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
I only know that

700
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,760
there seems to be a couple living

701
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
upstairs diagonally across the corner

702
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,719
 Couple

703
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,119
I guess so

704
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,000
I haven’t seen you a few times

705
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,119
Didn’t I just move here too

706
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:17,079
What’s up

707
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,719
Nothing

708
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,840
Just now I saw

709
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,800
A man came up

710
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:21,800
Quite handsome

711
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Quite handsome

712
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,599
How handsome he is

713
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
< b>Do you want me to go up and take a look?

714
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,199
Stop making trouble

715
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,440
But

716
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,559
If you are curious about someone

717
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:38,239
It means you I have begun

718
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,039
to be interested in this person

719
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,519
If

720
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,679
you fall in love with someone

721
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,760
now  that would be considered cheating. 

722
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,039
Scare you

723
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,000
Cheers

724
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,440
Cheers

725
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,920
I just misunderstood you

726
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,119
Sorry

727
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,320
< b>It’s so cold

728
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,320
It’s snowing

729
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,920
It’s too cold. Go back quickly

730
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,519
I won’t

731
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,199
wait for the bus with you 

732
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,840
Let’s take a look at the snow scene together

733
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,000
Coming, coming

734
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,559
Go back quickly

735
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,400
Let’s go

736
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:44,800
 Goodbye

737
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,440
Bye bye

738
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,199
Send me a WeChat message when you get home

739
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,039
Goodbye

740
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,119
Be careful on the road under the snow

741
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,039
< b>Thank you Dr. Zhao

742
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,159
Next time it snows

743
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,039
Not at the pet hospital

744
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,559
Let’s meet outside

745
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:08,960
Just us

746
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,079
