1
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,680
Grandma

2
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,359
Nono is back.

3
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,158
My mother

4
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,159
seems to be very

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,319
busy.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
I asked her what happened. She didn’t tell me.

7
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,599
She called me and said she wanted to meet.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,959
Now she ’s gone

9
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,480
and it smells

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
so good .

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,359
What’s going on

12
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,479
with her and

13
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,000
your dad

14
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,840
? I don’t know. I understand

15
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,239
. How about

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,680
you and Zhao Jin?

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,840
Last time your mother made such a fuss.

18
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,038
Is it okay?

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
It's okay

20
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,439
. My mother

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,879
repeats those words every time

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,280
and I can memorize them.

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,879
You know how to make me happy

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
and go out with me for a walk.

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Is it cold

26
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,638
or not?

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,240
I have survived another winter

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,479
, so I have to enjoy it.

29
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,560
Grandma

30
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,599
, what on earth did your mother

31
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,400
think ?

32
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,239
That man

33
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,039
, forget it. Speaking of him

34
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,599
, I get angry. My mother is against me.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,280
You are against my mother

36
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,199
. We are really a family.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,719
Why

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
don't you want to be your mother's daughter

39
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,680
? Be my granddaughter.

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Do I have a choice?

41
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,918
I'll beat you and

42
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,759
I'll tease you.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
This is my life. In the

44
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,000
next life,

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
we will still be a

46
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,400
family

47
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,359
. This life will last

48
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,560
only a few decades . When

49
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,919
you reach grandma's age,

50
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,879
you will know

51
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,479
that you have to live a good life for the present you.

52
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,039
Don't think about

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,639
what will happen in the next life.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
Don't even think about what

55
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,800
will happen in the

56
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,000
future. Live well

57
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,239
in the present moment in a down-to-earth way

58
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,120
. That's the most important thing,

59
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,000
you know?

60
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,679
I know, I know,

61
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,400
but who can not think about the future?

62
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,800
My mother is always

63
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,959
living for the future.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,719
Help me, take that,

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,199
help me, bring that

66
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,879
zipper over here. Come on

67
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,800
, bring over the zipper .

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,599
Can’t you hear me?

69
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:06,519
God, where

70
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,599
are you here?

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,399
Old fool,

72
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,639
zippers, zippers, zippers

73
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,800
are all here. I

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,040
'll give you a choice.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,480
You're so lazy.

76
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,360
I thought about it carefully.

77
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,360
Since Nono is determined

78
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,399
to break up with Yu An,

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,680
we can't afford

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,560
Yu An's money. Move,

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
I plan to pay him back,

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,480
not you.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,240
Why are you paying him back now?

84
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,399
The money was invested in us

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
and we can pay it back to him after we make money.

86
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,040
I don’t know

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
what you are thinking

88
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,399
. Think about it, we don’t have this kind of relationship

89
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,879
. If I can invest money for you, why do

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,000
n't you give it to me quickly

91
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,959
? Isn't it the same if you pay me back now

92
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,319
 

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,639
as if you made money ?

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,199
Then think about it,

95
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,439
we owe you a favor

96
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,800
, and besides, I'm not that bad with

97
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,720
you for a while.

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,439
It's not

99
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,079
unreasonable to

100
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,600
say that.

101
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,079
Well,

102
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,199
let's go to that store

103
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:17,879
and see

104
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,279
what we're in a hurry

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,040
about. This store must

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,759
have been gone

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,319
for a long time.

108
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,360
How can I still wait for you? You say that's

109
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,860
the case.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,279
I'll give it . The agent is calling

111
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,759
you. It’s not

112
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,560
about you. Why are you in such a hurry

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,439
? You’re not in such

114
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,759
a hurry. What about

115
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,240
money

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,000
? I ask you about money.

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,759
Did you gamble again

118
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,240
? Did you gamble again?

119
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,120
I’m just looking at you. Two days have gone wrong

120
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,759
and I don’t dare to ask you.

121
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,560
Do you know how many days I haven’t slept well

122
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,800
in the past few days ?

123
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,399
Didn’t you promise me

124
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
not to gamble anymore?

125
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,879
I always thought you could change .

126
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,680
I always thought we

127
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,240
could still live together.

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,560
You’re too much. I'm disappointed.

129
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Didn't you tell me

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,720
not to touch this money? So

131
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,920
I thought of a way.

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
I just want to treat this money as

133
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,199
the principal. If

134
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,720
I win, I can pay

135
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,719
back Xiao Peng's money

136
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,879
. We won't owe him any favors.

137
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,720
Didn't I also

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,639
do it for you and Nono?

139
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
I didn't expect

140
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,040
that I was unlucky at that time.

141
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:33,800
I told you

142
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,519
that if I was lucky,

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,240
don't tell me

144
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,079
. I wouldn't

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,279
really throw it away

146
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,779
. Do

147
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,699
n't, it's not what

148
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:49,639
I said.

149
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,699
You

150
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,839
are serious about this,

151
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,360
aren't you

152
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,439
Xiao Li ? Ah,

153
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,199
I would like to ask you,

154
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,399
can I

155
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,959
get a loan for

156
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,480
my annuity insurance

157
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,519
? OK, OK

158
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,000
, please help me go through it.

159
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,000
What procedures are needed

160
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,800
? Tell me,

161
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,560
OK, OK

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,279
, then I'll wait for your news. Goodbye.

163
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,040
Your

164
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,079
mother

165
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,000
doesn't seem to object much

166
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,160
recently. Zhao Jin,

167
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,879
what did she tell you ? I can see

168
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,560
that I don’t understand your mother.

169
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
In her eyes,

170
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,319
nothing is

171
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,519
more important than your happiness.

172
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,560
Didn’t you say that

173
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,759
you must have Zhao Jin in your life

174
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,079
to be happy

175
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,560
? Although I don’t know much about Zhao Jin.

176
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
I don’t know Jin very well

177
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,040
, but I can get a rough idea from

178
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,759
the way he treats his sister.

179
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,439
But

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,840
there are still a lot of stumblings in

181
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,159
the future , and sometimes

182
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,000
I even regret

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,399
it. Grandma knows

184
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,879
that

185
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,799
you have been very tormented during this period

186
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,480
of your life

187
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,360
. Part of the time, it

188
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,919
's all suffering

189
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:04,759
just for those few

190
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,919
happy

191
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,279
moments. When you have those happy moments,

192
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,279
you will feel that the previous suffering

193
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,519
is worth it .

194
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,360
Is there

195
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,759
something going on

196
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,960
between Nono

197
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,000
and Zhao Jin? No

198
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,679
, I'm just too happy.

199
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,079
Nono Ah,

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,240
you still don’t know

201
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,720
how it feels to be a parent.

202
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,919
The most difficult subject

203
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,879
in the world is to

204
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,159
raise children and

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
learn at the same time

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
. It’s like crossing the river by feeling the stones.

207
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,879
What’s more, your mother

208
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,799
only has a precious daughter like you.

209
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to understand her.

210
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,879
You see

211
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,440
, it’s already complete. Well,

212
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,000
thank you for taking care of it.

213
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you, uncle doctor.

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,480
I was so worried about whether Beibei could be cured.

215
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,199
I just played this jigsaw

216
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,639
puzzle when

217
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,839
I had nothing to do.

218
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
When I puzzled it , I wouldn’t

219
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,159
think about other things.

220
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
Uncle Zhao,

221
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,159
you have to save so many animals.

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,240
I’m worried. There must be a lot of time

223
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,960
. I'll give this to you

224
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,919
so you won't be bothered

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,799
. Thank you.

226
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,799
You're welcome.

227
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,519
Then let's go. Dr. Zhao

228
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,360
. I'll give it to you

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,039
. Thank you.

230
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,419
After

231
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,799
you go back

232
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,039
, take good care of it

233
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,120
and love it. Only

234
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,240
if you like it

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,159
can you like it. You know, I know.

236
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,159
Slow

237
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:52,600
down.

238
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you, Uncle Doctor.

239
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,240
Thank you, Uncle Doctor.

240
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,799
You 're welcome to

241
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,460
go .

242
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,559
If you have anything to do, go back first.

243
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm fine.

244
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,559
Then you can. Hold it in,

245
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,440
I think you're sick again.

246
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,799
Brother Yu'an

247
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:25,559
, I'll go over first.

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,220
Okay.

249
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:28,840
Brother

250
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,799
Xu Yang

251
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:36,720
has time

252
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,320
to practice together later. Let's do it

253
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,720
next time.

254
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,120
Today's classes are all scheduled

255
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,240
. How about

256
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,759
Zhao Jin?

257
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,039
He's still here. Yes,

258
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,559
are you sure

259
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,080
it's

260
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,559
because I heard that

261
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,039
he is not doing well?

262
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,679
You all know it.

263
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,960
Do you know some of

264
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:04,039
the promises who told you?

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
He is quite pitiful and he

266
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
has time. Please give him some advice

267
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,720
and comfort him. I see how far

268
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,279
you can go in pretending to be calm.

269
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,200
I 've always

270
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,879
been very calm

271
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,840
when I'm working.

272
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,559
My acting skills have improved recently.

273
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,279
I really don't plan to go to Zhao Jin.

274
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
I need time to think.

275
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,159
Not only has my acting skills improved,

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,039
but I'm also getting thicker and thicker. Even

277
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,200
though I

278
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,639
can't think of others anymore

279
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,519
, I still say I need to think.

280
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,519
I see you are thinking about what

281
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,919
you are doing,

282
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
so what do you mean when you

283
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,399
say that people who have been injured

284
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,639
are really scary?

285
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,080
Think about it,

286
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,960
how frustrated you were

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,799
when you were not recognized by

288
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,279
Peng Yuan's father.

289
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,559
Then Zhao Jin's situation now

290
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,759
is no better than yours. I was so strong at the time,

291
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
but you ignored

292
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,919
me and I felt very sad, okay

293
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,439
? I have things that I need to reflect on,

294
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,000
but you said that after hearing those words,

295
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,080
could I pretend that

296
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,159
nothing happened?

297
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,159
I also have a temper,

298
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,159
right? Yes,

299
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,960
you also have a temper and a temper.

300
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,480
Keep going.

301
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
Our business

302
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,840
is really not going well recently

303
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,600
. Should we ask the people around us

304
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,919
who want to get married

305
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
and win over business?

306
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,600
Why are you going

307
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,879
? Where are you going ?

308
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,759
Sister Hong,

309
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,799
why don’t Dr. Zhao

310
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
work hard? This

311
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
is not right.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,919
How old are you and you

313
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,159
are still playing jigsaw puzzle?

314
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,799
Are you trapped

315
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,240
? Is this jigsaw puzzle trapped

316
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,639
or are you trapped?

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,399
Come on, Sister Hong, help you figure it out

318
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,440
. I was so wrong just now

319
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,240
. Have

320
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
you broken up with Xunuo?

321
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,120
Who did you listen to?

322
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,199
I just met Peng Yuan

323
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,320
in the locker room.

324
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,360
He seemed to know

325
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,480
about you and Xunuo.

326
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,559
It’s true. Xunuo,

327
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,039
why are you so impatient

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,639
to tell Peng Yuan?

329
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you think they

330
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,120
can reconcile,

331
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,919
sister? Why are you going out

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,799
?

333
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,240
Zhao Jin, please

334
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,039
come in

335
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,240
and

336
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,799
practice typing.

337
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,000
Come on, do a group first.

338
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
Why are you here now?

339
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,440
I didn’t come here to find you

340
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,159
. You are busy with your business. Go to

341
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,879
what I told you on the phone.

342
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm not sure

343
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,200
. Don't be impulsive.

344
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm sensible. Don't worry.

345
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,480
Why do I have time to come here

346
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,559
to practice with

347
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,080
you?

348
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,799
I've already finished practicing for

349
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,120
a while today and I left beforehand.

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,679
I 'm afraid.

351
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,840
This is

352
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
the house where we got married.

353
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,919
Be careful

354
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:40,960
. Thank you

355
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,240
. It seems that

356
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,519
you are in a hurry.

357
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,399
I warned you

358
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,679
not to provoke Xu Nuo again.

359
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,559
Why are you afraid of losing to me ?

360
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,600
I told you that if

361
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,600
you do this again,

362
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,598
I will not be polite to you.

363
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,720
I also told you

364
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,118
that as long as you give up

365
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,159
, I will Give up. Do you

366
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
think she will reconcile with you

367
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,400
after I give up my promise ?

368
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,598
Who said I would reconcile with her?

369
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:17,519
You don’t have to be so surprised.

370
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,839
I told you a long time ago

371
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,960
that my intention

372
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,118
is for you

373
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,519
. In fact,

374
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,680
when we got married,

375
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:26,559
my mother didn’t either. I agree that

376
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,000
the situation is a bit similar to yours now

377
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,279
, but

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I loved him

379
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,599
very much at that time.

380
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Zhao Jin was handsome

381
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,200
and good to me. But we have lived together for a long time

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,599
. I wanted a better life

383
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,480
but he couldn’t give it to me

384
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,799
, so I just

385
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,200
told you this about Zhao Jin

386
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,759
. He doesn’t tell me

387
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,920
much about his past,

388
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
and I don’t ask

389
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,400
him much about

390
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,959
it. He keeps all

391
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,960
the bad things

392
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,079
in his heart

393
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,480
and wants to forget them.

394
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,319
But he doesn’t know when

395
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,680
these painful memories

396
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,599
will be brought back to him

397
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,359
sometimes. I feel

398
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
living with him is very depressing.

399
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,259
I

400
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,079
don’t know if you

401
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,079
feel this way.

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Last

403
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,679
time he drank too much.

404
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
I went to see him and he asked me if I

405
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,279
would abandon him too

406
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,000
. Is this why you came here?

407
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
I’m sorry that day.

408
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,200
Don't misunderstand

409
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,519
me. I knew he drank too much,

410
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,519
so I took the initiative to bring him sobering tea.

411
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,880
I know

412
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,119
, but

413
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,920
he told you that he was afraid that you would abandon him.

414
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
It was partly me ,

415
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
but I think the more important thing

416
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,519
was probably his mother

417
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
when she left home.

418
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,759
Zhao Qin seems to be about

419
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,039
the size of a stone and

420
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,599
has never been home since then,

421
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,680
so this is already a

422
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,279
topic that we cannot talk about.

423
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,879
If

424
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Xu Nuo wants to reconcile with me,

425
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,519
it is not unacceptable to me

426
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,519
, but

427
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,480
there is something I have to remind you

428
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,119
. I have known Xunuo

429
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,279
for a long time and

430
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
I know her very well. She is not a

431
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,559
woman who can be satisfied

432
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,799
only by love.

433
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,919
Your cheap romance

434
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,960
cannot satisfy her at all. Do you

435
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,639
know why I

436
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,000
am becoming so crazy now

437
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,039
? It is because of her

438
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,079
one day

439
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,279
you You will become just like me

440
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,079
. Thank you for your concern.

441
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,559
What I am going to say to you next

442
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,879
is not a warning,

443
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,399
it is a threat.

444
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,519
I don’t care

445
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,039
about what you said to me before,

446
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,839
but it involves my family

447
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,720
, so

448
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,559
I’m sorry. Wait,

449
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,200
I’m curious.

450
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:19,039
What can you

451
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,640
actually do after you come back?

452
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,799
I have thought about

453
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,919
getting back together

454
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,359
, but since I saw you,

455
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,399
this thought has been completely given up,

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
because I think

457
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
he has changed a lot

458
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,159
since being with you

459
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,079
, including his father,

460
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,720
his relationship with his father

461
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,680
, and Xiao Qin

462
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,000
, I am I really feel that

463
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,919
you are the one who can help him.

464
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,799
In fact, I didn’t help him with anything

465
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,680
. After two people get together, there will

466
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:20,599
naturally

467
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,680
be some changes . I

468
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,399
hope these changes

469
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,319
are good.

470
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
In fact, Peng Yuan

471
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,720
came to see me

472
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,440
before,

473
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,519
and so did he . I want to know

474
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,359
what happened to Zhao Jin before.

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Why are they so serious? Before today,

476
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,039
I had to endure

477
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
secretly taking photos of me and my sister

478
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,799
for the sake of my promise .

479
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,359
How do you think I would handle

480
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,039
it? I heard that your father did this.

481
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,839
How dare you provoke it? My dad

482
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,119
, why don't I try to

483
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:07,980
loosen

484
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,700
up ,

485
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,680
let go, let's really do it,

486
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
what's going on, are

487
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,480
you okay,

488
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,019
brother,

489
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
are you okay, what's

490
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,039
going on, don't fight back,

491
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:22,720
brother

492
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,279
, pull

493
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,680
Xu Yang, stop it,

494
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,240
stand back,

495
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,240
come over and eat,

496
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,359
I don't want to eat,

497
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,519
I want it. If you don't want to lose weight

498
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,839
, I'll pour it.

499
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,279
Pour one and give it a try.

500
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,480
I can't bear to

501
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,200
part with it. Why are you

502
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,759
coming back ?

503
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,920
Then I'm leaving. Did I let you go? Come here. Come and sit.

504
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,240
Come and sit

505
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,980
with me.

506
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,400
You have a taste of my salad

507
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,720
. Come on.

508
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,920
Eat some vegetable leaves.

509
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,079
What happened to

510
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,279
Xu Nuo and Zhao Jin

511
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,119
? It’s the Cold War period, right

512
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,119
? Zhao Jin.

513
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,119
Don’t mention it.

514
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,000
Who won the fight

515
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,119
with Peng Yuan today

516
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
? Is that the point

517
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,839
? What do you think will happen to

518
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,919
them ?

519
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,839
I don’t know

520
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
anyway. If they

521
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,880
break up,

522
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,960
why should

523
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,279
we break up ?

524
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,559
Because

525
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,839
you are Zhao Jin's good friend.

526
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,440
Zhao Jin and Xu Nuo break up.

527
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,599
I must stand by my sisters.

528
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,639
I must be righteous. If

529
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,480
they have problems

530
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,799
, we will quarrel.

531
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,039
They are going to break up

532
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,240
and we are going to break up too.

533
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,680
What's going on?

534
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,279
Haven't you heard

535
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,039
? This friendship

536
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,160
is stronger than the relationship between lovers,

537
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:01,960
isn't

538
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,359
it? You are jealous

539
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,359
and

540
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,759
I am angry. You are jealous of me and Xu Nuo,

541
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,399
so why not? It's

542
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,839
your fault for always

543
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:26,920
making me jealous.

544
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,880
You can find Zhao Jin.

545
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,960
He's not here right now

546
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,480
. Thank you, Sister Hong.

547
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,319
Can you have some

548
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,599
coffee? No, I'm leaving first.

549
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,839
Xu

550
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,380
Yuan

551
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,160
, are you

552
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,920
free tonight

553
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,160
? I

554
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,319
want to chat with you.

555
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,000
Are you free

556
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,119
? No problem,

557
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,440
okay, why

558
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,240
don't I bother you like this?

559
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,000
Find a place. Once

560
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,240
you've decided on the place,

561
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,640
send me a message and I

562
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,480
'll go find you.

563
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Then I 'll send you

564
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,799
the place I've decided

565
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,440
. See you later.

566
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,960
Why are you here? What

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,759
's wrong with your face?

568
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,240
Drive. I accidentally touched it

569
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,559
when I opened the door.

570
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,720
Can you

571
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:18,819
tell me ?

572
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,039
Wait until I get off work

573
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,000
and change places to talk.

574
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:23,920
What can I say?

575
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,359
Show your face.

576
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,640
Why are you here?

577
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,839
I'm here to see a doctor. I'm

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,960
so sad that I'm going to die.

579
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:43,799
I can't help but forget it. Is

580
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:57,919
Yu'an's

581
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,039
dad here

582
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,880
? Is it just the two of us?

583
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,839
Why did you order so many dishes

584
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,960
? Is there anyone else?

585
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,599
You will know in a moment.

586
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,160
I mainly

587
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,519
want to apologize to you.

588
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,759
You worried a lot about the promise you made before

589
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,799
, but now

590
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,400
everything has been resolved.

591
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,559
Is it worth it for you to do this to

592
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
a woman who has changed her heart

593
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,640
? She sympathizes

594
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,799
with that man

595
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,720
, but now she has figured

596
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,480
it out . Do you still want to get back

597
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,680
together with her? It depends on you.

598
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,959
You agree to it.

599
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,119
You didn’t treat

600
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,039
Xunuo when I was together

601
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,559
before. She

602
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
cares about her like a family member.

603
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,359
This has also caused

604
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,960
some conflicts between me and Xunuo.

605
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,079
Can you just help me?

606
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,759
Yuan

607
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,240
Xunuo’s mother,

608
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,480
Mr. Peng, are you here too

609
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,279
? Aunt Xu, please

610
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,559
sit down, sit down

611
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,119
, I’ll do it by myself,

612
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,799
don’t leave. Don't let me come.

613
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,039
Thank you,

614
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:19,599
auntie.

615
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,160
My dad is here this time

616
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,759
to discuss

617
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,039
my marriage with Xu Nuo.

618
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,720
Let's chat while we eat.

619
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,880
Xu Nuo's mother

620
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,519
doesn't know if the food here

621
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,799
is to your liking. You're welcome.

622
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,400
You're welcome. Very good,

623
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,879
my dad . In the past, drinking

624
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,240
was not good at work

625
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,200
, and he always felt that

626
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,759
there was someone else outside my mother.

627
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,720
Every time he drank too much,

628
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,720
he would beat my mother.

629
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,960
Although I understand, my mother

630
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,440
still resented

631
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,960
her. When she left, Xiao Qin was only seven years old.

632
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,599
Later, Xiao Qin I fell ill again.

633
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,480
I had just graduated from college and

634
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,839
my job was ordinary.

635
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,279
My father was also unreliable.

636
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
At that time, I knew that

637
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,599
I could only survive

638
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,720
by enduring it unconditionally

639
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
. Later, when I got married

640
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,640
and divorced

641
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,439
, it was a huge blow to me.

642
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,720
If I didn’t suppress it,

643
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,799
it would come up from time to time. I

644
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,839
may have really given up on myself

645
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,079
because of all kinds of emotions.

646
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,879
You endured it

647
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:48,480
for Xiao Qin.

648
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,000
That day, when I was drunk,

649
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,160
I called my mother.

650
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,559
I wanted her to come and see Xiao Qin.

651
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,079
Who knew that

652
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,240
she had changed her phone number?

653
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,839
Later Tian Muchu Come to me

654
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,519
, I burst out

655
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,400
without control for a moment.

656
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,400
You have done a good job.

657
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,160
I can't imagine

658
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,440
these things happening to me.

659
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,880
What should I do

660
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,279
? Thank you,

661
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,319
it should be me. Thank you

662
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
for what you thank me.

663
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,680
Thank you for believing in me

664
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,519
and willing to follow me. Thank you for sharing your scars

665
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:00,960
and

666
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,119
for being willing to bear it with me

667
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,039
when I had no self-confidence,

668
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,440
no matter whether it was good or bad.

669
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,599
These words sound

670
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,319
like they were spoken at a wedding.

671
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,960
Although they are simple words,

672
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,079
how much do you have to overcome

673
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,759
to achieve them? It’s difficult,

674
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,920
even though you have admitted your mistake

675
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,759
But

676
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,759
there is still no way to avoid punishment.

677
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,759
Promise Mom,

678
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,960
what do you think

679
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,720
about the children?

680
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,920
The

681
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,599
children have to decide for themselves.

682
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,119
As parents, we

683
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,839
respect the children’s opinions

684
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,119
, support them and protect them

685
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,200
. Are

686
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,440
you right? Auntie, you are so right. This

687
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,519
is indeed

688
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,879
a matter between me and Xu Nuo.

689
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,759
We plan

690
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,119
to get married this year

691
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,960
, so I came to see you.

692
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,960
I also want to discuss

693
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,039
the wedding date.

694
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,960
This major marriage matter

695
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,599
depends on

696
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,599
your wishes.

697
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Consensus is the most important thing

698
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,240
. But I am here today.

699
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,599
It's for another thing,

700
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,559
this

701
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,240
one, please put it away first,

702
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,319
Yu An.

703
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,839
I'm very grateful to you

704
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:57,960
for investing

705
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,200
in my laundry.

706
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:00,440
But I have

707
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,359
thought about it seriously

708
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,359
for a long time

709
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,240
. You see, I am too old and have

710
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
no brains. Well, if

711
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,159
this business thing

712
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,400
gets really big,

713
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,719
I'm afraid I

714
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:12,638
won't be able to take the responsibility. You said

715
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,599
it wouldn't be good for anyone if

716
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,639
we lose money.

717
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,000
You said yes,

718
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
so you can take the money

719
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,400
back .

720
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,440
Auntie

721
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,559
, I said

722
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,199
this. Don't take the money to heart.

723
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,039
In fact, this

724
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,599
is not an investment at all

725
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,000
, but a gift I plan to

726
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,000
give you. You should take

727
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,280
this money

728
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,599
back.

729
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,679
Yu An

730
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,320
promised himself something.

731
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,159
I really have no way

732
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
to make a decision for her.

733
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,400
I am doing it for her. She is good.

734
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,880
She must

735
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,840
not be with someone like Zhao Jin

736
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,719
. I know that

737
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:48,840
I know that

738
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,360
Zhao Jin's situation

739
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,800
is a bit special.

740
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,000
To be honest,

741
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,119
I sympathized with him at first

742
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:57,479
because his situation was not very good.

743
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,280
Later, I found out about this person's

744
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,519
character . You know about the problematic

745
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,159
photo, right?

746
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,760
There was some misunderstanding

747
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,599
between Xunuo and I before.

748
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,679
My dad was worried about me,

749
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,360
so he asked someone to investigate

750
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,039
the matter. I don’t need to explain it.

751
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,559
But what do you mean

752
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,719
when you say he has a problem with his character

753
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,000
? His sister is seriously ill

754
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,038
and needs a doctor. I spent a lot of money for surgery.

755
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,840
He wanted to use the photos

756
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,719
to blackmail me.

757
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,840
I will know

758
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,400
what kind of person he is.

759
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,840
I will know the money. You should take the

760
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,679
money back . I

761
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,599
will just eat as if it never happened

762
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,559
. I

763
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,400
’m really embarrassed.

764
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,639
Suddenly, I Remembering that

765
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,519
I have something to do in the store,

766
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,719
I won't eat.

767
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,920
You two eat slowly.

768
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,980
Thank you

769
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
for taking care of our family

770
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,919
over the years.

771
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,558
Thank

772
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:17,800
you. You 're welcome. Please go slowly.

773
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,619
Auntie, you don't

774
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,340
need to give me away. That's

775
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,039
enough

776
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,000
. It's not a business or

777
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,519
a business

778
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,760
, it's not an aunt's

779
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,440
thing. My dad

780
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,400
made a slip of the tongue.

781
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,239
Your dad didn't make a slip of the tongue.

782
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,039
What your dad said is the truth.

783
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,480
Your dad is a lawyer.

784
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,760
You are his son

785
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,239
. The lawyer's son

786
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,360
marries the daughter of a laundry owner

787
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,159
.

788
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,760
Don't tell me.

789
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
It's really a

790
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
loss-making deal.

791
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,238
Mommy promise. Don't make a mistake.

792
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,480
It was your family's promise that

793
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
your daughter hurt my son.

794
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,440
Come

795
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,599
on, don't pretend here.

796
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,039
You think I don't know

797
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,039
about Yu'an?

798
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,480
The girl from the Cong family, that matter

799
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,800
was not planned by you.

800
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:00,800
You have thought about

801
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,920
me. How do you feel about your daughter?

802
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,199
But it also applies to

803
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,199
your dad,

804
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,440
who is a lawyer. Some lawyers

805
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,000
are all about evidence

806
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,079
and not conscience

807
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,400
. If I had known

808
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,439
better , I should have taken more photos. Since

809
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,360
this is the case

810
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,519
, we have nothing to talk about.

811
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:17,280
To be honest,

812
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,599
I didn’t know

813
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,079
when I came here today. You're here

814
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,679
because we, Yu An

815
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,039
, are too stubborn.

816
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:24,440
Do you think

817
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
we'll sit together and

818
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,599
chat?

819
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:27,719
Do you think I'm willing?

820
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,719
He's stubborn. You teach him.

821
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,079
Are you not his father?

822
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,760
I can't communicate with people like you

823
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,480
. Hurry up and find someone who can talk to

824
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:35,840
you. I won’t excuse

825
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,000
you from communicating with my daughter.

826
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
Have a good meal.

827
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,280
Auntie

828
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,279
, sit down

829
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,199
and eat,

830
00:37:59,039 --> 00:37:59,920
don’t you want to

831
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,920
go home after eating? No, you don’t want to.

832
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,559
I’m not an alcoholic.

833
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,400
It was a mistake.

834
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,280
People will always

835
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,039
make mistakes. Mistakes are

836
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,000
personal and humane

837
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,519
. And wasn't it my first time? It

838
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,480
deserves to be forgiven the first time.

839
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:24,880
Otherwise, it's too inhumane.

840
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,599
There are so many things to say.

841
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,920
Should I send you

842
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,800
to an alcohol treatment clinic?

843
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,519
It's only a week

844
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,320
or two, but a month

845
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,760
is a long time. Once

846
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,840
a month.

847
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:53,960
Don't you want to?

848
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,780
Okay

849
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,679
, don't,

850
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,400
don't, don't be so serious.

851
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,719
Just write down that you must stop drinking.

852
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,760
If you violate

853
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,719
it, you are not allowed to tell me the wedding

854
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,440
date.

855
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,519
Don't forget to sign your name.

856
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,519
Why

857
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,679
are you here?

858
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,039
I didn't tell you.

859
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,800
Before you collect the money, do

860
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:36,840
n't come back

861
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,440
and open your phone

862
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,239
to see what

863
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,320
you are asked to open. Open it and see

864
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,880
where it came from

865
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,320
. Where did it

866
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,639
come from? You and I borrowed some money

867
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,320
. A card friend gave me face

868
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,800
and not only lent me the money

869
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,119
with interest. It's still low.

870
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,559
I even borrowed

871
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,360
the money to expand the laundry.

872
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,880
Let's live a good life in the future.

873
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,920
It's so risky.

874
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,280
It's so risky.

875
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,199
 

876
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,719
I didn't let Xu promise

877
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,239
to marry Yu An. It 's so risky

878
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,440
. I almost remarried you.

879
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:26,839
What do you mean? I

880
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,280
'll pay you even if you don't have any money. I came over

881
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,960
and my grandma has agreed that

882
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,920
we can be together.

883
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
Now it’s just my mom’s side.

884
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,480
We still need to work hard.

885
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,239
Grandma and aunties

886
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,440
know that they won’t support

887
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,280
me doing things like this

888
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,159
, but I understand them.

889
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,039
Just don’t be too anxious.

890
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,920
I’m not. I'm worried about myself.

891
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,199
I just feel like I

892
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,039
turned you into a sinner

893
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,119
for no reason.

894
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,519
If I told you that

895
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,079
I don't care at all

896
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,320
, I would definitely be lying to you

897
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,000
, but even so.

898
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,400
It's impossible to dampen

899
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,360
my enthusiasm

900
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,599
, but your existence

901
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:20,920
is not recognized by my family.

902
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,880
I know how it feels,

903
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,960
so can't you just accept me

904
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,559
? This is the most important

905
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:30,960
thing. Why do you look like this

906
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,000
? You don't recognize me.

907
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,519
You don't recognize me. ?

908
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,320
I think you are right.

909
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,960
I also think I am right.
