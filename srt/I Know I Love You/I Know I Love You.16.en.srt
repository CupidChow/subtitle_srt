1
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,719
Auntie, have you gone back?

2
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,439
Why are you

3
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
talking so softly?

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,319
We quarreled.

5
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,599
Why don't

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
I go find you

7
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,239
? I'm at the

8
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,238
door.

9
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,040
You won't be at my door.

10
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,359
You should have called me earlier

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,439
. Where

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,680
are you? I'm at my dad's place.

13
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,878
My waist is not good.

14
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,719
Is my sister at home?

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,359
She doesn't seem to be

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,439
fine .

17
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,038
I'll go back first

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,158
. No, no,

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,680
you come in and wait for me.

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,879
The password is 140719. The lock is

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,479
already unlocked

22
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,839
. Who is it?

23
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,279
I'm the promised boyfriend.

24
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,759
So you rang the wrong doorbell, right?

25
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,480
I don't have a boyfriend

26
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
, I only have a lover.

27
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,800
You wo n't be moved by me again,

28
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,959
will you? You are so easily moved.

29
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,079
What do you want

30
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,680
? Just do it.

31
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,399
Anyway , I have to kiss you

32
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,639
no matter what

33
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,480
. I'm so sorry.

34
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,600
I just visited

35
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,879
your home.

36
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
What does it mean

37
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,079
to come at the right time

38
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,000
?

39
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,160
It’s nothing.

40
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,800
Welcome to my

41
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,680
home. Xiao Qin, I

42
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,199
’ve been with that

43
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,000
Xiao Bai lately.

44
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,920
Don’t worry,

45
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,199
don’t worry.

46
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,839
They seem to be filming that

47
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,079
movie. I think Xiao Bai is a

48
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,199
pretty good

49
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,920
person.

50
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,600
The key is that as long as my sister is happy,

51
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,040
what book are you reading?

52
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,360
This is what

53
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,839
Sister Hong gave her.

54
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,240
She said it’s very good.

55
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,519
Read this paragraph to me.

56
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,480
Use

57
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
the voice you used when you called

58
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
me for the first time

59
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,759
. We love each other deeply

60
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,680
but Looking at each other in silence at this moment,

61
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,360
the silence is not because

62
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,279
the best moment has passed

63
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,040
but has not yet arrived. But it is

64
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
growing secretly

65
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,879
in the present moment

66
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,319
. We dare not say one more word

67
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,639
, fearing that time will slip away for a second

68
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,279
and there will

69
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,360
be more. Thank

70
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,000
you

71
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,759
. I fell in love.

72
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
That’s what you say.

73
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,319
I can’t seem

74
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
to

75
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,439
tell my

76
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,360
mother that you

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,319
’ve done a good job.

78
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,759
What’s wrong?

79
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,199
I’m fine.

80
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,439
You just need to take your time.

81
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,920
You always say that

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,199
. You're not comforting me,

83
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,040
you're afraid, right

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,959
? I'm afraid you'll be sad alone,

85
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,639
and I can't help you.

86
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
I almost have no confidence. The words

87
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,000
I told you before that

88
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,160
won't hurt you

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,360
may not count . Why should

90
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,199
I ?

91
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,920
It may hurt you,

92
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,879
it may make you sad.

93
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,639
In the end,

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,079
it may make you hate me

95
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,600
.

96
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,160
And

97
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:15,800
the person who

98
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,240
makes you feel pain in the end

99
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,439
may be me.

100
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
Just don’t use this

101
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,360
as an excuse.

102
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,639
What excuse?

103
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,600
It’s like saying Everything

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
is for my own good.

105
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,399
Then

106
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,839
use this kind of excuse to leave me in the future

107
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
. Let me guess. Are you right?

108
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,480
I

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,039
was told right by you.

110
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,120
Do you still want to run

111
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
? You know me quite well,

112
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,200
so you have to hold on tight

113
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,959
like now. Don't let go

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,440
of my hand, you know?

115
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,000
It hurts Zhao Jin.

116
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,240
I won't let go

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,120
. What does he want to do

118
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,399
? He wants to hit someone.

119
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
It feels like a war is about

120
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,159
to break out. You'd better stay away.

121
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
Will you hit someone for me?

122
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,840
You may not. I'm sleeping.

123
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,080
I may. I'm going to a

124
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,919
place far away.

125
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,360
I don't know

126
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,799
how far away

127
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,120
I am. Will I still be able to see you?

128
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,759
If I can't see you again

129
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,600
, I wish you good morning.

130
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,799
Where is

131
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,039
that boy?

132
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,639
Take your time and look.

133
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,360
Then do you think the two of them

134
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,639
are in love

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,799
?

136
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,799
I think they

137
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,159
are

138
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
together in the end.

139
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,519
When you see the end, you will know that

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,519
the universe is bigger and life is bigger

141
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,440
. Maybe we will meet again

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,919
in the future. Then we will make a wish to the sea breeze.

143
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,639
What's the matter with you in

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,639
"Meet the Mountains and Seas"

145
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,759
? You should make a

146
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,240
movie that makes people happy in

147
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
the future

148
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,159
. I'll try my best.

149
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,220
No , let

150
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
's work hard together.

151
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,360
We haven't gotten up yet

152
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,519
. How much did you drink? It

153
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
's rare for you

154
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
to have such a leisurely day during the workday.

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,320
Why don't you come out and stay for a while? It's great.

156
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,879
What are you thinking?

157
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,879
Sometimes when I'm eating

158
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,000
alone and on my way home,

159
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
I think about

160
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,720
how great it

161
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,360
would be

162
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
to eat and chat outdoors on

163
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,759
a sunny day

164
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,639
with the people I like.

165
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,439
I think I will. Is there such a day?

166
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,159
Although this idea is very simple

167
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,519
, I hope that

168
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,519
I will also have such a day.

169
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,440
This should be regarded as a

170
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:35,879
small wish

171
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,679
. Although it sounds

172
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,799
nothing special

173
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,679
, it is still difficult to realize

174
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,439
for many people

175
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,799
. What do you have?

176
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,840
A small wish?

177
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,279
It’s me.

178
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,240
I want to walk in a wet

179
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,039
alley

180
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,240
in the afternoon after it has rained

181
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
. Wouldn’t it be more comfortable

182
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
if it snowed?

183
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,299
Forget it

184
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,879
, no matter if it rains or snows,

185
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,159
we can all be together next time. It’s best if we

186
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,399
can have another drink. Coffee

187
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,600
depends on your performance.

188
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,759
Then don't ask me out.

189
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,480
Maybe

190
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,120
I will be very busy

191
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,240
at that time.

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,159
Well, please be patient. It's too

193
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,960
bad.

194
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,199
You secretly photographed me. It

195
00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,759
looks pretty.

196
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:00,600
Let me see

197
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,480
and send it to you.

198
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,320
Are you thinking about

199
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,399
the photo now? Why is this person

200
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
so good-looking?

201
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,799
He is very good-looking.

202
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,580
Zhao Jin

203
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,759
, you are not allowed to

204
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,639
tell me in the future. Forget it. No, no.

205
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,759
You can only agree on

206
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,240
something

207
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,120
. You promise me first. You

208
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,000
have to tell me what it is

209
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,639
before I can promise you.

210
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,000
Promise first. Well,

211
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,679
I will definitely

212
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,919
be bullied by you in the future

213
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,559
. Isn’t that what I should do?

214
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,240
Come on, tell me

215
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
so I can promise you. Let ’s go out

216
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,240
with your sister and Xiaobai.

217
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,159
Okay, that’s all

218
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,079
. What

219
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,598
I want to say is that

220
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,240
if you want to

221
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,279
get discouraged easily, If you do

222
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,880
n't, I won't be with you

223
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,319
. Hello

224
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,740
, sister

225
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:37,879
Nuo.

226
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,240
Hello, sister Nuo.

227
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,960
I had a two-hour

228
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,599
lunch .

229
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,039
What kind of meal are you eating?

230
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,519
A Valentine's Day limited set.

231
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,240
On the way back

232
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,319
, I just thought about

233
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,279
telling my mother

234
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,599
everything about Zhao Jin

235
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,400
when I see her next time

236
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,480
. Didn't your mother already

237
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,960
catch Zhao Jin showing up

238
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,480
? What she doesn't know

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,079
is actually what she should know.

240
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,240
She already knows it,

241
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,119
but I haven't

242
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,119
formally introduced it yet.

243
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,119
Then if you do this,

244
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,559
organize it

245
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,960
for them to have a meal or something.

246
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,440
I can imagine

247
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,359
what the result will be like.

248
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
My mother

249
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:18,559
must have broken up on bad terms

250
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,279
. She just feels that

251
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:20,480
Zhao Jin's conditions are not good.

252
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,920
You said

253
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,400
that if she waits for her

254
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,759
to know more about Zhao Jin,

255
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,359
she will agree.

256
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,000
She is your mother, not mine . Do

257
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,159
you think she will?

258
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,519
It's a bit difficult

259
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,799
for me to go again. Think about it,

260
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,000
does your mother know that Zhao Jin is divorced?

261
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,919
I forgot whether I

262
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
told her

263
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:45,880
what's wrong

264
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,599
.

265
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,359
What

266
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,680
is there that you don't know about Zhao Jin

267
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,880
? What do you mean

268
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,400
? Do

269
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
you know everything about him

270
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,039
? He carries it. I really don’t know about

271
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,079
the number of moles on my face.

272
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,240
Do you know about his ex-wife?

273
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,319
Why should I know

274
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,319
about his ex-wife

275
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,339
? Don’t you

276
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,400
want to know more about it

277
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,119
? What on earth

278
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,799
are you trying to say? I mean,

279
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,319
don’t I think?

280
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,440
Just two people together,

281
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,279
we have to

282
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,880
get to know each other better,

283
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:27,579
right?

284
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,039
The main reason is because I'm afraid that you might have something to

285
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,279
fall into your mother's hands.

286
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,759
Why are you acting

287
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,759
so weird today

288
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:38,720
? What's wrong with me? Did you do something

289
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,400
bad

290
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,079
? It's no use asking for

291
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,640
anything. What can I do to

292
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,759
hurt

293
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,559
you? Aren't you worried

294
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,079
about me?

295
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
My mother is worried about me

296
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,200
too. Peng Yu'an is

297
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,000
also worried about me. I'm worried about jumping into the fire pit.

298
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,559
I'm different from what they worry about.

299
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,440
It's useless to worry.

300
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
I've already jumped.

301
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,440
Is anyone

302
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,399
here ? Here

303
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,720
are your washed clothes.

304
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,119
Thank you.

305
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,200
This is for washing, right?

306
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:19,859
No,

307
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,319
here are

308
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,159
the old clothes we don’t want

309
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:21,919
.

310
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,159
Our laundry doesn’t accept old clothes. So

311
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,200
you can take them away and throw them away for me.

312
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,839
Thank you, that

313
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
’s really interesting

314
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,519
. You just throw

315
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,400
the unwanted ones underground

316
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,440
and they say they are given to us.

317
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,359
If you say it’s funny or not,

318
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,759
they treat us like garbage collectors

319
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,159
. In fact, they just want you

320
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,920
to help throw away the garbage.

321
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,799
Now many people

322
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,079
are willing to let the delivery guy

323
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,740
If

324
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,279
the courier delivers

325
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,759
the garbage,

326
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:55,839
I'll throw the garbage

327
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,880
in his face

328
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,160
. So let's just say

329
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,319
you can't do business.

330
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,079
In business, you

331
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,599
don't have to have good relationships with people. If

332
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,680
you help to throw the

333
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,720
garbage away , it's just a convenient thing

334
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,039
to throw away. Well,

335
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,359
I can't stand this angry

336
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,799
person. Who in this world

337
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,960
can't be angry?

338
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,480
By the way,

339
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,680
the emperor can't be angry

340
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,480
, but you don't have that fate.

341
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,519
Are you deliberately angry with me? Did I

342
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,519
provoke you to provoke you?

343
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,759
Didn't you provoke me

344
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
? Tell me about you.

345
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,440
As soon as I went out, I

346
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
didn’t answer my phone calls. I

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,359
didn’t reply to messages. I

348
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,279
went out for a whole day and I didn’t even know

349
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,119
what you were doing

350
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,000
. My daughter’s matter hasn’t been resolved yet.

351
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,079
You, you, started making trouble again.

352
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,079
I’m the one who got the upset,

353
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,960
okay?

354
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Why are you crying?

355
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:37,900
You

356
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,359
, you. Tell me honestly,

357
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,799
what on earth did you do

358
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,900
? No

359
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,200
, I

360
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,519
didn't do anything. Did you go to play mahjong

361
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,660
?

362
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,880
Look

363
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,720
at your expression.

364
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,000
You must have gone to play

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
mahjong

366
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,079
. Did you

367
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,319
? I didn’t dare to tell you that

368
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,960
you really went to play mahjong.

369
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
You

370
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,279
, you, what did you tell me

371
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:58,799
? I

372
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,079
played mahjong for peace,

373
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,519
not for gambling.

374
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,160
You want to piss me off.

375
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,039
I didn’t gamble

376
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,920
for money. I really

377
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,400
didn’t gamble for money.

378
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,680
I swear not to cry.

379
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,559
It’s so beautiful. The clothes

380
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,359
are all gone

381
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,439
. They look quite new

382
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:16,440
. They still have hang tags. Look,

383
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,319
look, look. They

384
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:19,920
are not cheap.

385
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,160
There is also

386
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,160
a message I sent you.

387
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,599
It has

388
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:28,000
the phone number of the person who collects the old clothes.

389
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,759
He can donate it to impoverished mountainous areas

390
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,720
. What can he do? Why are you

391
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,399
not allowed to see

392
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,359
that you have secrets?

393
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,480
It's not your

394
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,720
problem

395
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,919
. Today's class ends here.

396
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,960
After class, everyone stretches.

397
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:49,799
After class,

398
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,759
Yu An,

399
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,279
let's withdraw first.

400
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,920
Let's have a drink together

401
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
. We haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's have

402
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,440
a drink together.

403
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's forget it.

404
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,400
It won't be because of Zhao Jin.

405
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,400
I know you are good friends

406
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,960
, but don't let him

407
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,399
affect our relationship.

408
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,159
It won't affect your overthinking.

409
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,119
Xu Yang is afraid of you

410
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,799
because of his relationship with Zhao Jin.

411
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,039
If you feel uncomfortable,

412
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,960
we will handle

413
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
the matter between Zhao Jin and

414
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,799
me ourselves. It has nothing to do with us.

415
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,680
You don’t have to worry

416
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,160
. I understand and

417
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,240
I won’t disturb

418
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,079
the two of you two.

419
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,440
What does he want to do?

420
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,480
How do I know that

421
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,960
he is going to start practicing boxing every day recently?

422
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,559
Have you watched too many TV shows about

423
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,720
the Zhao Jin duel ?

424
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,319
Can Peng Yuan beat Zhao Jin? I could

425
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:06,960
n't beat him before.

426
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,159
It's hard to say now.

427
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,200
Zhao Jin doesn't go to class now,

428
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:10,879
right?

429
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,480
I asked him to stay away from here.

430
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,059
What do you think

431
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,480
if the two of them encounter

432
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,879
this? How embarrassing!

433
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,279
Does Zhao Jin have

434
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,200
a son? I

435
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,079
saw him pick up a child

436
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,960
that day and

437
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,440
the two of them were talking and laughing.

438
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,119
It felt like picking up the child from school.

439
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,119
It was impossible .

440
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,079
If he had a child,

441
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,240
would I know? What if

442
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,359
it was ten

443
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,000
thousand ? First, his ex-wife

444
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
didn’t tell him about the child.

445
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,880
It’s not impossible. It’s

446
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,359
terrible.

447
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,839
Our family promised

448
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,599
to marry Zhao Jin today

449
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,599
. Now she wants to be a stepmother.

450
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,480
Okay,

451
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,319
don't worry about it,

452
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,359
hurry up and eat the dumplings.

453
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,680
According

454
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,839
to Zhao Jin's character,

455
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,480
if he has a child,

456
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,960
he will

457
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,599
definitely

458
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,799
tell Xu Nuo,

459
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,519
but that

460
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:06,839
's not

461
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,759
necessarily

462
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,799
the case .

463
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,720
Okay,

464
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,240
whose child is it?

465
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,720
Then why don't you let Xu Nuo

466
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,640
ask him directly?

467
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,200
Do you think I haven't thought about it?

468
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,559
I can't tell you every time.

469
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,880
The lights in their house are still on

470
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:27,919
. Do you think I should

471
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
go up and ask him

472
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,920
? Let's go

473
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,519
, wait a minute, wait

474
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,039
a minute,

475
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,240
what's wrong ? I

476
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,279
haven't thought

477
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,119
about it.

478
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,759
You said Xu Nuo did

479
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,920
n't even know about it. Should

480
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,039
I tell her

481
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,039
, why don't you tell her? Tell her, why don't you tell her?

482
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,959
Isn't it? It's not that simple.

483
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,460
You said

484
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,240
Xu Nuo was me. Good friends

485
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,680
, especially girls,

486
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,559
can't talk about this kind of thing.

487
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,559
So, for example,

488
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,079
if you

489
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,000
are like this one day , if

490
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,559
Xuanyu sees you with another girl

491
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
from the street

492
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,880
, do you think she will tell me?

493
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,159
What girl

494
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,720
? Then we are better than

495
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,599
you. He's more dangerous than me, okay?

496
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,720
Let me tell you the real thing.

497
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,079
Don't interrupt me all the time. It's so hard to

498
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,920
talk to you now. It's so hard to talk to you.

499
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:08,839
I'll just call him

500
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,420
Zhao Jin.

501
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,460
Don't ask

502
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,960
you

503
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,839
to come down.

504
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,640
It's not you

505
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,279
who I'm calling in the middle of the night.

506
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,679
Think about it, think

507
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:16,680
about it, don't

508
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
worry, call

509
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:22,440
Zhao Jin

510
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,680
first

511
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,480
. What are you doing? Let me ask you something.

512
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,680
Shi Ran saw

513
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,240
you holding a child that day. Whose family is

514
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,700
good ?

515
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,039
What did he say? Let's go

516
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,640
up

517
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,880
and

518
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,480
walk around.

519
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,759
Anyway,

520
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:43,039
this is what it is now. Look at

521
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,399
the situation.

522
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,319
I said it's

523
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,759
okay. It's okay

524
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,240
. The situation is very complicated now.

525
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,759
We haven't figured out

526
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:52,680
what Tian Muchu

527
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,079
wants to do.

528
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,399
I think your idea is

529
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,039
very similar to Sister Hong. She just

530
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,359
has a child by herself

531
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,399
. What is she doing

532
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,119
with me ?

533
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,599
It doesn't have anything to do with it.

534
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,039
Then do you think

535
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,880
she would think so if

536
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,400
you promised her? Will

537
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,480
she be happy? You wouldn't have treated

538
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,200
this matter with you

539
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,519
if you hid it from her. I'm not saying that I deliberately hid it from her.

540
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,279
I just didn't find

541
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:14,960
the right time

542
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,199
to tell her about it.

543
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Why don't you tell her

544
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,839
? Why did I tell her that

545
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,519
you said she is more receptive?

546
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,680
Okay, stop talking.

547
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,920
I told her myself. It's better for you

548
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,900
to

549
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,599
tell her yourself.

550
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,920
You have to tell her yourself

551
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,400
that this is the bride's bouquet. The flowers

552
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,839
are so beautiful. Do

553
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,759
you still remember this?

554
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,559
Didn’t you tell me

555
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,440
that you met

556
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,200
on the plane

557
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,160
? So I specially

558
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,839
designed this

559
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,559
. I hope that your good fate

560
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
can be passed on to others in the future.

561
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,440
This

562
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,160
is the design

563
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,559
.

564
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,079
You I can give it to

565
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:05,960
your relatives and friends.

566
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,839
Hi,

567
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,720
do you need any

568
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,799
help?

569
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,759
I'll take a look first

570
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,639
. Thank you.

571
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,259
Okay. It

572
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,440
's not wasteful and it looks good.

573
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:22,720
You can also choose

574
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,200
this one

575
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,500
. It

576
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,960
also looks good.

577
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,240
Look at this one and this one.

578
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,159
These are all designs. This

579
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
is quite nice.

580
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,359
This flower is actually very special.

581
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
I went over first.

582
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,359
Thank you

583
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:43,980
. Okay.

584
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,160
We want the freshest flowers.

585
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,159
The freshest flowers.

586
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,679
The freshest flowers

587
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,039
. They are usually

588
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,839
sent out on the same day

589
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,380
in Yunnan. Hello

590
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,399
, can you help

591
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,279
me ? Look again

592
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:00,920
. Thank you.

593
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,039
These are your flowers. They are

594
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,079
so beautiful.

595
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,359
True love comes

596
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,079
first. I

597
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:15,839
wish you

598
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,380
happiness

599
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,639
every day.

600
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,240
Thank you for coming back.

601
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,599
What was

602
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,000
that person doing here just now? Who is it?

603
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,079
The woman who just went out

604
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,079
came in and looked at the flowers for a while and then left

605
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,519
. Do you know me or

606
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,279
not

607
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
? They haven’t eaten for a day.

608
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,559
Could it be that they have

609
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,079
some kind of chicken plague?

610
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,119
It’s probably not chicken plague

611
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,720
. Chicken plague strikes very quickly

612
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,639
and dies easily.

613
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,119
They’re in pretty good condition. It

614
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,639
’s probably due to indigestion.

615
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,199
My chicken won’t die.

616
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,759
The chicks hatched in the school laboratory

617
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:30,759
that you delivered just in time and

618
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,559
won't

619
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
die are kept as babies.

620
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,319
I don't know

621
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,359
what to do

622
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,400
when they grow up.

623
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:38,799
I will prescribe medicine

624
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,519
and then mix them in the feed

625
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,640
and eat them together.

626
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:42,960
It'll be fine.

627
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,079
Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye

628
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,599
, brother. Are you

629
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
here?

630
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,160
I think

631
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,480
this plan is very good.

632
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,039
If there is no problem

633
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:26,640
, let's move forward

634
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,039
. Do you have any other opinions?

635
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:41,599
Hey ,

636
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,000
uncle

637
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,279
, it's me Yuan.

638
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:45,799
Do you have time?

639
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,000
I want to chat with you.

640
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:49,959
I'm doing laundry. The store

641
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,839
is good. I went over to find your

642
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,279
aunt, too

643
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,480
. Let

644
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,519
's meet in a while

645
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,159
and wipe this place

646
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,900
. Hey, Peng Yuan

647
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,160
. What do you mean by going

648
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,480
to uncle's place

649
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,480
? Peng Yuan went to my dad

650
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,240
, but no, no, not sure.

651
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,839
Dahao said, yes,

652
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,440
he said. I don’t know

653
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,039
what he wanted to do

654
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,000
when he went to the laundry.

655
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,720
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

656
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:36,879
I’ll take care of

657
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,960
it. I can’t hide

658
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,880
behind you all the time.

659
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:54,819
Aunt

660
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:56,579
Yuan,

661
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,559
come on, come

662
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:58,799
on, come on. Come in and sit down.

663
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,279
I won’t sit down.

664
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,019
Uncle, where is

665
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,400
that old Ren ?

666
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,319
Yu An is here,

667
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,399
sit down for a while.

668
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,559
Xiao Peng is here,

669
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,640
uncle. This is for you.

670
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,880
Xiao Peng is here

671
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,480
and he has brought you something.

672
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,599
You can see it is a

673
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,680
good thing. Look at the

674
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,640
packaging. I heard that you want to expand the store.

675
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,799
Have you found a place?

676
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,759
The place has been found a long time ago

677
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,559
, but the investment

678
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,839
has not been finalized yet.

679
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:23,680
I blame it on me

680
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,440
a while ago. The company has something

681
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,279
to do and has been busy with

682
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,839
this. Leave it to me . How

683
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
much money do you need

684
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,559
? Why are you so sad?

685
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,480
What's wrong?

686
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:43,619
Come and

687
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,119
give you a wedding candy.

688
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,039
I 'm very happy.

689
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,799
This is my gift. I gave it to you

690
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,519
. Peng Yu'an went to find my dad

691
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,960
or Zhao Jin told me.

692
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,279
Then

693
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,440
he didn't sound happy

694
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:00,399
, but he

695
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
told me before that

696
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
it didn't matter

697
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,079
. I don't know what Peng Yu'an meant.

698
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,240
He won't let you go.

699
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
It's not that he won't let me go.

700
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,480
He won't let himself go.

701
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,480
He won't let him go. Zhao Jin

702
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,519
doesn't want to take care of it.

703
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,119
You answer the phone first. I'll go and

704
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,079
feed you.

705
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,659
Sorry,

706
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,039
I was a little anxious just now.

707
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
I can't do this .

708
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
It's your responsibility.

709
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,199
What you said

710
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,920
will only make me feel

711
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,039
more embarrassed .

712
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,280
I want to see Peng Yu'an.

713
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,960
If you go,

714
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,599
he will only say hurtful things to you.

715
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,400
But if he meets

716
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,280
his uncle and aunt first

717
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,599
, it will be more difficult for you.

718
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,860
I hope

719
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,800
he can. Frankly speaking

720
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,760
, I don't want to

721
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,119
mean anything.

722
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,079
This is my business.

723
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:00,880
I should

724
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
tell my uncle and aunt in person.

725
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,559
I can't keep

726
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,760
letting Peng Yuan do this

727
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,000
. Let me give him a call.

728
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,079
What I mean is that

729
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,480
Peng Yuan's target is not you,

730
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,239
but me and

731
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,079
him. I can't accept

732
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,480
that the person you're with

733
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,360
is me. I'm

734
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,760
sixty-nine.

735
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
I should

736
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,639
n't. Don't you believe

737
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,239
what I'm telling you

738
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,800
? No, look at

739
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,760
how high-end the packaging is.

740
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,719
I won't go to dinner tomorrow.

741
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,440
You can go by yourself.

742
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,159
Didn't he say that he wanted to? Don't worry, I'll

743
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,800
sign the contract alone .

744
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,599
Don't worry, don't tell

745
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,119
me that I'm still worried about you. It

746
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,639
smells good.

747
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,119
Brother

748
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,480
, I saw someone

749
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,679
in the flower shop today.

750
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:04,559
He looked

751
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:07,678
a bit like Ms. Tian. Why

752
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,199
did she come back? Did

753
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
she go to your shop? Why

754
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,679
is it really her? Why

755
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,480
is she back?

756
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,440
You didn't say anything. There

757
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:16,880
is no need to say it.

758
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,199
Then does Sister Xunuo know

759
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,239
? It's wrong for you to do this . How

760
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,320
does she know where your

761
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
store is? The

762
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,519
point is not

763
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,440
how she knows

764
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,119
where our store is.

765
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
The point is, what is she doing when she comes back

766
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,679
? How do you know

767
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,000
what's going on? You have

768
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,000
to make a video call.

769
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,599
How do

770
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,679
I know? If you don't pick up, I'll pick you up.

771
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:44,800
I'll come by myself.

772
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,840
I'll come by myself . Shitou, please ask uncle, good

773
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,159
uncle, good

774
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,159
stone, good

775
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,199
stone.

776
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,519
I miss you. I haven't seen you for a long time. I'll

777
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
send it to you in the afternoon.

778
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,480
If you haven’t replied to the message

779
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,719
, you must ask me

780
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,639
to make a video call for you

781
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
. I have been clamoring

782
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,159
for you to come to my house to play.

783
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,319
That

784
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
uncle has been a little busy recently

785
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,400
. I will go to see you in a while.

786
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,639
Shi Shi’s birthday is the day after tomorrow.

787
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
You must come.

788
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Uncle, please accompany me. I'm here to celebrate my birthday,

789
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,019
okay,

790
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:15,920
great,

791
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:16,920
uncle. Goodbye

792
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,719
, right? You really want to go. The

793
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,000
child is very pitiful. So

794
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,360
what should I

795
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,079
do with Sister Xu Nuo ? How

796
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
can you explain it to her? I will explain it to her.

797
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,280
This matter

798
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,559
cannot be explained clearly.

799
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,599
As long as you two

800
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,519
I can’t explain the fact that

801
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,079
we are still in contact.

802
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,360
Your sister is more mature than you

803
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,880
. Even if she can understand

804
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,199
, she will still be unhappy. Do

805
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,800
you want to see Sister Xu Nuo unhappy?

806
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,719
OK ,

807
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,480
your brother

808
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,719
will handle it on his own.

809
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:46,559
Trust me,

810
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,000
why do you

811
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,039
want to put your feelings aside ? Things

812
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,239
are so complicated,

813
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,800
why don't

814
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,400
you

815
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,119
keep things

816
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
simple? Okay,

817
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,960
okay

818
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,960
, don't

819
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,119
talk about

820
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,159
me

821
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,320
, okay

822
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,679
? He

823
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:14,800
can’t laugh?

824
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,199
He

825
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,079
’s not smiling from the bottom of his heart.

826
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,360
I want to make him happy

827
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,039
. Let me teach you a joke.

828
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,880
One day, Uncle Wang is here.

829
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,760
I haven’t told you yet. Why are you laughing?

830
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,159
You look so funny.

831
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
One day, Uncle Wang

832
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,440
is in the tree. We were playing chess

833
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,440
, and then the young man came over and said,

834
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:37,559
"Master,

835
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,480
let's see if you like it.

836
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,239
It's not bad

837
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:02,639
. Peng Yu'an

838
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,760
, you don't have a crush on me.

839
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,920
Give me such an expensive bag.

840
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,559
Let me tell you.

841
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:07,800
My relationship with Xu Yang

842
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,340
is very stable

843
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,599
and we cannot tolerate third parties." You 're overthinking

844
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,639
it.

845
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,119
I'm not interested in other women

846
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,400
besides Xu You.

847
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,000
It must be hard for

848
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,440
you to help Xu Nuo take care of the flower shop

849
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,599
all these years

850
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,960
. But your flower shop

851
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,039
shouldn't make much money

852
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:23,559
.

853
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,360
We've known each other for so many years.

854
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
Can you tell me? Just say it directly

855
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,800
and stop beating around the bush.

856
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,239
I want you to help me redeem Xu Nuo.

857
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,679
There was some misunderstanding between Xu Nuo and me.

858
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,320
She should have told you

859
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,840
, but those things are in the past.

860
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,119
I think it was an impulse

861
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,480
between her and Zhao Jin

862
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,199
. As long as she can promise

863
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:54,760
not to see each other again. If he

864
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,800
doesn't date him,

865
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:56,800
I can pretend that this

866
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,840
has never happened.

867
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,880
I still care

868
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,039
about the relationship between us.

869
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,679
I think now is the time

870
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,079
to think about our future

871
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,280
. Think about the development of your flower shop

872
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,880
, shouldn't everyone look forward? She herself

873
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,760
, her family

874
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,800
, including the flower shop,

875
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,480
I don’t think

876
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,280
Zhao Jin can be of much help.

877
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,599
I think,

878
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,039
promise,

879
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,840
she probably doesn’t want

880
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,719
your so-called help.

881
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,280
She probably needs

882
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,039
someone who loves her.

883
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,199
No one in this world

884
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,280
can compare to her. I love her more.

885
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,440
She should say

886
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:47,000
what she wants in her heart,

887
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:47,659
right

888
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,800
?

889
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,000
So I want you

890
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,480
to talk to her.

891
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:56,159
Now is the time

892
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,039
to think about this issue

893
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,559
. To be honest,

894
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,400
I have been with her for so many years

895
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,960
and chased me. There were quite a few girls

896
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,880
, but I rejected them all.

897
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,239
Because I love her

898
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,960
,

899
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,800
this is the task you arranged for me.

900
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,119
I really may not be able to complete

901
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,199
this package. I can't accept it,

902
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,079
so just take it back.

903
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:23,760
Just treat this package as

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,239
a gift between friends

905
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,480
. Even if you don't do it,

906
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,360
It doesn't matter anything
