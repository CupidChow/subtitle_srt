1
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,959
You don’t have to be in such a hurry

2
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,359
I’m afraid you’ll be cold

3
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,599
This should be the closest place

4
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,159
I won’t talk for too long

5
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,239
Let’s chat here for a little bit

6
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:51,840
That’s it

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
Come in, it’s too cold

8
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,519
Please sit down first

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,360
Thank you< /b>

10
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,599
I knew it earlier

11
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,599
Just send a message

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,319
I also asked you to make a trip

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,479
I actually have something to tell you

14
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,919
I have a boyfriend

15
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,639
I am divorced

16
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,199
You are divorced

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Then

18
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,080
I will live with you Girl

19
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,759
Yes

20
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,479
Are you very curious about me

21
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,840
Is this what you want to tell me

22
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,599
Is this all

23
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,039
No

24
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,840
I actually want to say

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,360
I am very curious

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,439
What kind of girl is Xu Nuo?

27
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,199
Actually, I am the first

28
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,599
After seeing you here  times

29
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,319
 I will think of you often

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,919
Of course I have also thought

31
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,360
about you 

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,199
There is already someone

33
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,919
beside me  But I still can’t control it

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,639
I will often think of you

35
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,719
Maybe I made you misunderstand 

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
I apologize to you

37
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,800
Why do you apologize

38
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,719
Although the time is short

39
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,680
But I am very happy

40
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,959
If I said this

41
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,079
If it makes you uncomfortable

42
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,439
Just pretend I didn’t say it

43
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,639
No

44
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,279
Let’s be friends< /b>

45
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
I have no confidence

46
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,759
I can get along with you naturally

47
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,639
Brother

48
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,600
Why are you here

49
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,839
 He's asleep

50
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,199
I can't contact him

51
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,680
Drinking too much again

52
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,439
What are you doing here

53
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing here

54
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,699
Let go

55
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,639
You can't take it

56
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,339
Let go

57
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,079
What are you doing

58
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,920
Let go and let go

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,600
Let me go

60
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:26,339


61
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,279
Let go Leave quickly

62
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,199
Just leave like your mother

63
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,120
I heard you didn’t leave 

64
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,639
Stop arguing

65
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,160
Drink

66
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,800
Brother

67
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,680
Wait a moment

68
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,519
Brother, don’t be angry

69
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,000
He hasn’t drank for a long time

70
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,720
He only drank because of the typhoon two days ago

71
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,079
All the shrimps he raised were destroyed

72
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,480
He drank< /b>

73
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,560
Brother

74
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,399
Brother

75
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,120
Forward it to him

76
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
What about our activities

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Mainly on the second floor b>

78
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,720
So the space here

79
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,000
You can use it as you like

80
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,240
The space here is really good

81
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,040
It’s quite big

82
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Then let’s go to the first floor and take a look

83
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,660
Okay

84
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,639
These are some basic models

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
These are all new models this year

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
A variety of styles are available

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,279
And we can also do

88
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,079
Private customization

89
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,959
It’s so beautiful

90
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,000
Isn’t this right now? 

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,959
Is it Valentine’s Day yet?

92
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,879
So what?

93
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
I want to combine these wedding dresses

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,839
For a ten-year date event< /b>

95
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,879
When the time comes

96
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,839
I will invite some

97
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
couples who have been in love for ten years

98
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,959
to propose collectively here

99
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,120
This is perfect for our family's commitment

100
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,639
Group proposal

101
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,800
This is difficult to achieve

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
What to do if something goes wrong

103
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,560
 What I mean is

104
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,079
Do you really think we are suitable?

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,279
I have seen your wedding work

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,800
It is very close to what I want

107
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,120
But after all

108
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,680
Proposing is not the same as getting married

109
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,319
I have to go back and think about it again

110
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,920
You see, the king always trusts us so much

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
What to think about when you go back

112
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,680
Just treat it like a real wedding

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Just do the same

114
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,399
Right, Mr. Wang

115
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,279
 Imagine

116
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,399
if Peng Yuan proposed

117
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,519
to you in front of many people

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,679
Would you be moved

119
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,399
 Crying out

120
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,960
I never thought about it

121
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,639
Then let’s go find him now

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,480
Let you feel it in person

123
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,240
I’m not in a hurry Why are you anxious

124
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
I must be anxious

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,159
I am anxious for you

126
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:49,899
You

127
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,480
What are you doing?

128
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,559
You just take this opportunity

129
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,279
Tell him clearly

130
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,360
What to say 

131
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,000
What's the matter with you

132
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,240
Where is he?

133
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,840
It's snowing

134
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,200
Really

135
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,279
Today When I went out in the morning

136
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
it was still sunny

137
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,120
But this should be

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,679
the last snow

139
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,639
If you don’t go< /b>

140
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,759
I just made an appointment

141
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,879
I can’t waste it

142
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,799
The last snow

143
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,240
Let’s go

144
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,840
Change your words so quickly

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,279
Beautiful

146
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,200
Good

147
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,179
Locked

148
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Good

149
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,480
Good

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,799
Just wait for him here

151
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,200
It’s probably over soon

152
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,519
Come in and have a look

153
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,720
I just happened to have a look inside< /b>

154
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,559
Are there any handsome guys?

155
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,299
Let’s go

156
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
Pretty and good

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,799
Okay

158
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,519
Lock, lock, lock

159
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,600
I didn't see it before

160
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,159
Your boyfriend is a bit reckless

161
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,360
Where did you see it?

162
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,879
Look at his performance on the court< /b>

163
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,159
Has he always been like this

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,279
He has always been like this

165
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,200
It’s just that

166
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,279
he doesn’t usually show it

167
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,440
 >Okay

168
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,639
It’s okay, wait and see

169
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,039
I think Peng Yuan

170
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,039
is not injured

171
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,799
Are you okay

172
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,080
< b>I haven’t practiced for a long time

173
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,080
I couldn’t control my strength just

174
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,519
now At this stage

175
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,399
You can’t use foot locks

176
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,480
It’s easy Hurt someone

177
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,600
Sorry, sorry

178
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,639
Just now I just thought about winning

179
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,840
Not bad

180
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,639
You won’t treat Peng Yuan b>

181
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,440
Are you fascinated

182
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,120
Is there something wrong with you

183
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,879
The opponent I mentioned

184
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,240
I have been observing him

185
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,600
< b>What do you think of him

186
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,460
I don’t know

187
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,440
Didn’t pay attention

188
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,720
Can you continue?

189
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,679
You must continue if you want to win Ah

190
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,799
I was thinking about me for a while

191
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,120
Should I go and strike up a conversation with him

192
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,360
I’m warning you

193
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,440
Don’t cause trouble< /b>

194
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,000
What happened to me

195
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,240
Why are you reacting so loudly

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360

What kind of person do you want to marry 

455
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,460
 You can accept it

456
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,359
It’s probably because of

457
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,200
work Things

458
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,319

465
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,039

it has something to do with her raising a cat< /b>

471
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,000
The doctor said it

472
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,640
It has nothing to do with the cat

473
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,660

Same old

484
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,839
A little dizzy

485
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,200
Don’t Sighed

486
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,920
I'm used to it

487
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,279
I still can't live without someone around me

488
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,400
I can wake up

489
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,440
without anyone  >

490
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,599
Just wake up later

491
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,799
Otherwise

492
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,680
Follow me

493
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,480
Go to the pet hospital to work

494
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:51,819
No

495
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,200
Then I have no more freedom

496
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,119
I want freedom if I want it

497
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,920
Be free

498
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,079
The patient had been suffering from

499
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,200
aplastic anemia

500
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,720
for so many years

501
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,839
it has always been mild Symptoms

502
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:05,839
I am also taking medicine

503
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,960
Nothing has happened

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,519
Big problems

505
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,279
It is recommended to transfer to the hematology department

506
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,319
< b>Do special examinations

507
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,240
to see if there is

508
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:14,359
the risk of turning from mild to severe disease

509
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,680
It’s so serious

510
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,519
From the patient’s< /b>

511
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,680
Looking at the examination results

512
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,319
The patient’s blood picture performance

513
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,160
is not very satisfactory

514
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,400
What to do next

515
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,640
 A more detailed inspection

516
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,039
to see if it is confirmed to be a severe aneurysm

517
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,759
I think this display cabinet

518
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,599
can be

519
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,480
given to someone soon  Carry it away

520
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,319
Everything can be cleared away

521
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:40,960
Okay

522
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
I will find someone to do it in a while

523
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,720
I think this is the case

524
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,380
No need

525
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:43,880
Okay

526
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,380
You can find someone later

527
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,119
Let’s make arrangements

528
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:45,819
Okay

529
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,599

I am not going to use roses

This is a large-scale proposal scene b>

533
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,480
You don’t use roses

534
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,279
What do you use?

535
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:02,539
Look

536
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,160
I want them all to be covered with cherry blossoms

537
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,359
 Why are the cherry blossoms

538
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,400
designed to be at night

539
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,200
Yes, we need a snow machine

540
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:12,200
Please remember it for me

541
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,200
That night It's snowing

What excitement did you feel

545
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,160
Just imagine it

546
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,119
On a snowy night

547
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
Street full of cherry blossoms

548
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,640
Every girl

549
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,920
Waiting for her beloved to arrive

550
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,039
< b>It’s romantic when you think about it, right?

551
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,940
Romantic

552
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,319
Exceptionally romantic

553
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,680

I just

557
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,279
don’t think about it very much lately

558
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,839
I don’t think about it much lately 

559
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,079
I don’t know who

560
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,200
was worried about this some time ago 

561
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,519
Yu An has been stressing to me recently

562
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,559
He is Work overtime

563
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,039
Actually, I know

564
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,799
He said that

565
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,519
because he was afraid that I would think too much

566
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,799
 And I also know

567
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,039
What is he hesitating about?

568
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,000
What do you mean?

569
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,000
You don’t believe him?

570
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
The two have been together for a long time

571
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,920
< b>They will sense each other

572
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:12,599

00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:18,039
it is just a good opportunity to take this opportunity

575
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,200

00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,720
That time you and Peng Yuan were in the karaoke bar

583
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,720
The two of you b>

584
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,839
That state

585
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,599
Is zero communication okay?

586
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,180
Do I have it?

587
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,000
You have it

588
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,920
You have been distracted< /b>

589
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,400
I've been there to add to the atmosphere

590
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,079
I'm exhausted, okay?

591
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Where can I find it?

592
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,380
Dad

593
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
 Are you

594
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,000
feeling a little anxious today

595
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,480
I told you

596
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,799
I will take care of this matter

597
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Yes Lao Lin asked

598
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,599
to get to know

599
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,839
his daughter's partner

600
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,200
It's not too much

601
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:30,960
This is like

602
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,039
It’s like I’m trying to figure something out for her

603
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,359
I told you

604
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,359
Marriage is not just playing house

605
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,000
It needs to be carefully considered

606
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:40,960
 Then you can't

607
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,160
be with someone who you don't like

608
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,480
without any emotion at all

609
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,599
Emotions can also

610
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
be cultivated slowly  Well

611
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,480
Have you and your mother

612
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,519
developed emotions over the years 

613
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,839
 If there is no emotion

614
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,079
Your mother and I< /b>

615
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,000
It’s impossible to live for so many years

616
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,759
You two have really developed feelings

617
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,920
Then why

618
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,200
does mom have to divorce you  b>

619
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,799
Don't talk to me about your mother

620
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,839
Last night

621
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,359
You and Shanshan should be together

622
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,880
We work overtime together

623
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,200
Then what?

624
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:17,920
No then

625
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,319
After so many years

626
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,839
You haven’t made a promise

627
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,960
To get married< /b>

628
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,480
You should think about it

629
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,279
Why

630
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,400
To be honest, I don’t know either

631
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,900
Why

632
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,559
No Know why

633
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,160
Actually, you know it better than anyone else

634
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,000
I only know one thing

635
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,680
I can’t live without my promise

636
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,079
Are you sure you want to go? 

637
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:51,920
That bridal shop?

638
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,640
I thought you were just

639
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,519
in front of your father

640
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,359
just pretending

641
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,279
< b>What did you say

642
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,240
It’s nothing

643
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,880
I’d better take you home

644
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,440
The bridal shop is right in front

645
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,079
Not so good Right

646
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,319
You are overthinking

647
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
I am going to pick out bridesmaid dresses

648
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,440
My best friend is getting married

649
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,119
Tonight then

650
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,200
< b>My mom’s birthday

651
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,079
Are you sure you want to go

652
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,880
What are you worried about

653
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,559
Nothing

654
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,799
Nothing

655
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,920
< b>The fever hasn’t gone down yet

656
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,559
It wasn’t like this before

657
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,279
It didn’t last this long before

658
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,119
I’m fine

659
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,359
Don’t worry

660
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,440
Get some more sleep

661
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
I really want to see you

662
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
How you look in a wedding dress

663
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,440
I also wanted to see you before >

664
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,400
But think about it now

665
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,119
Wearing a wedding dress is too tiring

666
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,000
Maybe

667
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,680
your feelings are not accurate

668
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,279
You are overthinking

669
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:42,960
I hope so

670
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,519
I don’t think Peng Yuan is the right one

671
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,480
Peng Yuan

672
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,440
Shi Ran b>

For advice

684
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,720
What a coincidence

685
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,359
I didn’t expect him to be here

686
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,319
I can still meet you

687
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,920
I have something to do

688
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,039

You feel like this

It seems that I have done something wrong

695
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,079
Since I got in your car

696
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,720
It means I didn’t think too much

697
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,880
Really didn’t think too much

698
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,400
You obviously care >

699
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,720
But pretending not to care

700
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
You have done this more than once recently

701
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,079
You care very much, right?

00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,400

Behind your career b>

780
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,239
It’s also because of her efforts and understanding

781
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,599
Aunt Lu

782
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,639
I didn’t do anything either

783
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,119
Just listen to your mother

784
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,559
Let’s not just sit around

785
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,880
It’s time to eat and drink

786
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,559
Old Lin, let’s have another drink

787
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,239
Come on, come on

788
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760

Don’t be angry

793
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,460
Guobin 

794
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,519
You embarrassed me today

795
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,199
Old Lin

796
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,360
What happened today

797
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:37,400
I really don’t know

798
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:38,480
It’s my fault

799
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,800
I really didn’t ask her to come

800
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
I believe you will make

801
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,039
the right choice

802
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,519

Don’t think about it too long

806
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:57,579
I understand

807
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,360
I have many things to do 

808
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,559
Thinking too much

809
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,679
It makes it difficult to make a decision

810
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Sometimes

811
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,599
Force the other party

812
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
You can see the results

813
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,199
Auntie is worried about you two

814
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,119

Aunt Lu, my grandma fell down< /b>

821
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,039
My mother doesn’t know what to do

822
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:29,760
I’m going back first

823
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,599
Then go and call

824
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:32,320
Ask Yuan to take grandma to the hospital Where

Go and see them off

827
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,159
Go quickly

828
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,679
Why did he get in the car?

829
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,639
Aunt Lu

830
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:48,579
He

831
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,820
What's wrong

832
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,760
Ask Yu An to take grandma to the hospital

833
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,400
Grandma fell

834
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,320
Yu An has other things to do

835
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,559
Don’t call him

836
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,760

Does it hurt?

841
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,079
Can you still hold it in?

842
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:24,880
Gently Yes

843
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,059
Mom

844
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,840
You can’t do this

845
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,039
I’ll go get a stretcher

846
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,360
Who are you talking about?

847
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,199
Why did you park your car here?

848
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,420
Nurse

849
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,599

00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,639
Don’t bump her

856
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,840
Right Side 678

857
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,239
Three ribs are fractured

858
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,559
And there is dislocation between the broken ends

859
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,559
Does the doctor

860
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,199
need to do surgery< /b>

861
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,800
This depends on

862
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,960
her physical condition

863
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,239
It is better to arrange hospitalization first

864
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,420

She is always so stubborn in everything she does

874
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,719
She has to wipe the floor even though she is not allowed to do it< /b>

875
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,320
You see, I ended up in the hospital

876
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:39,280
You said Xu was so busy with work

877
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,679
I still have a shop

878
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,280
Who did you think would come? Take care of her

879
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll take care of grandma

880
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,840
I'll go see her

881
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,880
If she wants to ask you

882
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,679
Just say it's not serious< /b>

883
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,920

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,679
Thank you for your hard work

887
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,480
As a family Don’t talk about the two families

888
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,239
I feel like

889
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,760
My mother and I

890
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:17,719
have been dragging down the promise

891
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,599
My mother has been hospitalized< /b>

892
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,719
The problems at home are exposed

893
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:24,440
Women

894
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:26,800
Not having a complete home

895
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,119
It’s really a scary thing

896
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,840
But I think

897
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,039
Promise her to be very independent

898
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,360
She does not feel that

899
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,719
she lacks anything

900
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,880
It is precisely because of her This

901
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,159
That's why I feel sad

902
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,579
Actually

903
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,920
I just hope

904
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,480
she can have a happy family

905
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,000
