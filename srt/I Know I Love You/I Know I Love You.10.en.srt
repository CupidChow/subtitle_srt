<b>Even if he doesn’t know</b>

668
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,960
<b>he should be suspicious</b>

669
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,680
<b>Then then What do you know about him</b>

670
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,799
<b>What do you think he would do</b>

671
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,200

<b>It is something that can be accomplished overnight</b>

675
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,399
<b>This will definitely take several rounds of entanglement</b>

676
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,200

<b>Likes to fight with people all the time</b>

681
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,240

686
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,119
