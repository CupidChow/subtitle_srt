1
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,680
Stop wandering. I saw it earlier.

2
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,079
What

3
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,120
do you want to say?

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,519
I didn’t expect that your crying

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,680
would be quite useful

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
. You had planned

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
it. What was I planning? I felt

8
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,518
really uncomfortable

9
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,959
at that time.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
I really wanted to cry.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
When are you going to

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,319
get the certificate and hold the wedding?

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Then I still have to think about

14
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,519
the ring.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,360
You

16
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,079
have already accepted the ring. What else are you thinking about? Even though I have accepted the ring,

17
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,879
I am not ready yet . I

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,199
haven’t thought about it yet.

19
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,960
What else do you need to prepare?

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,879
Don’t you? Is it the same thing

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,879
to accept someone else’s ring

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,439
? Isn’t it the same thing? It

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,919
’s not the same thing.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
I’m telling you

25
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,159
, don’t bully people all the time. Xu

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,719
Yang, the rabbit bites when he’s anxious

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,719
. Why am I bullying him

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,000
? I’m helping him grow.

29
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:35,959
Okay,

30
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,159
these men

31
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,359
generally have low emotional intelligence.

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,799
Xu Yang’s emotional intelligence is a little lower

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,479
than that of ordinary boys.

34
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,560
So what do you think

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Zhao Jin

36
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,239
and Peng Yuan

37
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
have to talk about

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,039
when they meet ? What time is it? They

39
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,519
haven’t come back yet.

40
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,799
What should we do if

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,199
people really fight

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,479
? Two grown men

43
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,319
fought over a promise to our family.

44
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,399
Do you know what I think

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,599
is the funniest thing

46
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,879
now? Now everyone

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,479
will think that Peng Yuan

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,280
is a victim

49
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,240
, feel pity for him,

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,080
and feel that you hurt him

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
and you abandoned him. He

52
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,918
is right.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,319
Now in everyone's eyes,

54
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,840
I am a bad woman.

55
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,719
Although

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Peng Yuan

57
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,080
is pursuing someone else

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,918
, I have to say that

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,560
the one he likes in his heart

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,439
has always been you.

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
It doesn't matter anymore

62
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,000
. Did you hear the sound of a car downstairs

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,840
? Come

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,240
back

65
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,740
slowly.

66
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,560
Come back.

67
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,719
You said I'll go and

68
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,560
tell him in a while.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,919
Don't say anything. Just

70
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,840
apologize

71
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,918
and say I'm sorry. Is it okay for

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,319
me to apologize to him?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,240
You 'll die if you say sorry.

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,840
You don't know that

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:07,918
we are together.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,719
I've told him I

77
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,079
'm sorry countless times since then

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,919
. Why?

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,860
Isn't it because

80
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,800
you keep getting into trouble?

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,439
Dr. Zhao is just too

82
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,918
generous to care about you.

83
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,040
Just leave quickly.

84
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,399
Why are you

85
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,279
hanging here? I'm leaving

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,879
. Please keep the door open

87
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,720
for a while. Once

88
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,959
If he doesn't take me in,

89
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
I have to come back again.

90
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,399
Is this your refuge?

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,759
I'm leaving

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,360
. I'm taking a shower

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,439
. Are you naked

94
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,360
? What are you thinking about? You

95
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,879
've passed. Ten seconds later.

96
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Come in again.

97
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,579
Promise

98
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,959
one or two . Three four five six seven eight ninety

99
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:17,519
has been unlocked and

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,160
is here

101
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,759
. My sister is sleeping

102
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,879
. If you are not angry,

103
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:44,959
I will let go of

104
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,079
you. If you are angry,

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,480
I will keep holding you like this .

106
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,160
You must first tell

107
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
me what mistake you made

108
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
, but you did not tell you.

109
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,159
I went to see Peng Yuan and

110
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,959
I didn’t tell you

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
that I went to see Peng Yuan.

112
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
You see,

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,879
I’m not the only one who made a mistake.

114
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,519
I didn’t mean to hide it

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,040
from you. I just came to apologize to you.

116
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,560
What did you drink?

117
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,240
I drank a little at Shi Ran’s house

118
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,639
. Stop drinking and refill

119
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:32,879
yours.

120
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,060
I'll

121
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,120
drive you home in a minute .

122
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,279
I'm going to spend the night here.

123
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,279
Why

124
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,639
can't it be done?

125
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,879
It's not that

126
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,199
it can't be done. What's

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,000
the point

128
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,360
? I'm afraid

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,279
you'll faint

130
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,160
if I really have to spend the night here.

131
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
I'll go. Didn't you say you wanted to apologize

132
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,120
when you

133
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,199
slept at Shi Ran's house

134
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
? Go on, I

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
'm sorry. Actually, I should

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,279
have said this at the beginning , but I kept changing the subject

137
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,920
. I accepted Peng Yuan's ring

138
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,899
. I know

139
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,639
it sounds like I'm making excuses,

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,300
but I was

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,720
There is really no other choice

142
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,519
. Let me make it clearer.

143
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,120
I

144
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,040
don’t think I have the right

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,519
to throw away the ring because he was

146
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,079
also a victim in

147
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
that relationship.

148
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,160
Okay.

149
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,439
I understand that

150
00:07:59,399 --> 00:07:59,920
you are probably quite upset

151
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,160
about this matter.

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,439
That’s right. What I

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,360
learned from you:

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,839
Before I met you,

155
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,800
I didn’t have such a high consciousness

156
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,639
. Actually, I

157
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,120
was unhappy before that

158
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,240
you didn’t tell me

159
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,279
about your ex-wife .

160
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,480
I wasn’t happy that

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,839
you went to meet Shi Shi in private

162
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,959
and you still liked him

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
, etc. etc. Who do you

164
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,480
like now?

165
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,240
Shitou,

166
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,920
I just thought that

167
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,079
the child was pitiful,

168
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
okay?

169
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Anyway,

170
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,759
when

171
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,558
I met Shitou with you later,

172
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,600
I realized that

173
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,279
my idea was really stupid.

174
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,759
If people only care about

175
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,000
their own life and death,

176
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,039
how selfish would they be

177
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,399
? It's so bad.

178
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,279
If I hadn't met you,

179
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,159
I

180
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
would never realize it in my life.

181
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,639
From now on

182
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:53,960
, I will slowly become

183
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
a person like you.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,879
I think your

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
eyes are full of grievances now.

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,759
It's as if

187
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,080
I forced you to say

188
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
these words

189
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,559
, right?

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Look at the tears

191
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,960
in your eyes now. You

192
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
are so wronged.

193
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,399
What are you thinking about?

194
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,600
Then Shi Ran

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,960
cried a lot

196
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,799
in front of Xu Yang.

197
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,039
Xu Yang

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,519
bought her a ring the next day,

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,159
and Shi Ran even showed it off to me. Well,

200
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
Xu Yang proposed.

201
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,759
Is this the point?

202
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,799
Apologize, apologize

203
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,460
, don’t change the subject, say your

204
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,559
apology properly.

205
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,279
Stingy

206
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,480
, stingy, stingy, why am I stingy? Why am I

207
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,039
stingy,

208
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,519
I allowed you to

209
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,919
spend the night

210
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,480
at my house

211
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,600
today.

212
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,480
Why am

213
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,919
I being stingy? Keep your voice down,

214
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,080
you are stingy

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,519
.

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
Is this also a magical moment?

217
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,519
Yes, it

218
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:14,879
’s so beautiful.

219
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,120
It scared me

220
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,519
. Why are you sleeping here

221
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,679
? Am I snoring in my sleep

222
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,319
? Are you still snoring?

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh my god, do

224
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,600
you know

225
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,399
how many times you kicked me out of

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,759
bed last night?

227
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,679
That’s because of your bed. It's too small.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,559
I'll tell you

229
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,480
if you change it to a bigger one next time.

230
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:15,759
I will never allow

231
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,120
you to sleep in my house

232
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,799
from now on. Then

233
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
if I don’t want to go home, I

234
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,559
can only come to sleep at your place.

235
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:24,559
It’s impossible

236
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,720
. I will never compromise.

237
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,159
So

238
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,879
how about this? I can’t afford it. I didn’t wake up.

239
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,000
You can string

240
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,439
it in. Chuan Chuan

241
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,259
, like this

242
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:47,840
, you stay like this.

243
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,919
Hold me tightly and

244
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,480
we won’t fall.

245
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,240
I

246
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,159
fell ,

247
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,960
my butt.

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,639
Get up. Where

249
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,799
is your sister?

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,399
Yes,

251
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,639
my sister is gone

252
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,279
and she pressed on my leg.

253
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
Go away and

254
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,559
promise.

255
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,440
I promised

256
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,720
to raise a cat in

257
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,639
the cat litter box

258
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
early in the morning.

259
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm back.

260
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,279
What's wrong?

261
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,879
I went to Zhao Jin's house to sleep.

262
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,799
Are you unhappy ?

263
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,659
Peng Yu'an just

264
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,440
called me

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and said he wanted to meet me

266
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,840
. I said I wasn't feeling well and

267
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,600
he said I I won’t

268
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,879
bother you for too long.

269
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,000
I really don’t understand

270
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,919
why this person is so persistent

271
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,399
.

272
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,000
I’m sorry. Let me handle this matter.

273
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,120
How do you handle it?

274
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,799
Why don’t you go down

275
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,639
to greet him for me?

276
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,960
By the way, tell him who

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,519
you got from last night.

278
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,600
The night spent at home

279
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,960
is my own business and it has

280
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
nothing to do with him.

281
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,159
Why should I tell him?

282
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,079
What is his thing that

283
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,159
was given to

284
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
him

285
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,600
by a

286
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:19,039
person who he thinks is inferior to him in every way

287
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,679
? I am not an object

288
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,279
. It doesn't come true because he

289
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
loves you too much.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Do you know

291
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,679
what I'm most worried about now?

292
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,639
No matter

293
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,399
what means

294
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,639
Peng Yu'an uses

295
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,639
, even if you're not with him,

296
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,840
you can't be with Zhao Jin.

297
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,240
This is his purpose.

298
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,000
He doesn't do it,

299
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,399
why doesn't he do it? Think about it,

300
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,440
how many people would recognize it

301
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,120
if you and Zhao Jin

302
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
were together

303
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,440
? Did Zhao Jin commit a crime

304
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,080
? Did I commit a crime

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,879
? No, what you said is such an exaggeration.

306
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,720
I didn't mean it like that.

307
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,799
I mean, look.

308
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,840
Zhao Jin is

309
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,360
the talk of others, right? You did give up a

310
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,480
marriage partner that

311
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,399
everyone thinks is

312
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,100
a good marriage

313
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,840
for him,

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,759
right?

315
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,720
Anyway, I have thought about it

316
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:11,519
, no matter what others say,

317
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,500
I will not regret

318
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,880
being with Zhao Jin

319
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,799
.

320
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,960
Shi Ran will not go to see you

321
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:33,720
and I will

322
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,440
make it clear

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,279
to my family

324
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
about my matters

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,119
. Do you think your parents

326
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,279
will accept Zhao Jin?

327
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,000
You don’t have to worry about it. You can follow

328
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:41,819
me, my parents

329
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
and my friends one by one. The purpose of meeting

330
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,359
is to force me

331
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,639
to treat you. I have achieved my goal,

332
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,420
so I

333
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,640
would rather be honest now

334
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:49,720
. No matter what the outcome

335
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,519
is, it is better than being driven crazy by you.

336
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,519
Promise,

337
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,399
my patience has its limit.

338
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
If you are willing to look back now,

339
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,039
I will help

340
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:02,319
you cover up

341
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
with your parents. Can you

342
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,279
accept this fact

343
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
like a man ? We have broken up.

344
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,039
The person who refuses to face the reality is

345
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
the person you have been obsessed with,

346
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,039
and it is you

347
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,279
. If you continue like this,

348
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:12,980
you will regret it.

349
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:13,639
You know,

350
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,000
okay , so let's go

351
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,519
according to our own ideas

352
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,839
now. Do what

353
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,639
you want to do.

354
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,799
Don't

355
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,160
be angry. I'm not angry.

356
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,680
I've unlocked the door

357
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,599
and

358
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,680
come back. What's wrong? I had a fight with Shi Ran.

359
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,599
She didn't have anything to eat there,

360
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,799
so I came back.

361
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,759
What did I give up?

362
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,359
What did I give up?

363
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,039
I gave up. I said before that

364
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,000
I would slowly turn into you. I

365
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,960
originally thought about thinking

366
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,759
about

367
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,679
others

368
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,839
when I do anything in the future

369
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:17,839
, but I later found

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
that it was not suitable for me at all

371
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,079
. What kind of stimulation did I get?

372
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,519
I was offended

373
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,640
because of you and

374
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,119
I can’t

375
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,119
lose my temper now.

376
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,879
Why should I keep doing this? Are

377
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,079
we committing a capital crime by holding on?

378
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,000
No,

379
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,000
I have to tell

380
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,400
everything. Otherwise

381
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,519
, how long will we be forced

382
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,759
? Who forced you

383
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,039
? Peng Yuan,

384
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
if you tell me everything

385
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,279
, will anything change?

386
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,039
No

387
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,599
, but I still want to tell

388
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:56,859
it. What you said

389
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,279
will only make it more difficult for you

390
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,519
to feed Mom.

391
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,000
Why aren't you at home?

392
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,160
I called you and didn't answer the call.

393
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,480
I

394
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,079
slept at Shi Ran's house last night.

395
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,200
You two drank

396
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,319
and didn't

397
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:25,680
talk about work

398
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,359
. Who is laughing?

399
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,279
You are not with that

400
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
man . I don't have

401
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,839
you at home.

402
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:34,960
Come over quickly.

403
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm in front of your store.

404
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,680
You locked the door.

405
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,759
I have something to say to you.

406
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,839
Hurry

407
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,279
up.

408
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:40,879
Okay, I understand.

409
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,119
Hang up. I'm wronged. I'm wronged.

410
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,880
Why

411
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,359
is there no one here?

412
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,279
Didn't I say it was ten o'clock? Have you just opened the door? Yes,

413
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,319
I forgot

414
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,079
. You don’t need to pour it. I’m not thirsty.

415
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,599
What else can you

416
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
do to me at home ?

417
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,039
How long have you been home ?

418
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,359
Even if you don’t care about my life or death,

419
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,079
your grandma must take a look.

420
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,839
I understand.

421
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:19,519
That’s it.

422
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,079
One more thing ,

423
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,240
I want to remarry your father

424
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,640
and I want to tell you. If

425
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,839
you think about it,

426
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,839
won’t you still be like that?

427
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,519
Didn’t you say that he is

428
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,519
still gambling outside

429
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
? No, he doesn’t gamble now

430
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,079
. He just plays

431
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,440
without winning or losing . What else can

432
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,000
he do about the debt he owed before?

433
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,200
Just

434
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,960
pay

435
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,839
it back slowly.

436
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,039
If you think about it,

437
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,039
I will support you.

438
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,599
Even if I don't agree,

439
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:02,559
I will support you.

440
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,039
By the way,

441
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,200
Yu An came to us.

442
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,960
What did he say? He didn't say anything

443
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
. He did

444
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,319
n't say anything

445
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:16,519
. Why

446
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,319
don't you take that man back

447
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,240
to meet us some other time?

448
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,599
Let's have a dinner date.

449
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,799
You have to let me and your father

450
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,480
meet him.

451
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,079
Did Peng Yuan tell you

452
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,960
something about him

453
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,759
? He didn't say anything.

454
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,319
But it’s you.

455
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,519
You haven’t told us the truth.

456
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,359
Is there something wrong with him?

457
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,759
There’s nothing wrong with him

458
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,700
. It

459
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,359
’s just

460
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:49,879
that he’s not

461
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:52,799
the kind of son-

462
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,839
in-law you imagined.

463
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,680
What do you mean?

464
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,879
He has an average income and comes from an ordinary

465
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,680
family. His

466
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,160
father is a fisherman

467
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,440
and his mother

468
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,660
was a long time ago.

469
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,119
He is no longer with them.

470
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,119
He has a sick sister

471
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,519
. What else

472
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,839
can

473
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,799
he say? You

474
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,559
, he has been divorced.

475
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,240
He has been divorced.

476
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,000
What do you think

477
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,119
? Each one of them is enough for you.

478
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:32,960
Every one of them is

479
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,079
untouchable in a blind date.

480
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Do you understand the red line

481
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,920
? Do you really want to

482
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:36,919
give up Yu An

483
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:37,720
for such a man

484
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,720
? He is such a man.

485
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,839
He is a very good person.

486
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,160
I like him.

487
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,119
He is the person I like

488
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,200
. The person I like

489
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,079
cannot live by just liking

490
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,240
me and him. After we were together,

491
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,439
I became a better person

492
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,160
and I think life is more interesting.

493
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,000
Every day is not just

494
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
for living,

495
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,480
Mom

496
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,119
, I can't live without him

497
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:11,960
.

498
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,559
You are already thirty years old this year.

499
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,740
This may be your

500
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
last chance to make a choice.

501
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
If you really go with that Zhao After Jin

502
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
gets married,

503
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,039
no matter what problems arise

504
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,440
or difficulties

505
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,839
you encounter, there is no turning back.

506
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,920
You can only continue on with him.

507
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,799
Have you ever thought that

508
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,279
the older this woman is,

509
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,839
the fewer opportunities she will have in the final choice?

510
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,480
Maybe

511
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,839
he might really be like you said. He

512
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,920
is a good person

513
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,799
, but we can't

514
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,799
marry him just

515
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,599
because he is a good person.

516
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,640
Mom hopes that you can find someone

517
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,680
who can support you

518
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,319
in all aspects.

519
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,279
After you get married

520
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,279
for a long time,

521
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,519
the relationship

522
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,319
will fade away . That's good,

523
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,759
but at least you

524
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,119
won't have any problems in life.

525
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,559
No matter how much you like him now, you can't support your

526
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,599
daughter for the rest of your life just

527
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,839
by relying on this relationship

528
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,879
. You are

529
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,240
still young now. You

530
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,039
can't just think about the present

531
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,919
. Do we have to think about it in the future?

532
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,519
Thinking in the long run,

533
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,399
at least

534
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,759
when you reach my age,

535
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,399
your life

536
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,440
will be

537
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,400
better than mine.

538
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,000
I can't control that much.

539
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,240
I don't want

540
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,759
to give up on me for those things

541
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,440
that no one can say.

542
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,559
Now

543
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,680
I will take Zhao Jin

544
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,519
with me. I'll take care of

545
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,639
the Peng Yu'an side you met,

546
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,039
Aunt

547
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:35,539
Shi Ran,

548
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,519
you're leaving.

549
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,480
What's

550
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,200
wrong? It's

551
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,240
okay.

552
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,240
You're busy with your work.

553
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,759
Okay, good morning. Sister Ranran,

554
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,480
what

555
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:50,960
's going on with Huahua

556
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,839
? I don't know

557
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,199
what's going on.

558
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,680
We had a quarrel.

559
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,480
It's okay.

560
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,519
Go get busy. Well,

561
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
why are you here?

562
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:50,920
I shed tears

563
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,079
just talking to my mother.

564
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,079
You ran out during working hours.

565
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,119
Sister Hong knew it was time to scold you.

566
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,440
In fact, it’s good

567
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
to cry occasionally

568
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,960
. I can still see you during working hours.

569
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,759
Now you are like this.

570
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,359
What should

571
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,319
I do in the future? I’m not crying because I’m being scolded.

572
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,599
I’m just inexplicable.

573
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,440
Isn’t it okay for me to

574
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,440
cry? Of course

575
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,839
it’s okay. But you’d better not

576
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,200
cry when I’m not around in the future

577
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
. That way I’ll feel sorry

578
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,039
for you. Aren’t you here now

579
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,039
? Then you can cry

580
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,200
someday. Come back with me when you have time

581
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,000
to meet

582
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
my mother and the others,

583
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,119
okay

584
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,240
Zhao Jin.

585
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,559
If one day

586
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,599
you don’t like me,

587
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
you must tell me

588
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,000
what to say.

589
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:02,839
If one day

590
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,539
I don’t like you,

591
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,119
I will definitely tell you

592
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,240
why I said that.

593
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,639
I hope. Two people

594
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,039
are together because they

595
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
have a good relationship

596
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,480
, not because they are used to each other. They are

597
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,240
living together reluctantly.

598
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,039
I am

599
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,079
with you because I like you

600
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,439
. Me too.

601
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,480
It seems that I really have to

602
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,119
go back to work.

603
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,799
Stay for another minute.

604
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,759
You didn't see it.

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,960
She spoke to me

606
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,000
as if she had already thought

607
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,240
about marrying Zhao Jin.

608
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
No way, absolutely not.

609
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,519
Just for such a veterinarian,

610
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,339
she dumped the nice Yu An.

611
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,359
Did that guy

612
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,099
give

613
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,000
her some ecstasy soup

614
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,079
? Did you? After drinking the ecstasy soup,

615
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,960
you go and tell the girl.

616
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,519
We firmly disagree.

617
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,279
Why don't you tell the girl?

618
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,240
You're a mother.

619
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,240
You have to do something.

620
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,599
You can't watch her acting like this.

621
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,259
You know,

622
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:20,879
then you're a father,

623
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,680
too. You should tell her

624
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,799
what your daughter's temper is like

625
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,839
. You don't know.

626
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,359
I told you, will it work?

627
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:26,759
Can I persuade her?

628
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,039
Also, don't touch

629
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:32,339
Yu An's money

630
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,640
for now. Oh, what? Did you hear me

631
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,519
? Don't touch that money.

632
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,000
It's something else.

633
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,720
We can't touch the money

634
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,039
until we have investigated clearly.

635
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,599
I didn't tell Nuonuo

636
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,079
about Yu An's investment in us.

637
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,039
How could he be so kicky?

638
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
His feet smell bad.

639
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,440
Help me take

640
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:02,920
it and feed it to the cat. Where did it go

641
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
 

642
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:05,960
? I don't know

643
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,559
where it went

644
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,839
when I got home. The cat won't be there. I 'm

645
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,920
looking everywhere and I can't find

646
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,480
it. OK, OK, it shouldn't be.

647
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,200
I 'm going to help you look

648
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,319
for it. What are you doing?

649
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:13,779
You guys eat

650
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,720
first. I have something to do

651
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,039
when I go out .

652
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,359
It's nice to see

653
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,599
, but I always feel like I've changed.

654
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,519
How can I become a different person?

655
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,839
You're so good-looking to begin with , but you didn't know

656
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,160
and didn't know how to put on makeup

657
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,279
before.

658
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,359
So,

659
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,559
if your boyfriend

660
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,240
gets used to seeing you with makeup,

661
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,480
will he not like

662
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,559
your look without makeup

663
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,839
? Do you know that

664
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,759
there are some wealthy wives

665
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,039
? My husband has never seen

666
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,119
them take off their makeup.

667
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,160
They even put it on

668
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:46,480
when they sleep.

669
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,440
How tired are you talking about

670
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,160
? Are n’t

671
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,079
they the people in the

672
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,799
movie every day

673
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,599
? Bai Xiaobai

674
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,079
, have you even forgotten who your brother is?

675
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,240
Where is

676
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,879
Sister Shi Ran

677
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,599
? I don’t know how to remove makeup.

678
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,000
I’ll get you something. Please

679
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,000
wait for me.

680
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,039
This facial cleanser

681
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,299
is good

682
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
. I use it well . I’ll give

683
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,000
you these two

684
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:18,920
. Don’t forget

685
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,000
to pick them

686
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,319
up when you leave.

687
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,919
Thank you, sister

688
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,400
. You ’re welcome.

689
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,039
Didn't you hear anything

690
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,160
in the room yesterday

691
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,960
? You said my brother and Sister Xu Nuo

692
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,599
were sleeping on the sofa.

693
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
Sister Xu Nuo was sleeping in my brother's room.

694
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,119
Is n't that true?

695
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,160
I saw Sister Shi Ran

696
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:41,879
when I got

697
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,039
up this morning

698
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,640
. Are you

699
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,079
special ? I want to live with

700
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,480
brother Xu Yang.

701
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,400
What is going on

702
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:54,240
in your little head

703
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,400
every day ? But I am not in a hurry.

704
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,000
We will have a lifetime

705
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,359
together

706
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,519
after getting married.

707
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,119
So do you think

708
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,920
it will affect me

709
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,119
if I live with my brother

710
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,319
now ?

711
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,359
It's not possible for

712
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,759
the two of them to fall in love, definitely not

713
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:10,919
, and you will

714
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,440
have to live with them in the future.

715
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,000
But if you want to

716
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,799
change your place,

717
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,000
you can come to my place.

718
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,399
I welcome

719
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,640
you here at any time. I'm

720
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,079
so happy.

721
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:28,079
Thank you, Master.

722
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,599
Goodbye,

723
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:31,960
big-faced,

724
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,159
big-faced,

725
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,079
anxious, you

726
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,480
can’t help but wear a coat. My mother

727
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,720
didn’t pay attention to the cat

728
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,559
when she came here today

729
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:40,720
and ran out. It’s okay.

730
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,720
Domestic

731
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,380
cats

732
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,359
usually don’t run too far.

733
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,559
So why don’t you search over there? Let’s search

734
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,839
upstairs

735
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,720
. I've looked for it.

736
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,240
There

737
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,200
should be no

738
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:02,440
claws on the tree. Have they been clipped?

739
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,599
Big face,

740
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,800
big face

741
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:23,880
, big face

742
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:26,238
, big face.

743
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,800
Your sister will be very angry

744
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,840
if I lose her.

745
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm sure

746
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,719
she may never ignore you

747
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,800
again . What should I do? It's

748
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,519
okay

749
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,519
. Just don't tell her yet.

750
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
The operation failed.

751
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,800
Here comes

752
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,440
the big face

753
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,360
.

754
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,440
Brother Yuan,

755
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,480
why are you here?

756
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,039
Dahao,

757
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,599
why are you here?

758
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,679
We are watching football at his house.

759
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Why are you here

760
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,079
? I'm looking for Zhao Jin.

761
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,599
I called him just now and he didn't answer.

762
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,559
Zhao Jin, why did he go to

763
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:58,920
Xuyang

764
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,780
?

765
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,639
Come here,

766
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,360
why did Zhao Jin go to

767
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:04,679
Zhao Jin?

768
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,159
Zhao Jin just called

769
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,199
out.

770
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,320
Zhao Jin called out just now

771
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:10,079
. We don’t know

772
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,880
where he went

773
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,599
. Do you

774
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
want to come in and have something to eat together

775
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,599
?

776
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,400
I have something to do. You guys eat and

777
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,719
walk slowly.

778
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:29,679
Why

779
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,559
did you let him in?

780
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,079
It's

781
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:36,039
so embarrassing.

782
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,199
What should I say? Can't you

783
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,480
see that he

784
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:39,599
didn't come to Zhao Jin

785
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:40,659
at

786
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,760
all

787
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,039
? It's true that he said the promise,

788
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,920
why did you accept his ring?

789
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,239
Peng Yu'an thought

790
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,800
his proposal was successful.

791
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:52,760
Brother

792
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,159
, please stop being funny. Brother,

793
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,320
he knew that the proposal would be rejected,

794
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,119
so he

795
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,400
forced the ring on Promise

796
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,480
. I think he is a bit

797
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,719
stubborn now.

798
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,079
If you put it another way,

799
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:06,480
does it mean that Peng Yuan

800
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,559
has always loved

801
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,239
Brother Xunuo

802
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,159
? If this can be considered love

803
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,880
, then unrequited love

804
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,159
can also be considered love. Do

805
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,559
you understand? You said it as if you

806
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,719
have experience.

807
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,360
You have a good mind at this time. Even

808
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,559
if you take some of

809
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
the cat food

810
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,480
it has been eating before

811
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,320
and put it at the door of your house,

812
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,360
maybe it

813
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,159
will smell the smell and

814
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
go home.

815
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,719
Don't be too sad.

816
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,559
Don't be too sad.

817
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,360
Go back .

818
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,000
Then you should go back early.

819
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,239
Peng Yu'an

820
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,519
, I have already followed You said it before,

821
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,519
do you need me to

822
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,519
explain it to you again?

823
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,860
We are not from

824
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:04,760
the same world.

825
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,440
I am different from

826
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:08,280
you. A relationship of your level

827
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,399
is nothing

828
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,559
to me. You can date her

829
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:11,800
, but you have to wait

830
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,159
until I break up with her.

831
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,880
I am telling you

832
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,118
the best

833
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,280
way to save your face and the most likely way to achieve it.

834
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,559
She should

835
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,760
open the window soon. Do you

836
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,718
think I will be afraid?

837
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,639
Yes, I am afraid

838
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,320
. I am afraid that my girlfriend

839
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,840
will see her ex-boyfriend

840
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,760
bit by bit. 的真实面目

841
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,440
你少在我面前装清高

842
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,880
我不是来找你的

843
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,199
好啊

844
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,320
有本事你就现在

845
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,960
把她从我眼前带走

846
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,199
你想挑战我

847
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,599
在你被尊重之前

848
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,639
你先学会自爱

849
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,000
你小子

850
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,480
你小子找揍吧

851
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,039
Peng Yuan , you can

852
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:01,760
do whatever you

853
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,679
want in the future.

854
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,800
I completely agree with

855
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,000
my family,

856
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:07,320
friends, and

857
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,159
anyone around me.

858
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,239
You can see me at any time.

859
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,239
You can call me at any time and

860
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:14,920
come over to see me at any time. It’s up to

861
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
you . I’ll

862
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,440
accompany you to

863
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,800
do whatever you want.

864
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I don’t want to do anything. In this way

865
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:23,880
, you can torture me

866
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:24,880
according to your ideas,

867
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,239
and I will treat it as

868
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,440
the price for hurting you

869
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,960
until you calm down. Okay,

870
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,840
stop talking and go back first,

871
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,000
but

872
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,840
you can't torture Zhao Jin.

873
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,239
If you make him feel uncomfortable

874
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:41,440
, I promise that

875
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,199
I will do anything. Come out

876
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,559
, no matter who the other party is,

877
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,280
what's

878
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,760
going on? Why are you so crazy in the middle of the night? Your

879
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,199
dad

880
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,199
, why are you down here?

881
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,079
I 'm fine.

882
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,400
Tomorrow I will

883
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,159
buy Xunuo's flower shop,

884
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,000
Zhao Jin's pet shop, and

885
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,559
invest

886
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,079
in a laundry. It's useless.

887
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,159
I don't understand

888
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,000
how you can't keep

889
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,840
even a promise

890
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,119
with your abilities and conditions.

891
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,039
Anyway,

892
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,920
it doesn't matter what means you use

893
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,480
, as long as you can win.

894
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,559
Isn't this what you taught me?

895
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,599
You think

896
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,960
I am using it

897
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,440
? Do you live by unfair means?

898
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,599
I promise you have seen

899
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,199
her and she will not give in easily.

900
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,519
Only you can help me this time.

901
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,038
As long as you can help me win,

902
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,719
no matter what you say,

903
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,239
I will do

904
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,159
whatever you want me to live.

905
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,199
I will live my life the way

906
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,079
you

907
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:45,679
want me to

908
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,039
. Why haven't you fallen asleep yet? Why haven't you fallen asleep

909
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:53,099
since you came over ? I can't sleep.

910
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:53,820
Then I

911
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,719
took out the photo

912
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
and looked at you. How old are you in this picture

913
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,199
? I think you are only five or six.

914
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,279
I was not even born

915
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,519
at that time

916
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,519
. You were cute when you were a child

917
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,920
, but now you are hated by

918
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,519
others. I still think

919
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,360
Sister Xunuo looks a bit like my mother

920
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,038
,

921
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,320
but they both like flowers.
