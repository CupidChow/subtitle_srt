1
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay, keep eating, keep eating. When you

2
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,200
finish, I'll see

3
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
Dr. Zhao.

4
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,480
Sister Hong asked you

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,540
to

6
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,519
come to the beauty room.

7
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,239
Sister, let me help you take

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,680
a look. You see, it's all bruised

9
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,560
here .

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,159
It's all scratched in the back.

11
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,760
It's my two. I always get into fights

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
and I don’t know why, but

13
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,079
I’m still injured today.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
 

15
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,680
Let me ask a doctor to help you. Thank you,

16
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,439
Dr. Zhao.

17
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:09,399
Come here .

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,500
What’s the matter?

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
Two cats got injured in a fight.

20
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:12,840
You see

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,080
here, the back is bleeding all over.

22
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Take it to the surgical clinic

23
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,199
. Thank you

24
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,719
. Thank you. Doctor,

25
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,599
you're welcome.

26
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,719
This is a new one

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,960
. Besides,

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,199
it's still a stray cat,

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
so it 's quite wild

30
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,360
in character.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,039
They always fight when they eat, and the fight

32
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,680
was a bit fierce today.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,240
You need to make the living environment at home

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,960
quieter

35
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,719
and lower the brightness

36
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,360
so that they can Feel safe

37
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,918
and slowly adapt to each other.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
I will open a bottle of pheromones for you

39
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,839
to ease the tension

40
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,679
between them and

41
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,840
adapt to each other faster.

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,780
Good

43
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,079
doctor

44
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,599
, do you think it is possible that they are

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,560
fighting

46
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,560
because of different breeds

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,159
? Divide them into breeds.

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Cats don’t know

49
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,799
what breed they are

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,319
. They still need time

51
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,000
to develop feelings.

52
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,560
It’ll be fine over time.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,159
You should also be more careful

54
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,599
not to pay too much attention to

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,479
the new one

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,759
and make the previous one

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,039
feel left out.

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay. I know, I

59
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,919
'll give it to

60
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,740
you .

61
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,679
Are you okay? What

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,639
are

63
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,840
you doing?

64
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
I was busy just now. I know,

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,199
okay, okay, it

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,199
scared me

67
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,480
to death. I thought something was wrong with you

68
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
. If you don't answer the phone,

69
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,680
I'll be a little nervous.

70
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,240
I know

71
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,000
you might be busy.

72
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,480
But I just want to

73
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
keep calling you

74
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,279
and want to know what you are doing.

75
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,800
Maybe I am too anxious. It's

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,120
okay.

77
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,560
Where are you? It's

78
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,759
at the beach

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
. Then I'll go find you

80
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,959
. You don't need

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,639
to work .

82
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,279
You're not the boss. You

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,639
can't just leave if you want

84
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,360
. You

85
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,480
can't. I 'm so free

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,199
like Boss Xu.

87
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,279
I sent you a message. Can

88
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,000
you take a look at

89
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,480
this? Aren't you too anxious?

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,600
Didn't you say that you would take me

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
to meet your dad

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
? And next,

93
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,399
I have a wedding to attend to.

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,480
Just today.

95
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:16,399
Why

96
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
are you today ? It's okay,

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,240
okay, okay,

98
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,720
then I

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,439
'll call my dad

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,959
and call Xiao Qin.

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,120
Zhao

102
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,639
Jin

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,240
, I'm starting to get nervous about you

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,079
. Don't let me not be able to contact you.

105
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,199
Don't

106
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,600

107
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,240
, go back quickly

108
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,360
. Don't freeze.

109
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,120
Come on.

110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,199
Why did

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,199
you

112
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,399
sell this one for forty ? Come here often.

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,660
Feed

114
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,660
dad

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,240
and son. What’s wrong?

116
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,159
I

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
’m bringing my girlfriend home for

118
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,920
dinner tonight.

119
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,959
What’s the girlfriend

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,279
? When did you get a girlfriend

121
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,519
? She’s a girlfriend who’s getting married.

122
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:21,839
Really.

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I haven't heard you say

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,920
that. Shouldn't I take you to see you?

125
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:28,639
That's okay.

126
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,959
I'll go

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,839
get some seafood tonight.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,639
No, no, no

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,519
. Don't take

130
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,079
so much trouble . Just eat whatever

131
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,160
you want. That's okay.

132
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,399
Just leave me alone.

133
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,279
I'll come.

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,360
Done,

135
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,759
I'm starting to get nervous about you.

136
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,600
Don't let me fail to contact you.

137
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,519
This is where you

138
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,240
lived when you were young.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,040
Right.

140
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,879
It's so close to the sea.

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,319
Isn't it noisy when you sleep at night?

142
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,240
No, you're used to it. It

143
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,680
's like a lullaby. Let

144
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,680
's go .

145
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:03,920
Let's go.

146
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,519
Isn't it right?

147
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,759
I caught this new seafood today.

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,759
Why do I have a stomachache ?

149
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,639
Here’s the dipping sauce for you.

150
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,360
Xiao Jin. Come and have a drink with dad.

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
I’ll drive. Dad

152
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,360
, let

153
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,540
Xiao Xu have a drink.

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,360
You’re welcome.

155
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
The seafood I saw today

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,600
was all made by my uncle. You catch

157
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,839
everything you catch from the sea

158
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:28,339
,

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
no wonder it’s so fresh .

160
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,279
Come here, uncle, give you a drink.

161
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,519
Farewell, uncle, I toast you.

162
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,000
You have to listen to uncle.

163
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,320
Now you are with Xiao Jin.

164
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,399
Here is Xiao Qin

165
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,200
, and these two children

166
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,439
are working at your place.

167
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,639
I have to entrust you to take care of

168
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
me. As a father, I

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,960
don’t have much ability,

170
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,439
so I ’ll leave it to

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
you. You ’re too polite. Uncle,

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Dad

173
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,199
, you’re just like Tuogu.

174
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,639
I’m just a rough guy

175
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,480
and I’m not very good at talking.

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Xiao Xu, don’t mind.

177
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,399
Uncle

178
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,639
Xiao Qin is very kind. Okay,

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,120
she helped me a lot in the store.

180
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,039
Don't worry.

181
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,399
Dad, what you're talking about here

182
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,799
is like marrying

183
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
a daughter . I'm

184
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,000
my son- in-law

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
. It's not good for your son-in-law to bring a younger sister.

186
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,440
It doesn't matter if you marry

187
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,519
us. Eat first,

188
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,639
eat all this

189
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,039
, do

190
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:15,679
n't waste it.

191
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,580
Come on

192
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,279
, why are you turning the ringtone so

193
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,159
loud ?

194
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
Why aren't you picking up?

195
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
Why are you still hanging up

196
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,360
? Xiao Jin

197
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,559
, who

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,799
is it? Come on,

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,200
pick up.

200
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,679
Uncle Hanhan,

201
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,879
what are you doing?

202
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,960
I'm eating. Did

203
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,759
n't you say you wanted to

204
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,120
come and celebrate my birthday with me?

205
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Uncle, come on,

206
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
can you come ? I'll get

207
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,799
back to you in a moment.

208
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,279
No, you promised Shi Shi.

209
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,000
I forgot

210
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,559
how could I agree to Shi Shi?

211
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,139
It

212
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,360
's okay for Xiao Xu to finally come here

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,480
to celebrate the child's birthday.

214
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,360
I'll go over and coax him tomorrow.

215
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,320
You go

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,360
ahead

217
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,200
. Don't let the kids think you lied to him.

218
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,159
I went. What should you do?

219
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
I'll go with you.

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,360
Really go . I can

221
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
do it . How about

222
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,159
we all go together

223
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,600
? I love it

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,960
when it's my kid's birthday

225
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,159
. It's lively.

226
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,200
Okay, let's go together.

227
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's go together.

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,620
It's

229
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,200
delicious . Let's eat

230
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,120
. Let's eat.

231
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,759
Let's welcome Xiao Xu today.

232
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,639
That's the business

233
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,840
. Happy birthday to you.

234
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,840
Happy birthday to you

235
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,960
. Happy birthday to you . Happy

236
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,840
birthday to you. Have you

237
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,919
made a wish?

238
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
No wish from you.

239
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,320
I hope to

240
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,679
see Uncle Hanhan

241
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,759
every day.

242
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,039
Blow

243
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,000
out the candles.

244
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,559
Happy

245
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,879
birthday. Happy birthday.

246
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm here to

247
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,000
cut the cake.

248
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,679
You go up first. I'll see you off.

249
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,759
You two, don't quarrel.

250
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,879
Don't worry.

251
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,059
Goodbye.

252
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,000
Slow down . Look at

253
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,720
what I'm doing.

254
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,159
You didn't say anything the whole way

255
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,600
. I'm a little nervous.

256
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,080
Please park the car.

257
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,240
Let's go down and take a walk.

258
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,039
Where are you going

259
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,840
? Let's just take a walk.

260
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,799
What

261
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,600
are you thinking about?

262
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Are you thinking about bad things

263
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,480
?

264
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,799
I

265
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,919
can't tell you. I guess you blame

266
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,759
me for not telling you earlier that I

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,039
bumped into her in the morning

268
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,279
and stoned you in the evening.

269
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,679
I'm actually not unhappy about

270
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,720
my birthday

271
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:33,720
. Can you believe it? You

272
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,000
feel more uncomfortable than unhappy now.

273
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
It's so strange.

274
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,120
The other person

275
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
feels

276
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
like he's hurt even though he

277
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,159
didn't do anything. This should

278
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
be the most troublesome problem in

279
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,039
a relationship, right ? This is it.

280
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,600
There is no way to make up for the damage.

281
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,200
When you first told me

282
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,399
that you were married,

283
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,199
I was

284
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,559
thinking about

285
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,720
what the girl you married was

286
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,799
like. Is she beautiful?

287
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,679
Is she good-natured?

288
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,000
How long have you been together

289
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,279
and why did you break up?

290
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,879
But after seeing her today,

291
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:16,919
I realized that all those previous problems

292
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,799
were no longer important.

293
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,000
Seeing her is like

294
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,519
seeing another member of your family

295
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,159
, although it won’t be as

296
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,919
close as seeing Xiao Qin or seeing your father,

297
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,879
and we may

298
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,159
never have any interactions with each other

299
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,600
in the future . She's there,

300
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,720
she's

301
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,000
a part of your life, a

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,039
very important part.

303
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,399
That's all in

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
the past.

305
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,799
Think about

306
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,000
the fun things

307
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,039
now.

308
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,919
Okay, go to sleep.

309
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,360
What are

310
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,360
you doing ?

311
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,240
You can't

312
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,200
smoke. Okay. Come on, go

313
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,960
to bed.

314
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,200
Okay, go to sleep.

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,240
Hurry up.

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,759
Where are you going

317
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,279
? You won't sleep.

318
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm going back to sleep

319
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,799
. I'm leaving.

320
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,799
Don't leave

321
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,039
. What are you doing?

322
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,279
Sleep here .

323
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,039
My mother is alone at home.

324
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
I don't worry.

325
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,799
I'm here alone.

326
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,919
Don't worry when you sleep.

327
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:30,000
Are you not snoring in your sleep?

328
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,639
I can't stand it .

329
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,720
Then you have to get used to it

330
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,079
. Otherwise,

331
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,159
we will have to sleep in separate beds

332
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,580
in the future. Yes

333
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,159
, then if we sleep together,

334
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
then you have to agree to our conditions.

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,159
First before going to bed. You can't smoke.

336
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,879
Secondly, you can't drink before going to bed.

337
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,759
Otherwise, if you say that your snoring

338
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,279
smells of alcohol and cigarettes, I

339
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,080
have to follow your rules. If you

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,759
can't smoke

341
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:51,480
or drink,

342
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,039
then I still can't sleep.

343
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,360
I've been used to

344
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,559
it for so many years.

345
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,039
Okay, let

346
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
's go.

347
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,600
I'll sleep

348
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,860
with you

349
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,639
. What's wrong with you?

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,879
Go to bed quickly.

351
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,839
Stop watching TV. I

352
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,839
'll fall asleep in a while.

353
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,839
My mother always told me that

354
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,400
feelings are accumulated over time

355
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:14,879
, so she doesn't agree with

356
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,759
me being with you.

357
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,639
Because she feels that the relationship

358
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,039
I have had with Peng Yuan

359
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,118
for so many years

360
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,319
cannot be replaced by you.

361
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,200
In fact, she does the same. She

362
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
has had several relationships

363
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
after my dad separated

364
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,279
, but she has never been able to stay with anyone for

365
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,440
a long time

366
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,039
. As long as there is something

367
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,519
she doesn't like. She can't stand even

368
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,599
my little habits

369
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,720
, but she

370
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,119
has put up with my dad

371
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,919
for so many years before

372
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,359
. Now she still wants to remarry my dad.

373
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,440
What are you worried about?

374
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,599
I'm worried that we won't win

375
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,119
. The more time we are together, the more we will win.

376
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,400
You can't keep thinking about the past for

377
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,160
a minute.

378
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,359
You have to think about

379
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,559
the future. In the days to come,

380
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,079
we both have a lot of time,

381
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,880
enough for me to

382
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,720
slowly understand your bad habits

383
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,439
. I don't have any bad habits.

384
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,279
Then let me

385
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,319
discover some bad

386
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,039
habits. Living with

387
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:26,959
someone

388
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,079
doesn't mean

389
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,480
how good their relationship is

390
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,480
. Maybe it's just a habit.

391
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,039
It's actually very difficult

392
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,680
to change someone's habit.

393
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,439
The older you get, the less you want to change.

394
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,599
So you also think

395
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,519
my mother is with My dad

396
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,559
is just used to being together. We still

397
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
have

398
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,119
feelings.

399
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,640
But you can’t

400
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,839
distinguish this kind of thing so clearly.

401
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,200
Feelings are also a habit.

402
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,640
You can’t explain it clearly

403
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,880
. I don’t need to explain it clearly.

404
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,440
We are together.

405
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
You just need to know. You like me and

406
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,759
I like you,

407
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,759
you

408
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
don’t even need to ask why you like

409
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,359
me . Anyway, it’s good to

410
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
just keep liking me like this for the rest of your life.

411
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,960
You don’t know why

412
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,599
you like me.

413
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,680
Where did you come from? Silly child

414
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,519
from the Promise family.

415
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Let’s move on.

416
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,200
What

417
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,039
’s wrong with

418
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,799
me ? Forget about the leg cramps

419
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,559
. Come up,

420
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,759
up, up, up.

421
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,200
Come on

422
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,399
, stand

423
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
up. Now you can lift your legs

424
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,559
and walk . Does it still hurt

425
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,319
? It seems better.

426
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,359
Let me down.

427
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,680
I won't let you down.

428
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,759
Don't you feel like you

429
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,039
have to win in one minute now

430
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,079
? One week before can win a year.

431
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,559
When

432
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,000
it is over,

433
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,519
we will all be

434
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,599
thousands of old monsters.

435
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,200
Wait a minute, old

436
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
monster, look here

437
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,799
. I heard who you went to see yesterday.

438
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,680
The information

439
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,359
is quite well-informed. I don’t know what you think.

440
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:52,879
Why are you going to give it to

441
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,039
others ? It's his son's birthday.

442
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,279
Zhao Jin promised him before.

443
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,519
I also wanted to go and see him together

444
00:21:58,839 --> 00:21:59,720
. Then

445
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,839
I felt really bad after seeing him,

446
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
so I didn't

447
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:03,680
sleep well when I got back

448
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,319
. I haven't seen you yet

449
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:06,680
, and the dark circles under your eyes

450
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,720
have fallen to your chin

451
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,440
. With your face

452
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
I can't sleep well when I look at it.

453
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,920
Is it true? I put

454
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,960
on makeup. We have passed

455
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,119
the age where applying powder will

456
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,079
make us shine. No matter

457
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,279
how thick the foundation is, it can't cover

458
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
the traces left by the years on our face

459
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,960
, so

460
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,839
we can't waste time.

461
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,799
I need to spend more time with the people I love.

462
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,960
But the person I love the most is you.

463
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,519
The time I spend with you

464
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,359
is the longest

465
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,599
. It's a pity . I can't marry you

466
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,400
in

467
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,359
the next life. I won't have to

468
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,519
clean up your mess in the next life. I

469
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,319
'm so tired.

470
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,039
Okay. Come

471
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,279
on down and see

472
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:49,960
how it goes.

473
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,079
I can only tell you beautiful

474
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,799
with the only English word

475
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:55,640
I know

476
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,160
. You said when can I

477
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,359
hold a wedding like this

478
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,599
for myself ?

479
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,839
What’s wrong?

480
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,920
I want to get married

481
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,319
. If I don’t get married,

482
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,480
I will become a yellow face. Are you married

483
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,079
?

484
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,359
What did Xu Yang say about

485
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,559
Xu Yang ? Xu Yang

486
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,359
is just a blockhead

487
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
in relationships

488
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:17,440
. When he tells me about this , maybe

489
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,480
your children

490
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,680
can go to kindergarten.

491
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,039
Then hurry up and

492
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,759
try to fight for our children

493
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,720
to go to kindergarten together.

494
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,079
I am

495
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,799
married. Is it useful if I hurry up?

496
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Besides,

497
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,680
it’s not necessarily who

498
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,639
you marry. What are you waiting for?

499
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,079
I don’t know what I’m waiting for.

500
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,599
I just feel that

501
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,279
who can say for sure what will happen in the future,

502
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,039
right?

503
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,279
Do you think people’s hearts will really change?

504
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,079
Then I can’t ask you. Ah,

505
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
what is the reason why you broke up

506
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
with Peng Yuan

507
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,519
? You don’t understand

508
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,319
it yet. So people’s hearts will change.

509
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,000
What remains the same

510
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,480
is human nature. Look, tell me

511
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,119
. Human nature doesn’t change. Hey, let’s

512
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,720
meet

513
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,720
.

514
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,839
I have something to talk to you about. Are

515
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,160
you in the store?

516
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,160
I'll come over to find you.

517
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,680
I'm outside and

518
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,960
working.

519
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:16,960
How about that

520
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,319
? I'll wait for you downstairs at your house.

521
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,160
We'll talk about

522
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,019
it

523
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,839
when you're done. Okay. It's not calming down. It's starting

524
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,559
again . Stop

525
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,680
making trouble

526
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,460
and go to work.

527
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,799
Is there anyone else in

528
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,200
that locker room?

529
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,759
Coach Xu is the only one in there.

530
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,640
Okay, I'll go find him.

531
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,799
What are you blocking? Why is

532
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,799
this men's locker room

533
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,119
here?

534
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,039
What if someone else is here?

535
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,599
Who asked you to send you a message

536
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,480
and you didn't reply

537
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,359
? Come back,

538
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,119
why are you here if

539
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,880
you don't work during the day?

540
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,640
I just finished working on the

541
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,599
wedding scene and

542
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,799
I thought I'd have nothing to do

543
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,720
to see you.

544
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,359
Then you

545
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,160
go wait for me outside for a while and

546
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll change clothes.

547
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,400
There's no one here. I asked you just now

548
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,400
. You're the only one inside. People

549
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,119
will arrive in a while.

550
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,879
I'll just go out

551
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,519
. It's up to you.

552
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:53,319
Are

553
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,399
you busy?

554
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,839
Sit over there.

555
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,680
I have something serious to do and I

556
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
want to discuss it with you

557
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,639
. Have you ever thought about where to hold the

558
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,599
wedding ?

559
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,400
For example,

560
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,759
the beach or

561
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,879
a hotel.

562
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,119
Or a garden.

563
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,480
It doesn't matter.

564
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,680
Do you like a Chinese wedding

565
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,119
or a Western wedding?

566
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,799
It doesn't matter what

567
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,440
season

568
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,559
you like.

569
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
It

570
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,399
does

571
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,039
n't matter

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,119
what season you want to have the wedding in. It doesn't matter.

573
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,059
No

574
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,079
, it doesn't matter who you marry,

575
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:47,619
right

576
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,359
? But no,

577
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,559
this person must

578
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,359
be you .

579
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,599
Look

580
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,400
at me.

581
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,559
I'm telling you seriously.

582
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,640
Have you ever

583
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,559
thought

584
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,759
about getting married

585
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,519
? Have you ever thought about it? Why didn't you say it

586
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,640
? You

587
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,279
asked me to say it here

588
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,680
. You say it now.

589
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,039
Why are you still in a hurry?

590
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,279
Can

591
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,160
I not be in a hurry

592
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,079
? I have always been anxious about this matter. Why aren't you in a hurry?

593
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,059
My

594
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
marriage is

595
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,799
something I can do in a hurry by myself

596
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,480
. Why are you still crying?

597
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,319
I feel like it's all just me.

598
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
You're working hard,

599
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,240
you don't care about these things

600
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,000
at all.

601
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Just don't

602
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,920
be angry.

603
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,160
Let go.

604
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,640
It's not

605
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,119
you . Don't cry. I'm

606
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
giving you a fitness meal

607
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,400
. Don't cry.

608
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,879
Everyone is watching.

609
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
I don't want to talk to you now.

610
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,759
Do you want to? Come to me again when you're clear.

611
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,259
No,

612
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,079
Shi Ran

613
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,359
, please

614
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,400
help us get to and from the coffee bar.

615
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,319
Thank you . Do

616
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,559
you remember this place?

617
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,880
Remember the place

618
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,279
where we first dated.

619
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,640
It's been so many years.

620
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,400
I know

621
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
there are some things that I put off for too long

622
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
, but I decided now. Marry

623
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,359
me,

624
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,599
let’s get married.

625
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,680
If you don’t agree,

626
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,039
I won’t stand up.

627
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,279
I’m doing this for your own good.

628
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,299
Promise,

629
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:21,679
promise.

630
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,879
I really can’t accept

631
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,240
you, and you don’t know

632
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,640
how to comfort me.

633
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,400
I’ve been crying here

634
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,400
for half an hour. Why

635
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,880
are you so cruel?

636
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Can this comfort you? If you like what

637
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,599
you gave me

638
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
, take it.

639
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:01,919
No,

640
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,839
isn't this? Could it be

641
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,039
? Peng Yu'an gave it to you, right?

642
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,400
There's something wrong with your brain

643
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,640
. You took it back,

644
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,039
you keep it. He

645
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,960
insisted on giving it to me,

646
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,200
and I couldn’t throw it away in front of him.

647
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,960
I could only turn around and give it back to him.

648
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,319
Is he acting in an idol drama? Then you

649
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,079
can just throw it

650
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,400
in front of him

651
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,640
. I thought so too

652
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,279
, but then I Think about it, you said that

653
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,039
I don’t have

654
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:30,960
any deep grudge

655
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,119
against him. Why should I be

656
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,359
so cruel? You are

657
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,599
still reluctant to let go of

658
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,720
him, right? I have no feelings

659
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,119
for him anymore.

660
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:42,759
I won’t even be angry for him. Do

661
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,440
you think

662
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,680
people’s hearts are very cunning? Ah,

663
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,240
it

664
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
's very cunning.

665
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,740
Hey,

666
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,440
Peng Yuan is going to marry Xunuo.

667
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,279
What did you say?

668
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,759
Peng Yuan said it himself.

669
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,879
You said he told me this. Why do

670
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,960
you want you to tell me

671
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,519
? The expression on Peng Yuan's face seems

672
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
to be very happy. It

673
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,799
feels like it's

674
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:41,799
coming soon . How about

675
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,160
a wedding ?

676
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,799
Do you agree to

677
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,639
his proposal ?

678
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,240
You won't be fooled.

679
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,639
I'll call you later.

680
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,559
Doctor Zhao ,

681
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,519
is everything okay

682
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,079
? Brother

683
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:16,639
Yu An

684
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,960
has finished reporting to Zhao Jin

685
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,399
. You

686
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,720
're not Brother Yu An

687
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,799
, eavesdropping on people's phone calls. It's not good

688
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,279
. I want to eavesdrop. You

689
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,799
are so loud.

690
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,519
Who can't hear?

691
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,720
There is no discharge from the eyes.

692
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,279
There is no redness, swelling

693
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,480
or bleeding in the mouth.

694
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:44,720
It's okay

695
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:46,599
.

696
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,200
Just

697
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
bring some disinfectant. Hey, Coach Zhao,

698
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,480
please take some time to meet

699
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,800
. I'm very busy and don't have time.

700
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't you all know?

701
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,559
What are you going to do

702
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,800
? Wait until I'm done. Come on,

703
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,320
you're not hiding from me.

704
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,199
You're overthinking

705
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,199
me

706
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,599
. I'll leave first

707
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,559
. What are you doing?

708
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,360
Give me my bottle of wine.

709
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,079
Thank

710
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,199
you. Do you know

711
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,159
where they want to meet? I don't know

712
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,679
.

713
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:44,679
Then how do you know

714
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,440
they want to meet

715
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
me ? I'll give Xu Yang the phone number

716
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:47,719
and you can tell him.

717
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,960
Call him

718
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,239
, promise.

719
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,119
I asked Dahao just now and

720
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:54,960
he doesn't know

721
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
where they met. Do you know what

722
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,239
Zhao Jin wants to find Peng Yuan

723
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
for?

724
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:01,559
I don't know for sure

725
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:03,079
, but

726
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,599
don't worry. Look at this

727
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,599
Zhao Jin

728
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,159
is usually quite gentle, but he is a ruthless person.

729
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,679
What does

730
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,159
that mean?

731
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,960
Don’t talk too much.

732
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,079
What I mean is that

733
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,360
you can trust him unconditionally. He

734
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,079
is very responsible

735
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,239
and will not let you down.

736
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,960
I know. Dahao

737
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,440
, I should tell you everything, right?

738
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,880
What else do you want to know from me?

739
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,800
How long do you want to torture Xu Nuo

740
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,039
before you are willing to accept it?

741
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,039
What qualifications do you have

742
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:00,960
to say these things?

743
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,519
Young man, don’t be too arrogant.

744
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,960
I can be more arrogant

745
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,639
before you. Have you gone to see

746
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,840
Promise's parents?

747
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,719
I can tell them myself

748
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,360
that you don't have to worry about me from now on.

749
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,119
You are very courageous.

750
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,519
I can be more courageous

751
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,519
. Do you think you understand me?

752
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,519
I know very well

753
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,719
what you did behind your back

754
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,320
compared to losing Promise. The thing

755
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,119
is just that I'm afraid of losing to me.

756
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,519
What can I do if you win?

757
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
As you said,

758
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,159
I 'm just an

759
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,559
ordinary person with nothing to

760
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,400
offer.

761
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,280
It would be more embarrassing

762
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,159
if you compete with me

763
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,280
. Then do you think the parents who made the promise

764
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,519
will accept something like this? Are you a person like you?

765
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:53,480
Isn't it more important

766
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,879
to accept a promise?

767
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,440
I hope you don't think that

768
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,159
this is just

769
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,079
advice given to you by

770
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,000
someone you don't like.

771
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,440
If you continue like this, you

772
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
will only become more and more naive.

773
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,320
That's it. That's

774
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:20,880
it. Okay,

775
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,199
as long as you are willing. Quit

776
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,199
what you just said,

777
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,760
I can think about

778
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,400
how

779
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,118
you can't even do it yourself.

780
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,159
Why should you ask others for

781
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:40,440
things that you can't do yourself ?

782
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,679
I'm really looking forward to

783
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:46,519
you meeting your promised parents.

784
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,679
I can imagine

785
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,199
how they will humiliate you.

786
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,599
I'm going to give up

787
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,400
so quickly.

788
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,360
The game hasn't even started yet.

789
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,679
I'm talking about you.

790
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,639
I tried to respect you before

791
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,239
, but not after.

792
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,280
What I want to give up

793
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,519
is you.

794
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:29,840
You said

795
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,360
the two of them

796
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
wouldn't really fight. Come on,

797
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
you guys are really

798
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,320
in your thirties

799
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,480
and you are still so childish.

800
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,039
Isn’t it

801
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,719
for you women? Why are

802
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320
you always spinning this plate? I ’m

803
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,239
eating a cake

804
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,880
and you are spinning this plate.

805
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,639
I want you to taste this. Come on,

806
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,280
will you

807
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,039
fight with others for me?

808
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,360
No,

809
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,559
why should I fight?

810
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,039
I am your girlfriend.

811
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,000
For example,

812
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,199
if I was bullied,

813
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
wouldn't you

814
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,199
fight with others for me?

815
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:04,659
This

816
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,599
fight can't solve the problem

817
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,360
. It can make the problem more serious.

818
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,719
Either

819
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,960
you fight for your girlfriend

820
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:11,880
or you have a

821
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,960
spirit of heroism, okay

822
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:14,539
?

823
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,039
But why?

824
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,639
There are so many reasons.

825
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,039
I just ask you if you are willing to

826
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:20,880
fight for me.

827
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,800
I do it for you and

828
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,079
me. You can do a lot of things

829
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,558
, you do n’t have to fight.

830
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,718
I just said that,

831
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,920
and I don’t have to ask you

832
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,559
to fight with others.

833
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,360
What’s wrong with your brain?

834
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,760
Are you a brain?

835
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,800
Your brain is dead, right?

836
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:33,599
Don’t eat it.

837
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,360
Don’t be angry .

838
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,639
Don’t eat it after one bite.

839
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,000
I 've lost my appetite

840
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,800
and don't want to eat

841
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,400
the cake. It's quite expensive.

842
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,239
Don't be angry

843
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,800
. Come and have

844
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880
a bite. Don't think

845
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,159
that if you give me a bite of cake,

846
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,199
we will be fine .

847
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,119
My anger level

848
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,440
has already reached my forehead.

849
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,638
You know that you are going to be finished.

850
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:57,239
You know that. I

851
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,480
know you calm down.

852
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,480
Take a

853
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:01,539
bite .

854
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,480
What kind of

855
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:12,880
ring is this?

856
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,800
You are

857
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,440
talking nonsense. I can’t see

858
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,359
what this is a ring.

859
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:19,840
What does it mean?

860
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
What else can it mean?

861
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,239
How much did

862
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,639
you buy this

863
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,039
ring covered with cake

864
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,880
? It’s quite expensive anyway.

865
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,719
You are so tacky.

866
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,679
You just

867
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,480
put this ring in this cake in

868
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,559
a small cafe like this

869
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,360
. What should I do if you

870
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,900
are tacky?

871
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,000
Give me the ring back and

872
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:52,960
I will re-arrange

873
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,320
it

874
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,039
. You

875
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,079
are so stupid. What's going on?

876
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,900
I,

877
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,840
I can return the ring.

878
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,679
If you dare to return one, try it. I 'll put a black eye on your

879
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,320
eye.

880
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,639
Don't you just say it's cliche

881
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
? I'll do it all over

882
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,199
again. You shut up.

883
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,000
Do you

884
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,559
like it

885
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,679
? If you don't like

886
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,119
it ,

887
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,559
otherwise, I

888
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,159
'll give it to you. Put it on.

889
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:26,920
Have you wiped it off?

890
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,559
I'll put it on for you.

891
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,099
Are you

892
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,840
here ?

893
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,360
This is all cake.
