<b >You won’t really give it to him</b>

565
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,399
<b>Otherwise</b>

566
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,759
<b>Peng Yuan is looking for you again</b>

567
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,319
<b>No, he is not looking for me</b>

<b>He is downstairs</b>

569
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,879
<b>Tell him you are here with me</b>

570
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,359
<b>He should be looking for Zhao Jin</b>

571

<b>How does he know Zhao Jin Jin</b>

572
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:45,919
<b>Live here</b>

573
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,059

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,640
<b>How about the two of us</b>

575
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,440
<b>Let’s take a look</b>

576
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,399
<b> What if they fight?</b>

577
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,880
<b>No way</b>

578
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,319
<b>They are not children</b>

579
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,799
<b>Why not</b>

580
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,359
<b>What if If it were you</b>

581
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,759
<b>Would you speak politely

<b>Which one of them do you think is better?</b>

587
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
<b>Isn’t Zhao Jin the coach?</b>

588
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,720

590
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,200
<b>This is a fight, not a competition</b>

591
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,359
<b>It has no rules</b>

592
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,919
<b>So we can only see who is tougher</b>

593
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,960
<b> Which one do you think is more ruthless?</b>

594
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,399
<b>It’s hard to say</b>

595

<b>This now puts all the responsibility</b>

605
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,160
<b> It's unreasonable

607
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,959
<b>That's what I say</b>

608
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,839
