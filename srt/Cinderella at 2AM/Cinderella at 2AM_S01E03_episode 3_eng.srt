1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,380
   

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,470
   

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,410
   

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,980
   

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,320
   

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:34,940


7
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,130
   

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,010
   

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,360
   

10
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:05,280
♫  You're a small boat floating in the sea  ♫

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,150
♫  The warm breeze  ♫

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,600
 The day I returned from studying abroad two years ago. 

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,690
A crying selfie? So dated!

14
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,470
Honey, look at the AL Vice Chairman's crying selfie.

15
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,190
What? Seriously?

16
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,170
This is so pathetic.

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,330
I'm getting the ick.

18
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,250
   

19
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,140
   

20
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,460
 The day my brother posted a crying selfie drunk 

21
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,040
 and was permanently banned from social media. 

22
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,350
This is so humiliating.

23
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,430
Get in.

24
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,160
- What? 
 - What?

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,790
I told you I'd take a cab. You didn't have to come.

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Did you miss me that much?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,110
Is that why you were crying?

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,310
Hey!

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,110
Stop it. I have enough to be upset about already.

30
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,550
How come you came back earlier than planned?

31
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,020
I thought you were coming back next month.

32
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,490
I was, but...

33
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,950
I heard the new employees start next week. I will, too.

34
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,200
Are you really going to hide who you are?

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Whose idea was that?

36
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
It was our mother's cautious suggestion.

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,160
She said that when you started, the other employees were extremely uncomfortable.

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,600
You made it so obvious that you were a third-generation chaebol.

39
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,450
Hey. I wasn't making it obvious.

40
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,280
It's just obvious that I am. What can I do about it?

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,580
There's nothing I can do about it.

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,240
But I think you could...

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,090
pass for not being rich.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,870
Hey!

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,680
Anyway, get ready. Work isn't easy.

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,980
Hyeong.

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,330
I'm Seo Ju Won.

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,040
Don't you know me?

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
I don't know.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,390
I don't know what criteria you used to organize this.

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,950
You should have asked me. Why didn't you?

52
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm sorry. You looked busy so I tried to do it myself...

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,500
Seo Ju Won, don't make things worse moving forward.

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,000
Report to me in advance. You've only been here for a month.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,440
Got it.

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,000
 Deputy Ha Yun Seo was my superior. 

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,340
 At first, I didn't like her much. 

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,330
 She was picky, icy, and a little... 

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,710
- Scary, right? 
 - Yes.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,520
What? No.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,070
What do you mean? She was eating you for lunch.

62
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,380
I know. She thinks everyone's a legendary newbie like her.

63
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,950
A "legendary newbie"?

64
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,060
- Yes. 
 - When her peers were flailing,

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,360
she volunteered to work late every day and learned the ropes in a week.

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,830
She joined marketing experts' clubs and went out every weekend to learn.

67
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,340
In two months, she took over all of her superior's tasks...

68
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,710
or whatever.

69
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,770
You don't look good. Did you mess up or something?

70
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,890
- No. 
 - What do you mean?

71
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,380
I can tell you got chewed out. I see that face every day at work.

72
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Work is different than you thought, right?

73
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,140
You're having a hard time, right?

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,740
No.

75
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,080
 That's what I said, 

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
 but it was hard. 

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,770
Ju Won.

78
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,630
You still don't know how to use a copy machine?

79
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,430
- I'm sorry. 
 - So slow.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,040
Team Leader, I looked over the data report from last quarter...

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,670
Me? Asking me? Are you skipping over the deputies to ask me?

82
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,330
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,540
The coffee is here.

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,010
Hot tea for you, Deputy.

85
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,390
Ju Won, why is there so little liquid?

86
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,810
Did you have a sip?

87
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,800
No, no.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,640
You'd better watch it.

89
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,560
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,790
- Hyeong. 
 - Yes?

91
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,430
I've been thinking that if I wasn't the second son of AL Group,

92
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,040
I would be such an inadequate person.

93
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,180
Geez.

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,850
We have a staff dinner again tomorrow.

95
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,570
Hyung, can you teach me how to mix somaek*? 
  (*Beer mixed with soju) 

96
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,490
How would I know that?

97
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,600
Why? Does somebody want you to mix somaek?

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,720
Yes. They want the "golden ratio" or something. I've never done it.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,990
Look it up.

100
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,150
Okay.

101
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,620
Team Leader, let me mix it.

102
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,550
- All right! Mix it well! 
 - Okay.

103
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,620
He gets the job done.

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,830
You have to train him well.

105
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,680
Aigoo! So frustrating. I'll sober up while I'm waiting!

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm sorry. I'll hurry.

107
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,930
Hurry, hurry!

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,190
Geez! Hurry!

109
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,240
Are you trying to kill me?

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,240
How did you not learn how to mix somaek all your life?

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,520
When I was your age and trying to get a job, I studied English during the day

112
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,440
and somaek at night! Geez!

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,250
- That's what I mean. 
 - What is wrong with you?

114
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,580
Give it to me! Let me show you.

115
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,670
Applause!

116
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,240
Stop, stop.

117
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
I don't show this to just anybody.

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,090
Look, look. Half this glass, half this glass.

119
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,990
Beer! I can do it with my eyes closed. Just follow me.

120
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,690
See? Let's go!

121
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,970
Let's go!

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,170
Team Leader, I'm going to the bathroom.

123
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,400
You know how to be a downer, don't you? Go!

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,380
Hurry, hurry! Go to the bathroom.

125
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,720
Where is he going?

126
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,680
So frustrating...

127
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,900
Nice...

128
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,070
This is hard.

129
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,380
   

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
- What? 
  - Dude. 

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,950
 Don't "what" the Vice Chairman, newbie. 

132
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm giving you an opportunity to spend time with the Vice Chairman.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,030
Let's play tennis this weekend.

134
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,200
 No thanks. 

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,990
I don't do well with tennis.

136
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,970
I know it's hard to get better in a short time, but...

137
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,420
it doesn't work as I thought it would.

138
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,440
I don't feel accomplished.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,530
I'm just going to quit.

140
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,820
Bye.

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,480
Are you going to quit?

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,830
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I heard.

143
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,300
It's hard, right? Work.

144
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,380
All I've done is criticize you and not tell you this, but...

145
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,550
Ju Won, you're doing great.

146
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,650
You've gotten better at work, and...

147
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,060
Your trend research report was very good.

148
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,190
Thank you.

149
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,090
I hope you don't quit, Ju Won.

150
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,310
Oh, it wasn't work I said I'd quit—

151
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,770
If you quit without surviving this time-period,

152
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,050
it'll be the same anywhere else

153
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,960
so try to stick it out just one more day.

154
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,900
Then a week will pass,

155
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,320
a month, a year...

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,250
Time flies.

157
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,680
I'd like to see what you're like

158
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,780
in a year, Ju Won.

159
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,500
- Here we go! Let's go! 
 - Chug, chug!

160
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,400
Here! Everybody, cheers!

161
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,760
Cheers!

162
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,370
What? He looks fine. Why are you drinking for him?

163
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,830
Are you two dating or something?

164
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,670
Team Leader.

165
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,520
Don't you know I love alcohol?

166
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,390
Why do you keep pouring drinks only for Ju Won?

167
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,980
I'd like a glass from you, too, Team Leader.

168
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,240
That's right! Let me pour you one.

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,410
Our amazing Deputy Ha wants to drink! Let me pour you a glass.

170
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,330
- My glass is empty! 
 - Aigoo, here you go!

171
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,170
Deputy Bae, you're a good drinker.

172
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,480
I'm going to fill up your glass.

173
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,370
- Drink, drink. Got it? 
 - I gave him some.

174
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,720
 Cheers! 

175
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,690
Thank you!

176
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,370
 I think it was that moment 

177
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,270
 that I started seeing Ha Yun Seo not just as a good boss 

178
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,770
 but as a good person. 

179
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,010
♫  The more I get to know ya, can't tell the feelings I feel  ♫

180
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,000
♫  Sometimes it doesn't feel so right  ♫

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,100
♫  I try many times, but it doesn't work the way I want  ♫

182
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,580
♫  I think I'm losing my whole mind  ♫

183
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,890
 My eyes kept lingering on her. 

184
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,880
♫  Same unusual feeling  ♫

185
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,600
♫  It's too complicated to say, I want to know what you think  ♫

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
♫  Do you feel just like I do?  ♫

187
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,630
 I found myself thinking, "She has a pretty smile." 

188
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,160
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

189
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,290
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

190
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,520
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

191
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,850
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend?  ♫

192
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,550
♫  Call me back when you're sober, I'm afraid I might just love ya  ♫

193
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,960
♫  Want to throw my hands up a thousand times  ♫

194
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,370
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

195
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,890
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend?  ♫

196
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,600
 That's how I started to like you. 

197
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,200
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

198
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,770
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend?  ♫

199
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,380
   

200
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,260
Call him.

201
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,420
I'm leaving.

202
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,660
Wh-What? What are you doing?

203
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,320
Yun Seo.

204
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,720
Let me ask you one thing.

205
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,350
Will you really break up with me?

206
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,760
Don't you like me anymore?

207
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,510
No.

208
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,450
I still...

209
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,330
like you a lot.

210
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,900
I...

211
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,830
I mean...

212
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,220
This is not right.

213
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,830
Why isn't it?

214
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,180
You know!

215
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,650
A kiss between people who are broken up?

216
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,010
Gosh, you know better. What's wrong with you?

217
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,300
But you said you still like me a lot.

218
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,520
I love you a lot, too.

219
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,140
We were happy.

220
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,150
We loved each other.

221
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,800
So how can you just throw me out like an old shoe?

222
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,580
How can you do this to me?

223
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,400
I gave you all the love I have.

224
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,500
- Are you crazy? 
 - I...

225
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,600
gave you my body and heart!

226
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,210
How can you take my mother's money and leave me?

227
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,280
How can you take her money and leave me...

228
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,160
So that girl took money from the guy's mom?

229
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,030
Yes. Then she dumped him right away.

230
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,680
He even gave her his body.

231
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,280
I feel sorry for him. That's so sad.

232
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,410
Yun Seo...

233
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,610
Yun Seo!

234
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,850
Don't leave me.

235
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,580
Shut up.

236
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,750
Shut up!

237
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,910
Seo Ju Won, wake up.

238
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,290
Wake up! Hurry.

239
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,940
Why are you here so early?

240
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,900
I'm here early to report something to Mother.

241
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,100
I was informed that you came home totally smashed.

242
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,700
Here.

243
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,820
Hey...

244
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,130
You hate to put your guard down. You never drink this much.

245
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,880
Who did you drink with that you got so wasted?

246
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,300
Did you drink with Yun Seo?

247
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,940
My brother, I'm worried about you.

248
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,620
If you want her back, stop drinking.

249
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,020
- Why? 
 - Why do you think?

250
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,200
It's no good showing her your drunk side.

251
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,990
Why do you think I set up a home bar to drink by myself?

252
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,120
Drinking makes your face all loose. It makes you look ugly.

253
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,000
And slurring your true feelings on top of that? It's the worst.

254
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,240
It's fine. I don't do stuff like-

255
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,770
 How can you just throw me out like an old shoe? 

256
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,730
 How can you do this to me? 

257
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,840
 I gave you all the love I have. 

258
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,610
 How can you take my mother's money? 

259
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,050
Hyeong, what do I do?

260
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,230
What's wrong?

261
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,190
I was the worst last night.

262
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,320
 I, Seo Ju Won, 

263
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,250
 am a clean guy who cannot come across as messy. 

264
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,490
 I want to wash everything away with water. 

265
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,900
 Even the bad memories. 

266
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,810
 I... 

267
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,580
 gave you my body and heart! 

268
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,640
Why did I say that? So humiliating.

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,580
Why? Why? Why?

270
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,770
 That was crazy! Crazy! 

271
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,990
"I still like you a lot"?

272
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,450
Why did I say such a thing? For what?

273
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,430
Why did I close my eyes? For what?

274
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,750
What?

275
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,660
What are you doing?

276
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,380
Last night wasn't enough? Are you drinking again?

277
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,500
I'm not drinking. I'm quitting.

278
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,550
From this moment on, there is no alcohol in Ha Yun Seo's life.

279
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,840
This is all because of alcohol. I'm never drinking again!

280
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,180
Give me a break.

281
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,650
I bet my entire net worth of 15,000 won that you can't quit.

282
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,400
What kind of trouble did you get into?

283
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,380
 

284
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,050
He's not here yet.

285
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,700
Well, he was really drunk last night.

286
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,800
Maybe he blacked out and doesn't remember anything.

287
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,640
I hope I have that kind of luck.

288
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,200
Luck?

289
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,270
Why are you hoping for luck?

290
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,100
You bought lottery tickets! Or some kind of investment?

291
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,490
No. It's nothing.

292
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,930
No?

293
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,250
- Hello. 
 - Good morning.

294
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,060
Okay. See you later.

295
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,410
Leaving already? Do you have a meeting?

296
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,240
No...

297
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,580
Then, everyone, fighting!

298
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,430
 Fighting! 

299
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,170
Director! Your office is over there.

300
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,160
Right, over there.

301
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,460
Your big office...

302
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:58,030
 Luck, my ass. He definitely remembers everything! 

303
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
 I think I was pathetic again just now. 

304
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,560
Gosh, seriously.

305
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,110
 Why is she acting like that? 

306
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,500
What?

307
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,760
You know, my sister.

308
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,530
She came home wasted last night, and she dumped all the alcohol out this morning.

309
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,760
I think she got drunk and did something terrible. What could it be?

310
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,190
By the way, is your sister pretty?

311
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,770
Why do you ask?

312
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,950
I'm just curious.

313
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,700
She is pretty.

314
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,460
You brought a lot of money today?

315
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,920
You totally did.

316
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,700
What are you doing?

317
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,570
Oh, nothing.

318
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,120
Don't worry. Let's go. Let's go.

319
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,690
Poor guy.

320
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,570
Getting mugged yesterday and today mercilessly.

321
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,660
They treated us to karaoke and games with the stolen money.

322
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,270
- Really? 
 - Yes.

323
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,880
I don't want to be associated with them.

324
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,840
Should we go get some lunch?

325
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm so tired from working late these days. Samgyetang*? 
  (*Korean Chicken soup) 

326
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,920
I have some stuff to look over.

327
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,870
Go ahead.

328
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,480
Okay.

329
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:35,240
Director, is samgyetang okay for lunch?

330
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,780
Let me give you one of my legs!

331
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,230
Not mine, the chicken's.

332
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,040
You get it, right?

333
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,450
I get it, but I have some stuff to look over. Go ahead.

334
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,970
Team Leader also said she had the stuff to look over.

335
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,440
Then why don't you two have this with coffee while you work?

336
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,940
- I'll go for samgyetang— 
 - I'll go for samgyetang—

337
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,380
- Never mind. 
 - Never mind.

338
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,630
Is this a choir contest? Why are you in unison?

339
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,660
I know. It's as if you've synced your lips.

340
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,410
Anyway, when you're not sure whether to eat or not, it's better to eat.

341
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,130
The later we go, the longer the wait. Let's go.

342
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,090
He's right! Let's go! You need fuel to work!

343
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,810
- Let's go! 
 - Okay...

344
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,390
Does it sound good?

345
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,330
Welcome.

346
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:33,870
Hello.

347
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,070
- Four, please. 
 - Aigoo, four?

348
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,420
Oh, no. You might have to split up.

349
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,510
Oh, then I'll sit with Ye Yeong.

350
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,050
This way?

351
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,540
Oh, wait. Deputy Bae...

352
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,710
the design team is asking to move our 4 p.m. meeting to 1:30 p.m. Is that possible?

353
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,840
Let's talk about it while we eat.

354
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,710
Let's do that.

355
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,890
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,320
We need to discuss urgent work matters. We'll eat quickly and go back.

357
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,170
Enjoy!

358
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,650
Enjoy.

359
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,100
 What do I do? 

360
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,740
 We can't just keep sitting here awkwardly. 

361
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,460
 Should I just lay it all out? 

362
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,720
 I could act cool and be like, "Sometimes exes get drunk and do that." 

363
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,450
Why are you...

364
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,080
What?

365
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,620
I like pepper.

366
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,340
Oh, my.

367
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,230
We ordered chicken.

368
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,210
But we got a hedgehog.

369
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,250
I'll eat the hedgehog.

370
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,290
No, I'll eat...

371
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,610
I'm okay, though...

372
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,590
I behaved badly last night when I got drunk, right?

373
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,990
No, I was worse.

374
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,600
- No, I was way worse. 
 - Hello.

375
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,750
Can we talk in my office?

376
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,500
Should we?

377
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,080
- One second. I'll be there after this call. 
 - Okay.

378
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm here to see Ju Won.

379
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,880
But no one's here.

380
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,900
He said he was taking a call. I'll let him know you're—

381
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm sorry that I couldn't fulfill my promise

382
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,600
to transfer Ju Won abroad.

383
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,280
He said it was hard to leave right away.

384
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,850
He wanted to get over his feelings near you.

385
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,190
I know that doesn't make sense, but I agreed.

386
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,460
Because I trust you, Ha Yun Seo.

387
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,730
That day, I took a liking to you, Ha Yun Seo.

388
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,150
When you said you were good at recognizing reality,

389
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,470
it made an impression on me.

390
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,440
You can keep your promise to break up

391
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,570
with Ju Won, right?

392
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
I came here to get a report.

393
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,100
I stopped by to see how you were doing.

394
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,700
When the employees get back after their meeting, they'd be uncomfortable to see you here.

395
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,950
I'll walk you out.

396
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,200
Did I put you on the spot by visiting you so suddenly?

397
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Rather than that, I felt uncomfortable.

398
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,420
It sounds like you don't want me to ever come back.

399
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,060
- Is that so? 
 - I know what you're concerned about

400
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,830
but you won't be disappointed. That's what I mean.

401
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,190
Let's go.

402
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,300
 Yes, I understand. 

403
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,110
 I will break up with Ju Won. 

404
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:42,660
 A pragmatic and bold young lady, icy as a frozen flower, 

405
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,120
looks at him like this?

406
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,470
My son.

407
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,750
 I have a meeting off-site. I'll be going home after. 

408
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,710
What's going on?

409
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,920
Yi Rae.

410
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,900
What's wrong with Yun Seo?

411
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,480
What do you mean? Maybe she feels like washing rice.

412
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,660
Yi Rae.

413
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,850
Yun Seo's making kimchi, too.

414
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,980
Leave her be. Maybe she feels like making kimchi.

415
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,610
Why is she working all day?

416
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,740
Hey, Yi Rae.

417
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,430
Yun Seo is even cleaning.

418
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:32,500
Let her be. That's how she's going to get over it.

419
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,510
Get over it? What?

420
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,360
Whenever she's going through something, she tires herself out to distract herself.

421
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,550
Is that what she does?

422
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,790
But why? If things are tough, just cry it out.

423
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,760
I've never seen Ha Yun Seo cry.

424
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,330
So just leave her be. Let her get it out somehow.

425
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's go inside.

426
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,100
- Is your mind a little clearer? 
 - What?

427
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,800
Aren't you tiring yourself out to distract yourself from something?

428
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,480
Ha Yun Seo.

429
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,920
I've been thinking...

430
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,820
What about you have a baby first?

431
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,290
- What are you saying? 
 - You're struggling to break up with Ju Won.

432
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,780
If you have a baby,

433
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,600
she can't be against it.

434
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,040
Yi Rae.

435
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,820
Actually...

436
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I've never had a warm family.

437
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,570
So...

438
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,560
I wanted the family I make to be truly warm.

439
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,010
But I can't dream of having a family like that

440
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,690
and have Ju Won turn his back on his parents because of me.

441
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,310
Ju Won's happiness...

442
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,920
might be shattered because of me.

443
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,940
I'm afraid of that, too.

444
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,270
What? Is it Ju Won?

445
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,420
No, it's Ji Seok's homeroom teacher.

446
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,140
At this hour?

447
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,450
Yes, Teacher.

448
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,360
 So... 

449
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,010
our kids took money from your son a couple of times?

450
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:26,580
We can return the money and apologize. Is this really necessary?

451
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,490
I know.

452
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:33,760
Boys can be boys. A campus violence disciplinary hearing over that?

453
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
Ma'am, there's only a month left until the collegiate exam.

454
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,010
Let's just play nice and settle.

455
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,050
They're high school seniors.

456
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,500
Mom...

457
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,930
   

458
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,760
Do you...

459
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:11,200
Do you know how much I wanted to die after seeing this?

460
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,960
If this happened to your sons, would you just let it go?

461
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,340
Because they're seniors?

462
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,430
So what?

463
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,970
I can't let this go.

464
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,350
The ones who did this to my son will be punished!

465
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,220
Here, here. Calm down.

466
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,910
We'll return the money and pay the medical bills. If you want,

467
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,220
we can offer a settlement as well. That works, right?

468
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,950
Of course, if we can avoid a school violence disciplinary hearing.

469
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:45,170
But, Teacher, a hearing will affect their college admissions, right?

470
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,880
You people...

471
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,390
Excuse me.

472
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,190
But Ji Seok didn't do it.

473
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,920
Ji Seok and Seok Hyeon never touched that bast...

474
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,890
I mean,

475
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,920
they never beat up Han Yeong Su.

476
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,890
Teacher, you heard, right? Not my kid.

477
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,440
Ma'am.

478
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,130
I'm sorry. It's my fault for not teaching him properly.

479
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,410
I'm truly sorry.

480
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,680
Nuna, I didn't do it.

481
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,480
I never took his money. I never hit him.

482
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,660
So?

483
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,770
You really didn't know Yeong Su was getting bullied by your friends?

484
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,560
- What? 
 - If you had stopped it,

485
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,020
this might not have happened to Yeong Su.

486
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,850
But you ignored it.

487
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,390
You turned his back on him, whether he got beaten up or not.

488
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,070
I didn't teach him properly.

489
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,300
I'm sorry.

490
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,290
If you're trying to change my mind,

491
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,140
it won't work.

492
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,180
I'm not trying to change your mind.

493
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,610
Hold the hearing.

494
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,970
Excuse me.

495
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,810
What are you doing? You haven't discussed this with us.

496
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,390
Whatever punishment he gets, I won't say anything.

497
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,470
Excuse me, Miss!

498
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,310
Are you really okay with that?

499
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,950
If he gets suspended, it'll stay on his record forever.

500
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,540
He'll have to live with that.

501
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,500
Forever.

502
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,060
When you said Ji Seok and Seok Hyeon didn't do it,

503
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,330
was that out of loyalty?

504
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,440
What?

505
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,900
Are you trying to be loyal in your own way?

506
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,340
Because you feel like they're being dragged down with you?

507
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,300
Because you feel sorry?

508
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,300
Yes. It's not fair.

509
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,810
Right.

510
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,110
I guess that's your loyalty.

511
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,100
What a ridiculous form of loyalty that is.

512
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,940
 Eat and shit... 

513
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,010
 Eat and shit... 

514
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,720
 Hey! 

515
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,960
 Get out. 

516
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,260
 Get out, you bastard! 

517
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,880
 What did I just say? 

518
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,770
 Why don't you listen to me? 

519
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,060
 Why don't you listen? 

520
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,270
 You... 

521
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,090
 Hey, hey, move... 

522
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,700
 Get up! 

523
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
 Geez... 

524
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,670
 Back then, 

525
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,490
 I was able to endure it because of you. 

526
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,500
   

527
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,000
   

528
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,600
 Ji Seok, wake up. 

529
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,780
 Why, Nuna? 

530
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,730
 Put this on. 

531
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,160
 Getting you out of that horrible house 

532
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,510
 is one of the best things I've ever done. 

533
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,700
 What? 

534
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,200
 Nuna, thank you... 

535
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
 for taking me with you. 

536
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,760
 Let's go. 

537
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,750
 Your small hand was so warm. 

538
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,200
 No matter how tough things got, I was able to endure it. 

539
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,970
Nuna.

540
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,460
If you want to say something, say it.

541
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,330
You can get angry, cuss, or hit me so...

542
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,350
just don't ignore me like that.

543
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,240
What did you think...

544
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,020
while watching him get bullied?

545
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,950
Did you really not think of anything?

546
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:33,300
You know how miserable it is to have someone walk all over you with force.

547
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,080
So how could you do that?

548
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,420
Nuna, I'm sorry.

549
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,230
I'm sorry.

550
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,320
 Once when I was young, 

551
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,220
 I ran away after being beaten up over and over again. 

552
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,800
 Help me! 

553
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,290
 Yun Seo! 

554
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,740
 Damn it. 

555
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,310
 Stop right there! 

556
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,490
 Save me! 

557
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,200
 I screamed, save me. 

558
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,020
 Help me. 

559
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,630
 Hey! Watch where you're going! 

560
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,680
 Yun Seo! 

561
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,750
 If I catch you, I'm really going to... Come here! 

562
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,590
 Come here! 

563
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,860
 Damn it... 

564
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,270
 Come here! 

565
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,100
 Get over here! 

566
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,400
 - Dad! 
 - Go on your way! 

567
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,900
 But no one offered to help. 

568
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,770
 Not one person out of all those people. 

569
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,720
 Shut up! 

570
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,630
 Save me! 

571
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,080
 Help me! 

572
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,450
I still can't forget the backs of the people who turned their gaze.

573
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,020
If those guys were stronger than you,

574
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,370
if you were afraid and avoided them,

575
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,580
I could understand.

576
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,490
But that wasn't why.

577
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,330
You could've...

578
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,410
stopped your friends.

579
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,400
I feel like...

580
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,590
I wasn't fully responsible for you.

581
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,560
It hurts so much.

582
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,600
 Dating? It was never that important. 

583
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,940
Have a drink.

584
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:56,270
You can get drunk in front of your brother.

585
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,760
The strongest liquor on days like today.

586
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,070
- Hyeong. 
 - Yes?

587
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,130
Why did she do that?

588
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,340
What?

589
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,270
Mother.

590
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,320
She can be cold, but she always makes the right call.

591
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,210
I always looked up to her.

592
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,380
I never thought she could be so rude.

593
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,200
I tried to understand.

594
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,760
Going out of line to meet with Yun Seo...

595
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,280
I tried to understand it.

596
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,890
Ju Won.

597
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,240
I once liked someone as much as you like her.

598
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,290
She was a hubae from college.

599
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,150
I was crazy about her and chased after her.

600
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,690
She wasn't from a bad family, either.

601
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,090
Her dad ran a medium-sized company.

602
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:07,510
She grew up comfortably in a well-off family.

603
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,160
But Mother was against it.

604
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,410
At first, the Mother being against it felt like the struggle of love.

605
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,990
As if we were Romeo and Juliet.

606
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,300
It made us feel like we couldn't live without one another.

607
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,900
So why did you break up?

608
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,560
She told me that...

609
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,580
it was hard to be with me.

610
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,660
Being with me made her more miserable by the day

611
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,870
and turned her into a pitiful person.

612
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:50,520
She asked me to please let her go.

613
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,600
Seeing you these days reminds me of myself from those days.

614
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,980
That's why I'm giving you advice, butting my nose in.

615
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,230
But Ju Won.

616
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,740
Think carefully about which way

617
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,280
is best for Yun Seo.

618
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,790
 Ever since she told me we should break up, 

619
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:31,870
 I've been thinking about how to hang onto Yun Seo. 

620
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:33,830
 Yun Seo. 

621
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,020
 Wait. 

622
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,160
 I was determined. 

623
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,610
 Will you really break up with me? 

624
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,240
 I pretended like I didn't hear her. 

625
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,200
 Like I didn't understand. 

626
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,280
 I held onto her. 

627
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,900
 And I wasn't considerate of her in any of that. 

628
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,890
   

629
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,080
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

630
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,460
There's something I need to say to you tonight.

631
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,930
Actually, I came to say something, too.

632
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,570
No.

633
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,770
I'll go first.

634
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm sorry I've been sending you mixed signals.

635
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,920
Honestly, it's been confusing.

636
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,700
It was a sudden breakup

637
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,860
and not because we don't like each other.

638
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,320
I didn't know what to do.

639
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,360
It's true that I was...

640
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,800
confused.

641
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,840
But...

642
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,840
I won't be confused anymore.

643
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,700
There's a lot I need to protect besides love.

644
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:41,900
I'm sorry I told you we should break up and then dragged it out.

645
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,780
I think...

646
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,230
this should be the end for us.

647
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,500
Let's...

648
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,600
be done.

649
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,400
What are you doing tomorrow?

650
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,730
- Tomorrow? 
 - Want to hang out with me tomorrow?

651
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,750
- What? 
 - Having meals together...

652
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,160
I'll cancel all that.

653
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,420
So let's hang out.

654
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,060
We don't need to break up right here and be all sad.

655
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,310
Let's laugh a lot and hang out.

656
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,610
Have a fun day.

657
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,880
I want to spend one last day with you.

658
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,530
Can't we?

659
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:50,820
♫  When I look at it, follow it, it's always shining  ♫

660
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:57,280
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫

661
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,960
Okay.

662
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,210
Let's do that.

663
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,480
You want to break up here?

664
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,650
Isn't it a bit too full of hopes and dreams for that?

665
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,860
Then where's a good breakup spot?

666
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,710
A park? A cafe?

667
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,860
Or in front of your house?

668
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,410
We've gone through so much.

669
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,600
Let's have tons of fun today. Okay?

670
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,230
You've heard of "bang for your buck," right?

671
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,780
"Bang for your buck"?

672
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:38,150
Going all out so you don't think about what you paid.

673
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,860
I know what it means, but...

674
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,320
Do chaebols use that phrase, too?

675
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,750
Of course.

676
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,050
Today, I'll show you that the rich are the greediest.

677
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,940
All day passes. Bang for our bucks.

678
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,740
Then we will proceed with the contract process.

679
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,170
Let's meet next week for the contract signing.

680
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,450
Good. We look forward to a successful collaboration with you. See you soon.

681
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,100
Thank you.

682
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,790
Hurray! Workday done!

683
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,460
Workday done, done.

684
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,080
Sebastian, are you ready?

685
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:37,110
What? Did he run this while he was drunk?

686
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,220
Ju Won, what a good boy.

687
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,590
Let's clean up now.

688
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,750
What?

689
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,140
Did I clean up yesterday?

690
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,390
That's impossible...

691
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,690
Wait a minute.

692
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,590
 Did we have this at home? When did I get this? 

693
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,820
What the heck? What's wrong with me?

694
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,980
Wait.

695
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,420
Alcohol-related dementia?

696
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,950
T-The hospital.

697
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,410
No.

698
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:24,360
If anyone finds out...

699
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,720
our stock prices will plunge.

700
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,610
What do I do?

701
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:31,430
 Husband! 

702
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,000
Why is it so hard to see you around here?

703
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,010
Good to see you, Husband.

704
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,670
You've gotten a lot freer since I last saw you.

705
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,100
The house...

706
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,000
your looks...

707
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,780
You wanted a bang for your buck.

708
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,550
- Just Merry-go-round? 
 - Yes.

709
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:29,120
I don't like the super scary ones. You don't like this?

710
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,200
It's not that I don't like it.

711
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,730
A merry-go-round feels like it costs less money to make.

712
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,830
- What? 
 - To get a bang for your buck,

713
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,270
we need expensive rides.

714
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,150
Something big, grand,

715
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,360
one that looks like it costs a lot of money to install and operate.

716
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:48,720
Something like that will make your money feel worth it.

717
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,960
Very practical.

718
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,810
Right? I know.

719
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,500
Rich people don't get what "bang for your buck" truly means.

720
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,000
- Re-learn it from me today. 
 - Okay.

721
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,350
- Are you having fun? 
 - Yes.

722
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:20,810
♫  I sleep without sleeping  ♫

723
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:25,320
♫  I dream without dreaming  ♫

724
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,690
♫  When the sleepless dawn comes  ♫

725

♫  I still call your name  ♫

726

♫  Sweet drama, I live for you  ♫

727

♫  Even if you push me away, you're the only one for me  ♫

730
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:16,350
♫  Sweet drama  ♫

731
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,960
It looks like you're enjoying that.

732
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,980
I'm getting the bang for my buck.

733
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,920
The operation costs must be crazy because of the labor, right?

734
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,540
Well, all the princesses are out here.

735
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,140
Did you like princesses when you were young?

736
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,730
No way.

737
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,750
Princesses put strange fantasies in little kids' heads.

738
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,350
Strange fantasies?

739
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:59,150
The fantasy that a prince on a white horse will come and rescue you when things are hard.

740
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,310
Shall we go?

741
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:22,260
♫  If you were I, what would you do?  ♫

742
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:31,630
♫  Then try to see where I'm in  ♫

743
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:42,490
♫  Countless distance between us  ♫

744
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:52,720
♫  Ain't no pressure anyway  ♫

745
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,350
♫  I keep looking at you  ♫

746
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:02,650
♫  You're catching my eyes (The stars in my eyes)  ♫

747
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:10,400
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

748
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,500
 We didn't take a single photo that day. 

749
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,600
 Maybe we couldn't dare to remember our last moments together. 

750
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,500
 Our ending was going down like the sun. 

751
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:35,600
♫  I'll become your land  ♫

752
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,300
♫  I'll become solid, if you don't mind  ♫

753
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,870
Mommy! Daddy!

754
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:49,180
Mommy... Daddy...

755
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,580
Mommy!

756
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:54,400
Daddy!

757
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,030
Mommy!

758
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,980
Don't cry.

759
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,330
Did you lose your mom and dad?

760
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,380
Let me find them.

761
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,310
Do you remember where you last saw them?

762
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,690
Prince...

763
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,080
- Hyo Jin! 
 - Mommy!

764
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,100
Oh, no...

765
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,350
- Where were you? 
 - Thank you.

766
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,970
- No problem. 
 - Thank you.

767
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,840
Bye.

768
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,100
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

769
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,800
Let's go. Thank you.

770
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:56,960


771
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,300
Did you hear?

772
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,380
She called me a prince.

773
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,510
I didn't hear that.

774
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,860
Are you sure?

775
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:09,650
Yes, she definitely called me a prince.

776
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:14,780
She was super scared after losing her parents. She seemed grateful I helped her.

777
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,310
See?

778
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:23,020
A prince isn't always a bad thing.

779
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,900
I know you don't need a prince.

780
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,530
You're capable of getting through a tough situation on your own.

781
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:37,690
But...

782
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,300
on a tough day,

783
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:47,640
you might need someone to lean on.

784
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,740
And I wanted to be that person.

785
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,460
I wanted to make you the happiest person.

786
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,120
I'm sorry I made things the hardest for you.

787
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:15,020
♫  One less spark clouds in your eyes  ♫

788
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:23,060
♫  Please don't go alone  ♫

789
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,530
The day is almost over.

790
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,630
It's been so long since you've smiled at me.

791
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:34,150
It was such a magical and happy time together.

792
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,470
♫  Fading you  ♫

793
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:41,600
It's time for the spell to lift.

794
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:46,650
Letting you go...

795
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,710
is the right thing to do, right?

796
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,040
♫  Everything might just disappear  ♫

797
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:06,940
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

798
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,880
Really?

799
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:27,000
♫  Every breath, every word, hold on tight, a lonely struggle  ♫

800
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,930
♫  Always  ♫

801
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:37,970
♫  Shining you  ♫

802
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:46,500

803
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:53,980

♫  Stay deep in my heart  ♫

805
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:04,300
 The stars were shining, the fireworks were going off. 

806
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,860
 Bubbles were flying. 

807
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,970
♫  Every moment we'll go through  ♫

808

♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

809
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,120
 We were the only two people who weren't happy there that night. 

810
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:25,940
♫  Shining you  ♫

811
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:34,480
♫  Shining you, like a starlight  ♫

812
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,060
♫  When I look at it  ♫

813
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,770
   

814
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:42,630
   

815
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:46,350
 These are clearly ex-boyfriend lines. 

816
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,290
 We said we'd break up. This is wrong, no? 

817
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,370
   

818
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:54,650
 Those desperate phrases won't leave my head. 

819
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:58,000
 "Yun Seo's cell phone"? Team Leader, have you been in this car before? 

820
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,450
 - Honey, have some. 
 - Honey? 

821
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:04,310
 Every time I get a text from you, 

822
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:07,100
 my heart drops! 

823
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,790
 Yun Seo. 

824
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,140
 I left everything behind. 

825
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:19,160
♫  I'm lost and wandering  ♫

826
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,340
♫  You shine with all your strength  ♫

827
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:31,870
♫  See the thunder striking, the huge waves  ♫

828
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,150
♫  Under the red sunset  ♫

829
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:42,070
♫  I get ready to face the night  ♫

830
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:46,620
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

831
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,080
♫  You shine so far away  ♫

832
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,030
♫  If I reach out my hands, I can almost touch it  ♫

833
01:04:55,030 --> 01:05:01,490
♫  But I still have a way to go  ♫

834
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:12,980
♫  Night after night, I've been waiting for today  ♫

835
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:17,700
♫  Sailing to you, through the darkness  ♫

836
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:24,580
♫  I'm ready to face you now  ♫

837
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:30,890
♫  Night after night, I've been waiting for today  ♫

838
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:35,730
♫  Sailing to you, through the darkness  ♫

839
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:42,650
♫  I'm ready to face you now  ♫

840
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:49,460
♫  You're my only one shining star  ♫

841
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:53,970
♫  You're looking at me from far away  ♫

842
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,850
♫  My journey to you  ♫

843
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,930
♫  I see the end  ♫

844
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:07,400
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

845
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,970
♫  You're dazzling in front of me  ♫

846
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:15,840
♫  I can't forget this moment  ♫

847
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,900
♫  You are the whole new paradise  ♫

848
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,390
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

849
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,910
♫  You're dazzling in front of me  ♫

850
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:33,810
♫  I can't forget this moment  ♫

851
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:40,650
♫  You are the whole new paradise  ♫
