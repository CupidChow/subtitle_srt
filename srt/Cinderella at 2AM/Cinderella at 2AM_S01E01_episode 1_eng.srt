1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,420
   

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:11,070


3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,660
   

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,440
   

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,050
   

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,450
   

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,080
   

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,850
Yes, I understand.

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,690
I will break up with Ju Won.

10
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,140
 My boyfriend, who I've been with for one and a half years, 

11
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,610
 was the youngest son of my company's largest shareholder. 

12
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,090
I'm glad we're on the same page.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,760
 I guess that's how they pay these days. 

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,480
  ­ 

15
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,200
   

16
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,370
Thank you.

17
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,180
Honestly, I was concerned there would be raised voices.

18
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,880
Thank goodness we speak the same language, Ha Yun Seo.

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,190
Don't mention it. Thank you for treating me to dinner at such a nice place

20
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,960
and waiting until we were done eating to bring it up.

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,350
So when can you break up with him?

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,650
- I may need a little time for that. 
 - Why?

23
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,150
We've been so good together until now.

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,320
If I break up with him all of a sudden, what would Ju Won think?

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,910
He's already been distressed ever since I found out that he's your son.

26
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,430
If I break up with him now?

27
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,880
He will find out that you visited me, which will put you on the spot.

28
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,210
So?

29
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,450
How do you want to handle this?

30
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,450
I'll make him get sick of me slowly, on his own.

31
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,130
It looks better if we break up because of our differences.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,700
It'll also help Ju Won have fewer regrets.

33
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,530
I will end it within two months.

34
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,980
Yun Seo, you seem so honest.

35
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,020
Let me ask you an honest question as well.

36
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,870
Did you really...

37
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,920
not know he was my son?

38
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,720
Did you ever...

39
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,820
have feelings for my Ju Won?

40
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,680
 Team Leader. 

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,210
♫  Fade in you  ♫

42
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,810
Team Leader Ha Yun Seo,

43
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,620
are you headed home right now?

44
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,650
♫  It's like a fog  ♫

45
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:55,100
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, you might disappear  ♫

46
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:04,330
♫   So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

47
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,010
I liked...

48
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,610
Ju Won very much.

49
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,710
But if our differences are this big,

50
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,710
I don't think I can handle it.

51
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,370
Please don't worry. I know my place.

52
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,270
I wouldn't refuse your money because of my pride.

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,430
Within two months,

54
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,750
I will completely break up with Ju Won.

55
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,760
 Midnight. 

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,880
 What was on Cinderella's mind when the spell went away? 

57
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,280
 At first, it must have felt surreal to go to the ball. 

58
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,120
 She probably lost sleep, excited about meeting the prince. 

59
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,680
 But how about after 2 a.m.? 

60
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,050
 Was she still excited? 

61
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,000
 I don't want to be in a relationship that claws at my pride and hurts my feelings. 

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,900
 Goodbye, Seo Ju Won. 

63
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,930
   

64
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,500
   

65
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,070
What? You're breaking up with him?

66
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,600
Hey.

67
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,110
Are you and Seo Ju Won going to split up like these chopsticks?

68
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,900
Yes. That's my plan.

69
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,090
So you and Seo Ju Won are going to be sliced

70
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,440
like this piece of tofu?

71
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,070
That's what I said many times, Uncle.

72
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,000
I just can't believe it! You've been so good together until now!

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,030
So why do you want to break up all of a sudden?

74
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,970
Ju Won is AL Group's youngest.

75
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,260
I know he's the youngest on your team. I'm sure everyone loves him for it.

76
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,220
No. My company. AL Group.

77
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,280
He's the son of our chairwoman.

78
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,010
- A third-generation chaebol* heir.
- What?
 (*Mega-conglomerate) 

79
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,680
The youngest son of a chaebol family? Since when?

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,300
Since he was born, I guess?

81
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,890
No, I mean, when did you find out?

82
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,830
About a month ago?

83
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,480
 I never could have imagined 

84
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,690
 that he was the Chairwoman's son. 
   

85
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,230
Hello! I'm the new employee, Seo Ju Won. Looking forward to working with you.

86
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,570
Okay! Looking forward to working with you, too!

87
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,550
Everyone, applaud!

88
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,940
Sit over there. Sit, sit.

89
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,330
Wow! You're so handsome!

90
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,260
You look like me when I was younger.

91
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,300
 I heard chaebols were a meritocracy too these days, but no one on my team 

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,800
 imagined that our youngest would be the son of the Chairwoman. 

93
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,240
 I still didn't know while we were dating. 

94
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,930
 Since he started the relationship under false pretenses, 

95
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,560
 Ju Won probably missed the timing to tell me. 

96
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,200
I don't want to say bye.

97
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,670
Should I take you home?

98
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,780
No.

99
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,350
It's okay. You must be tired.

100
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,540
You always take me home.

101
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,550
Why don't you let me do the same?

102
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,880
Well...

103
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,600
 When I think about it, 

104
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,540
 I could have figured it out. 

105
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,370
- Ta-da! 
 - What is this?

106
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,200
I thought it might look good on you.

107
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,000
You did.

108
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,730
- You thought this might look good on me. 
 - Yes.

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,250
I look even better returning it.

110
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,690
Let's go return it.

111
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,510
- R-Return? Why? 
 - Give me the bag.

112
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,590
- No. 
 - Where's the receipt?

113
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,690
- I don't have it. 
  - When he gave me an expensive bag for our 1-year anniversary, 

114
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,720
 I should have known. 

115
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,990
 His family is so rich that a bag like that is no problem. 

116
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,210
 But I didn't know then. 

117
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,100
 - Then last month...  
 - Yes.

118
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,480
   

119
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay.

120
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,140
Come up with me.

121
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,510
I have some whisky in my office that I got as a gift. Let's have a drink.

122
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,020
   

123
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,140
   

124
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,700
   

125
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,910
With the Vice Chairman? Why?

126
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,080
It's okay.

127
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,050
Let's not get together at work, Hyeong.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,970
 Hyeong? 

129
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,740
What's on your suit? So clumsy for a Vice Chairman.

130
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,620
Who is calling who clumsy?

131
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,090
Don't you remember I used to carry around tissues for your runny nose when you were little?

132
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,440
Should we ask our mom?

133
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,420
The Chairwoman is busy. You're just an employee.

134
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,110
 What is this situation? 

135
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,510
 If the Chairwoman's son is the Vice Chairman, 

136
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,120
 and if the Vice Chairman's brother is Seo Ju Won? 

137
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
   
   

138
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,700
Anyway, come upstairs if you change your mind. Bye.

139
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,760
Hey, hey!

140
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
Seo Ju Won!

141
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,530
Wait, I-I...

142
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,680
How long have you been there?

143
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,090
For real?

144
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,090
Are you from a rich family?

145
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,270
Honey, that's not...

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,930
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,870
And all this time

148
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,220
you let me pay for meals?

149
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,290
What?

150
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,220
Is that what you're upset about?

151
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,610
 Daebak. So... 

152
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,220
the Seo Ju Won who used to drink makgeolli

153
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,080
with you over here is AL Group's youngest son?

154
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,890
This phone. This card.

155
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,140
The youngest son of the chaebol family that makes credit cards?

156
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,370
Wait, so if you found out a month ago and have been fine,

157
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,690
why did you decide to break up with him today?

158
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,900
 Boss! 

159
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,500
Hey, they're calling for the boss. Go.

160
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,080
You go, Uncle. An employee should move fast. Now!

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,670
I want to keep listening to Yun Seo!

162
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,330
So? Why did you decide to break up with him today?

163
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,300
I can't imagine his mother handing you a cash envelope like in dramas.

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,380
Yes. She handed me a piece of paper for me to write down my account number.

165
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,020
What? That's how they do it these days?

166
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,470
- So? Did you write it down? 
 - Yes, I did.

167
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,640
- For real? 
 - For real.

168
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,200
- What? 
 - What?

169
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,410
I mean, are you the type to take money from your boyfriend's mother?

170
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,530
What's your actual reason?

171
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,150
I want to help with Ji Seok's tuition.

172
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,460
Who do you think you're fooling?

173
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,510
In college, you worked part-time to pay your tuition without buying a cup of coffee.

174
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,560
After you got a job, you saved up for five years, not buying clothes, living in squalor.

175
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,470
Do you think I don't know you already have Ji Seok's tuition?

176
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,600
Why did you take the money?

177
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,040
I thought the money would make the breakup easier.

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,330
And I'm telling you because I'm afraid I won't be able to break up

179
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,770
with him after taking the money.

180
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,530
Every time you quit smoking, you tell me.

181
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,340
Because telling everyone is a way to keep a promise

182
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,630
because you know people are keeping an eye on you.

183
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,880
That's why I'm telling you.

184
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,100
It's a promise I have to keep by all means.

185
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,450
You have to keep seeing him even after the breakup.

186
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,600
What will you do?

187
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,230
She said not to worry about that.

188
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,720
If I break up with him, she'll transfer him abroad.

189
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,380
That might be a better opportunity for Ju Won, anyway.

190
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,930
I don't have an appetite. I'll see you later.

191
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,190
Next time I'm here, I'll be single. Make a lot of makgeolli for me.

192
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,030
Bye.

193
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,700
Hey, Yun Seo...

194
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,450
Bye.

195
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,870
Ha Yun Seo.

196
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,730
What is she going to do?

197
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,040
   

198
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,170
 The person you are calling is not available... 

199
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,540
Isn't it strange?

200
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,940
It is.

201
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,640
Really?

202
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,090
Where?

203
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,360
Everything.

204
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
That can't be.

205
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,960
The best master tailor in Korea used the best fabric

206
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,950
to create a one-of-a-kind custom suit for my body.

207
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,650
How could the combo of this look and my body be strange?

208
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,710
Were we talking about you?

209
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,050
What were you talking about?

210
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,750
Me? Yun Seo.

211
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,230
Yun Seo isn't answering my phone calls.

212
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,130
Talking about Yun Seo again? Stop it.

213
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,220
She probably has days when she doesn't want to talk. Just look at me.

214
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,190
My wife and I only check if the other one's alive.

215
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,120
Good for you. Hey, be good to your wife.

216
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,830
Not contacting her is being good to her.

217
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,180
She has no interest in me, either.

218
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:36,280
You don't get it, but sometimes a marriage is about business, family to family.

219
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,110
She's alone in Paris. Aren't you worried about her?

220
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,720
That's why I check up on her on social media occasionally.

221
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,010
I keep up with her daily routine.

222
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,910
Lee Mi Jin.

223
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,070
   

224
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,000
Are you allowed to use social media?

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,490
Weren't you banned after your crying selfie drove everyone berserk?

226
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,950
    

227
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,960
   

228
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,880
Hey. That was a long time ago.

229
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,520
Also, I only use this account to lurk.

230
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,690
But speaking of,

231
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,110
the secretaries forbade me from using social media, but they let my wife do it.

232
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,460
Look at this.

233
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,530
She constantly posts her food and outfits, but they do nothing.

234
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:25,340
I think it's because everything she eats, wears, and posts leads to higher sales.

235
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,810
What do you think?

236
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,220
Who am I talking to right now?

237
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,370
Come on, man.

238
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,730
Anyway, I'm trying on the next one.

239
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,950
I know it'll look good, but...

240
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,560
look at me.

241
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,340
 I'm tired. See you later. 

242
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,490
   

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,170
 Break up within two months. 

244
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,440
 No matter what. 

245
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,500
Make him get sick of me slowly, on his own. Yes.

246
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,540
But how?

247
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,990
Team Leader, how was your weekend?

248
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,400
I missed you.

249
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,960
Me, too.

250
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,300
I will go on ahead.

251
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,520
This isn't it.

252
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,360
How can I make him get sick of me?

253
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,070
 How to lose a boyfriend. 

254
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,970
 ­  

255
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,540
Borrow money?

256
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,340
"There is no worse lover than one who borrows money from you."

257
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,450
"Start with a small amount first, then..."

258
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,500
 Ju Won. 

259
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,310
 Could I... 

260
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,850
 borrow some money? 

261
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,610
 How much? 

262
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,920
 How much can you lend me? 

263
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,400
 Just tell me how much. 

264
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,200
 With all due respect, I'm a chaebol. 

265
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,790
I mean, would money be a big deal to a chaebol?

266
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,690
Or...

267
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,170
"Show him your rough side"?

268
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,620
 Look at this f***er. 

269
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,520
 F***! 

270
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,790
 Son of a bitch, you're dead to me. 

271
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,380
 Honey, what's wrong? Just let it go. 

272
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,310
 Hold onto your seat belt. 

273
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,820
 Wait, slow down! 

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,530
 Honey... 

275
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,920
That's too out of left field.

276
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,880
Is there anything better?

277
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,000
 ­  

278
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,240
 Have a permanent frown on your face. 

279
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,030
 Looking like this all day is definitely unlikable. 

280
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,260
This is my default face from now on.

281
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,870
- Good morning. 
 - Hello.

282
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,180
Aigoo, that looks so heavy!

283
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,760
This is for you, Deputy.

284
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,750
- This is for you, Seonbaenim. 
 - Thank you!

285
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,450
I could have done it. Why did you do it?

286
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,060
You told me to go to the first floor, get coffee, and pick up packages.

287
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,470
Too hot!

288
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,530
Ju Won...

289
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,760
I told you to use two sleeves. It's hot.

290
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,450
You are so slow at learning the ropes. This is AL Group!

291
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,820
If you struggled to get hired, you should be working hard.

292
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,490
If you can't even do basic things right, how will you get to the next level?

293
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,370
You'll get the hang of it.

294
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,970
Daebak! Isn't this so cute?

295
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,050
It's a stone, but you take care of it like it's a pet.

296
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,160
I got these for my blood circulation.

297
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,170
My friend's company has massage chairs on every floor,

298
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,180
but we don't have it here.

299
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,200
I will let these help with my blood circulation.

300
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,180
Blood circulation...

301
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,630
I'll refrain from ordering packages to work from now on.

302
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,940
She's acting strange today.

303
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,270
You saw, right? Ha Yun Seo's face just...

304
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,920
He's our hubae.

305
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,240
Is it so wrong to give him some advice on adulting?

306
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,370
Ha Yun Seo is my age.

307
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,180
But she's the team leader, and I'm the deputy.

308
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,630
She probably doesn't think I have the right.

309
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,130
That's a leap, but she seems to be in a bad mood.

310
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,910
I had way fewer packages than I usually do.

311
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,170
But she was totally staring at me.

312
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,530
I was so uncomfortable I almost quit my job.

313
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,150
Let's go. If we're gone too long, she'll give us another stink eye.

314
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,640
Let's go.

315
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,300
Anyway, don't our company benefits suck?

316
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,900
The employees' lounge has nothing but green tea.

317
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,780
Other companies have Lev-Daaz or some expensive ice cream these days.

318
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,320
Anyway, the higher-ups only care about themselves.

319
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,940
Isn't that right?

320
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,580
Yes, well...

321
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,060
- We were just replenishing the green tea. 
 - Okay.

322
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,300
 At the risk of becoming a boomer boss. 

323
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,440
I can't accept this.

324
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,430
- Honey. 
 - Yes.

325
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,350
 Right. Let's do it outside of work. 

326
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,570
 I will pick a fight with everything. 

327
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,850
Hold on. Let me order some coffee.

328
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,970
I'm hungry.

329
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,880
Should we go eat, then? What are you craving?

330
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,270
- I don't know. 
 - What?

331
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,180
I said I don't know.

332
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,660
"You don't know"?

333
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,530
You normally...

334
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,180
 Let's go with pasta today. 

335
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,730
 Kalguksu.* 
 (*Korean knife-cut noodles)  

336
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,490
 Let's hit all the bakeries today. 

337
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,440
You're usually a bossy lady about this.

338
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,000
- Should we get some pasta? 
 - I feel queasy.

339
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,050
- How about spicy kalguksu? 
 - That place is too spicy.

340
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,570
Right. I thought you liked spicy.

341
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,500
Not today.

342
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,600
Right. Not today. Then...

343
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,560
I don't want it.

344
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,950
I haven't even said it.

345
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,060
Then what about...

346
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,250
a drink?

347
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,590
No. I said I wanted to eat.

348
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,240
This is so annoying.

349
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,350
 I feel so awkward trying to put on an act. 

350
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,550
Let's get out of here.

351
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,590
What? Get out where? We need to make a decision.

352
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,550
What?

353
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,490
Go where?

354
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,120
- Let's go. 
 - Come on...

355
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,320
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

356
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,530
See?

357
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,030
You always like this place. I knew you'd like it.

358
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,160
I didn't really want to come here today.

359
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,970
Well, we're here so I'll eat it.

360
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,040
By the way, is something going on?

361
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,420
You've been acting a bit strange since yesterday.

362
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,160
Did Ji Seok...

363
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,790
What about Ji Seok?

364
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,000
Are you asking if Ji Seok got in trouble again?

365
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,330
No, not that–

366
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,390
What do you mean? Do you think all he does is get in trouble?

367
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,900
Why are you treating my brother like a bad kid?

368
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I assumed things about Ji Seok.

369
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,140
But...

370
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,510
why do I feel like you're trying to make me angry on purpose?

371
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,990
What did I do?

372
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm going to the restroom.

373
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,000
 I'm the worst. 

374
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,180
 Make him get sick of me slowly, on his own. 

375
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,840
 I thought it would be better for both of us if 

376
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,930
 Ju Won gets tired of me and leaves first. 

377
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:29,420
 Get angry, act distant, as if I'm losing interest, 

378
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,120
 then tell him that I have someone else. 

379
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,930
 He would be hurt but would want to break up. 

380
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,090
That was my plan.

381
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,840
Why doesn't he even know how to get angry?

382
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,380
It looks like your girlfriend is upset.

383
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,330
Did you do something bad?

384
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,900
I don't know.

385
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,720
She's scary when she's angry. You're scared, too, right?

386
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,800
Rather than being scared,

387
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,630
I think that even looks cute.

388
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,730
Aigoo.

389
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,610
 Ju Won... 

390
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,780
 How do I break up with you? 

391
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,670
Ha Yun Seo!

392
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,980
- Are you alone? 
 - Yes.

393
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,290
- I came alone. 
 - I mean, are you single?

394
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,110
You said you'd be single next time you were here.

395
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,600
I knew it.

396
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,010
You think it's easy to break up?

397
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,530
If everyone did what they said,

398
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,910
I would've quit smoking by now.

399
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,730
Hey, Yun Seo is here. Good.

400
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,840
Taste the new makgeolli I just made.

401
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,800
It's organic and made from 20 different grains.

402
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,790
Uncle, I'm not drinking for a while.

403
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,580
Why not? You've tested our makgeolli for the last ten years.

404
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,790
That's right! Even when a breakup is imminent, do your job.

405
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,550
- Right. 
 - Go inside.

406
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,090
I'll make you something delicious.

407
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,180
Uncle, where's the alcohol?

408
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,720
All the way inside.

409
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,910
Hey. She said she was breaking up with him last time.

410
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:28,790
Did they actually break up? Should we be giving her alcohol?

411
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,040
Yes. She needs to get drunk.

412
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,740
If not, she'll just pile it up inside and not let it out.

413
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,050
It drives me crazy to watch her.

414
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,220
- How many barrels did you make? 
 - Twenty.

415
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,200
Let her drink all of it tonight.

416
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,510
You offered, and she took it?

417
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,600
Yes.

418
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,140
Ha Yun Seo took the money?

419
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,360
That seems out of character.

420
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,850
It's for the best. It's clean.

421
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,590
Unlike someone else.

422
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,520
Are you and your wife doing well?

423
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,260
Of course. We talked for a while on my way here.

424
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,400
She had beef bourguignon today and said it was a downer.

425
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,490
She didn't even finish half of it.

426
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,790
See?

427
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,900
You went through a hard time back then, but you get along fine now.

428
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,300
There will come a day when Ju Won thanks me for it.

429
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,900
But Ha Yun Seo...

430
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,830
She's polite in her words and manners.

431
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,580
But when I listen to what she's saying,

432
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,130
she's ruthless.

433
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,150
I really don't know if she dated Ju Won for the money.

434
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,990
Why? Are you angry about it?

435
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,580
As you said, it's a clean cut, Mother.

436
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,010
She's piercing a nail through Ju Won's heart, too.

437
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,420
Anyway,

438
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,540
Ha Yun Seo took the money?

439
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,280
That's a plot twist.

440
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,300
 Just go see the Chairwoman again. 

441
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,220
Return her money. Cinderella? Do it!

442
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,170
Hey. Cinderella?

443
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,770
Do you think that's me?

444
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,860
A Cinderella who marries a prince? That doesn't exist in real life.

445
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,560
Only in fairytales.

446
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,980
So? Are you really going to break up with Ju Won?

447
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,280
- I have to. 
 - You can't.

448
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,160
You like him this much. How can you?

449
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,660
No. I totally can break up with him.

450
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,990
I am Ha Yun Seo the Ferocious.

451
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,760
Do you want me to show you how I cut people off?

452
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,450
- Show me! 
 - I'll show you.

453
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,920
What?

454
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,170
   

455
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:07,070
What are you doing? Send drunk texts?

456
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,010
That's the worst way to break up. Don't!

457
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,970
Give it back!

458
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,330
I'm already the worst. I even took the money!

459
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,230
Doing this slowly for two months.

460
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,300
I can't hurt him like this every day.

461
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,190
I'd rather hurt him a lot all at once.

462
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,330
For each other.

463
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,600
Hey!

464
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,780
Hey, Ha Yun Seo!

465
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,020
- Wake up! 
 - Ju Won...

466
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm sorry.

467
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,840
Oh, perfect.

468
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,240
Ha Yun Seo, wake up!

469
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,380
Wake up!

470
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,130
Are you feeling okay?

471
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,260
Why did you drink so much? What's going on?

472
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,570
Did you get into a fight with that blubbering weakling?

473
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,920
How dare you talk like that to an adult?

474
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,980
It's all for you, Nuna.

475
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,060
I told you I don't like that weakling.

476
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,130
The way he dresses is so shabby. He looks totally poor.

477
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,520
   

478
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,410
You got it just right.

479
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,950
Of course!

480
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,720
Only a man can truly evaluate another man.

481
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,290
He will make you suffer. Money is so important.

482
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,120
Love isn't everything these days.

483
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,170
Is that the weakling texting you this morning?

484
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,950
 Team Leader, what are you talking about? 

485
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,960
What?

486
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,290
  ­ 

487
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,360
 It's hopeless... break... 

488
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,970
   

489
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,860
 What are you doing? Sending drunk texts? 

490
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,320
 That's the worst way to break up. 

491
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,660
 - Don't! 
 - Give it back! 

492
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,410
What is this?

493
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,900
 It's hopeless... break... 

494
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,600
I must be crazy! Why did I text the group chat?

495
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,390
What's wrong with you this morning? You're scaring me!

496
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,940
You don't need to know.

497
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,220
 I tried to break up with him by text? 

498
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,090
 Was I that big of a jerk? 

499
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,580
 And on a group chat, too? 

500
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,320
   

501
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,660
 And what is this? 

502
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,040
 What did we talk about for over a minute? 

503
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,020
 I don't remember anything. 

504
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,100
- Excuse me. 
  - Going up. 

505
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,930
What are you doing over there?

506
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,720
Well...

507
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,970
We talked on the phone for a minute and 10 seconds last night.

508
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,130
I can't remember what we talked about.

509
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,640
Nothing much.

510
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,740
I saw your message on the group chat and called you, wondering what you meant.

511
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,340
We said good night, then hung up.

512
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,860
Who were you drinking so much with last night?

513
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,550
With Yi Rae.

514
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,980
Also, the message I wrote in the group chat...

515
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,010
- Team Leader! 
 - Hello.

516
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,430
- Good morning. 
 - Hello.

517
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,450
Oh, Team Leader. Why did you ignore my message?

518
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,650
What?

519
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,560
What were you trying to say in the group chat last night?

520
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
Well...

521
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,590
I was drunk and made a mistake.

522
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,530
Aigoo, it was a drunk text.

523
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,030
Let me see.

524
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,440
This one.

525
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,310
"It's hopeless."

526
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,370
"Break..."

527
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,270
Whose hair* was so bad? 
  (*In Korean, "break" sounds like "hair") 

528
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,290
What?

529
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,460
Hey, don't ask. You already know the answer.

530
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,760
I got this haircut at a barbershop in Gangnam!

531
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,650
She was definitely talking about Ju Won.

532
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,700
Ju Won, are you still getting the same 8,000 won haircut you got in high school?

533
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,670
You don't get why people spend money on haircuts, right?

534
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,760
Your hair doesn't have a soul.

535
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,050
Soul...

536
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:59,590
Team Leader. "It's hopeless... break..." You meant Deputy Bae, right?

537
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:05,120
It was Ju Won, right? Or Ye Yeong since she has flakes all over her dirty hair.

538
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,580
Tell us now! Why send a text like that and make us uneasy?

539
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,590
Who's hopeless? Who?

540
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,360
It was me!

541
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,470
My hair is hopeless.

542
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,530
So you knew.

543
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,760
I couldn't bring myself to say it.

544
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,900
We should all learn from her self-awareness.

545
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,660
Ms. Leah at the hair salon across the street is amazing.

546
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,710
Do you want to go there?

547
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:38,480
If you tell her I referred you, we both get 20% off.

548
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,900
Should I make an appointment for tonight?

549
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,470
Yes, make sure you go.

550
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,210
Yay, 20%!

551
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,740
- Ms. Leah! 
 - Yes.

552
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,560
- Please wait. 
 - Okay.

553
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,480
What am I doing here right now?

554
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,540
 Did Ju Won really buy this? 

555
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:27,870
   

556
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,250
 Team Leader, I'm working on the press release for tomorrow. 

557
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,820
 Could you send the proposed schedule file one more time? 

558
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,030
   

559
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,900
What?

560
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,140
That was yesterday.

561
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,140
 Nothing much. We said good night, then hung up. 

562
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,620
   

563
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,040
 Hi, Ju Won. 

564
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,000
 I don't think you meant to text that to the group. 

565
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,480
 Ju Won, we should stop seeing each other. 

566
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,570
 What? 

567
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,900
 Let's break up. 

568
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,490
 Let's talk in person. Where are you? 

569
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,330
 No. Don't come. 

570
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,530
 Even if you come, nothing will change. 

571
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,900
 We're going to break up. 

572
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,120
I ordered you a cup of hot tea.

573
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,140
After having that conversation last night,

574
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,340
why did you act like nothing happened?

575
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,350
I wanted to pretend like I didn't hear it.

576
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,740
Ju Won...

577
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,070
- Actually– 
 - I don't want to hear it.

578
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,910
You met my mother, didn't you?

579
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,420
What are you talking about?

580
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,760
I heard everything.

581
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,600
 - Did you just see Mother? 
 - Yes. 

582
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,580
 It's late. 

583
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,070
 Hyeong. 

584
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,030
 Yun Seo is acting strange. 

585
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,800
 - Really? 
 - She won't pick up my calls. 

586
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,600
 Her texts are one or two words. 

587
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,030
 Do you think I did something wrong? 

588
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,170
 Never mind. 

589
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,190
 I'll go inside. 

590
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,520
 Ju Won. 

591
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,920
 Yun Seo... 

592
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,060
 had dinner with Mother. 

593
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,970
Let me try to convince my mother.

594
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,530
That won't solve anything.

595
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,080
If you already heard from your brother, this will be quick.

596
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,100
Let's break up.

597
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,820
Let's break up, Ju Won.

598
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,120
First, let me apologize.

599
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,800
It was unpleasant, right?

600
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,270
It's not because of the chairwoman.

601
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,790
Fine.

602
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,900
It's true I decided to break up after meeting with the chairwoman.

603
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,730
But...

604
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,020
ever since I found out who you are,

605
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,320
I thought it might come to this eventually.

606
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,580
And it's now.

607
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,830
You thought about...

608
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,200
breaking up with me?

609
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,610
You told me that you wanted to marry me and be together for a long time.

610
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,370
That was–

611
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,300
That was before I knew who Seo Ju Won was, exactly.

612
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,300
 Once, that was the future I dreamt of. 

613
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:11,590
 He was the first person I liked with all my heart. 

614
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,990
Can we ignore our backgrounds?

615
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,530
Can you just see me as me?

616
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,870
Have you ever skipped a meal

617
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,870
because you couldn't afford the school lunch?

618
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,840
You've never worked part-time to pay tuition.

619
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:45,900
You've never worried about getting a job.

620
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,170
We're too different.

621
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,430
The chairwoman didn't do anything wrong.

622
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,020
Nothing good comes out of two people who are too different

623
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,370
staying together.

624
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,330
A knight in shining armor?

625
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,560
I'm turning him down.

626
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,400
I don't want to be in a world I'm not meant for and end up unhappy.

627
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,310
Stop it.

628
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,000
Why?

629
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,930
- You don't want to hear it? 
 - It's not that.

630
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,830
I'm fine. I'm fine, but...

631
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,200
why do you keep making yourself unhappy?

632
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,230
You're the one who's struggling the most saying it.

633
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,910
I'm sorry to put you in this situation. But could you reconsider–

634
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,540
No.

635
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,180
I've told you my decision.

636
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,890
Let's not do this.

637
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,600
Yun Seo.

638
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,420
Wait.

639
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,710
Let's talk a little more.

640
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,580
Is that all the Vice Chairman told you?

641
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,480
That I met with the chairwoman?

642
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,180
I took money from her.

643
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,370
You know...

644
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,830
that I like money.

645
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,830
So...

646
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,810
take care, Seo Ju Won.

647
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:03,780
♫  One less spark, clouds in your eyes  ♫

648
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:10,800
♫  Don't go alone  ♫

649
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:20,820
♫  The time won't let us go, I know  ♫

650
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,260
 When Cinderella's spell is lifted at midnight, 

651
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:27,400
 she doesn't pick up her slipper. 

652
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,310
 She disappears from the prince's sight. 

653
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,260
 Did she mean to leave a clear trace of herself? 

654
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:40,000
 No. 

655
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,400
 She would rather die than let him see her plain self. 

656
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:55,730
♫  I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

657
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,830
 I didn't want to leave a trace. 

658
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,630
 I wanted to disappear like a cool girl. 

659
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,350
♫  Hold on tight, alone without you  ♫

660
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,420
Our youngest employee suddenly takes time off?

661
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,720
In my day, that was unimaginable.

662
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,270
I know, right? A whole week, too.

663
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,910
What's going on with Ju Won?

664
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,460
I don't know. Let's start the meeting.

665
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,400
 For some, showing the sadness of a breakup is a luxury. 

666
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,300
As for this app for an individual,

667
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,610
to provide service between the consumers and businesses...

668
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:48,000
The consumer...

669
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,430
 The days take over me. 

670
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,550
How is Ji Seok doing at school?

671
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,400
♫  Shining on me  ♫

672
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,400
 The things I must be responsible for are waiting for me everywhere. 

673
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,290
You guys can head home.

674
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,400
Is it okay if we go home first?

675
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,690
I know! See you tomorrow.

676
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,990
Good night.

677
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,680
♫  Every woman will go through  ♫

678
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:30,600
♫  Shining blue  ♫

679
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,600

♫  When I look  ♫

682
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,190
 Even if I'm not okay, I must endure. 

683
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:49,840
 This is the ordinary life I chose instead of love. 

684
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,210
♫  To me  ♫

685
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,860
Yes, what's up?

686
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,570
 What do you mean? I'm worried about you. 

687
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,980
 Are you okay? 

688
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,340
- I'm– 
 -  No, you're not. 

689
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,570
So?

690
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,430
When will Seo Ju Won be back from vacation?

691
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,590
- Tomorrow, probably. 
 -  Maybe... 

692
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,110
he got transferred abroad.

693
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,660
I don't know.

694
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,370
What's wrong? Does your heart hurt thinking he left without saying goodbye?

695
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,010
What? I just tripped a little.

696
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,520
Bye. I need to work.

697
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,900
- Deputy, are you all right? 
 - Ju Won.

698
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,600
I'm okay.

699
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,140
Are you hurt?

700
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,110
I'm okay.

701
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,060
I said I'm okay–

702
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,460
I'm okay...

703
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,680
Wait here for a second.

704
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,270
I said I'm okay-

705
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,610
♫  I like the warmth  ♫

707
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,900
Deputy.

708

♫  You laugh at my boring jokes  ♫

709
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:26,790
♫  Just seeing your face gives me strength  ♫

710
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,730
♫  If you were I  ♫

711
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,900
♫  What would you do?  ♫

712
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,650
I will...

713
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,670
Yes...

714
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,420
♫  Then try to see where I'm in  ♫

715
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,000
Where did you find something so cute?

716
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,880
I'm glad you think it's cute.

717
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,400
The only store open was a stationery store.

718
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,200
And I think you got a scratch on your ankle.

719
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:00,330
♫  Ain't no pressure anyway  ♫

720
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:03,300
Would it be too much if I put it on for you?

721
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,000
It would be.

722
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,750
♫  Like this  ♫

723

♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

725
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,500
 We ended up as wounds for each other. 

726
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:34,100
 But someday, this wound will heal, too. 

727
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,010
My reflexology shoes hurt so much.

728
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:42,910
Let's go have some green tea.

729
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:18,420


730
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,040
Wait!

731
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,490
What?

732
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,200
It's here!

733
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,940
It's here!

734
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,350
Wow!

735
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,220
It looks so good!

736
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,030
What is all this?

737
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,520
Ice cream!

738
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,300
What is this? Daebak!

739
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,440
Green tea flavor!

740
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,340
 Team Leader! There's a fridge full of ice cream. 

741
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,120
 Plus a coffee machine and a massage chair! 

742

 Check the company message board right now. 

744
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,880
What's going on?

745
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,960
 Hurry up! Look at this! 

746
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,250

Thank you.

750
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,600
Okay, then.

751
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,070
They wanted to transfer me abroad,

752
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:38,110
but I convinced them to have me stay. That's why I'm late.

753
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:44,370
If you want to break up with me, that's your right.

754
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,400
But...

755
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,710
it's up to me to chase after you.

756
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,910
From now on,

757
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,240
I'll cling to you.

758
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,210
I'm going to be as pathetic as I can be.
