1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,330
   

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:11,060


3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,460
   

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,430
   

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,050
   

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,520
   

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,990
   

8
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,320
We're already here.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Why do you live so close? You should live further away.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,640
Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,040
Of course, I'll see you tomorrow. I'll call you when I get home.

12
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,610
Honey, you're leaving the hotel and going back home, okay?

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,680
All right. I'll go back home.

14
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,130
One second.

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,220
Hey, Ji Seok.

16
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,030
Where are you?

17
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,460
Seok Hyeon's house?

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,310
It's late. Come home in an hour.

19
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,370
Okay.

20
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,810
- I'll go in now. 
 - Okay.

21
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,280
♫  The more I get to know ya, can't tell the feelings I feel  ♫

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,540
♫  Sometimes it doesn't feel so right  ♫

23
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,590
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

24
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,550
What?

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,720
I'm coming in.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,890
What are you doing? Where do you think you're going?

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,250
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,260
Wow, so comfortable!

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,400
What is it? Why did you come in?

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,100
- Ji Seok won't be home for another hour. 
 - So?

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,930
So I'll stay for an hour.

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,020
Is this your house?

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,500
Is that the only way I could come in here?

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,300
We're lovers. Don't be so calculative.

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,830
It's not that.

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,270
What if Ji Seok comes home earlier?

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,070
- Honey, I'm suddenly getting chills. 
 - What?

38
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,420
If you give me a cup of hot chocolate, I'll drink it quick and go.

39
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,910
Please?

40
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,280
What?

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,030
What are you doing?

42
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,550
Honey.

43
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,590
Want to play the hot chocolate game?

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,860
What's that?

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,090
I was just saying whatever came to mind.

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,050
What?

47
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,430
- No. 
 - What?

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,040
What if Ji Seok walks in?

49
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,900
No. Don't drink the hot chocolate. Just go. Please? Hurry.

50
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,310
Get your jacket. Okay?

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,890
You're so mean. I'm just sad to say bye.

52
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,670
I'm sad, too.

53
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,090
But I live with a minor here.

54
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,570
That's why I said we could spend the night at the hotel—

55
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,600
What are you saying? Seriously...

56
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,230
I want to get married soon and be together.

57
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,850
Why aren't you answering?

58
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,310
What answer?

59
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,270
You don't wear the ring I gave you.

60
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,330
You haven't given me an answer to my proposal.

61
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,580
Well...

62
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,300
"Okay. Let's get married."

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,930
Can't you give me a clear answer like that?

64
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,670
In words?

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,060
Okay.

66
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,110
If you can't say it, I can't keep wishing for it.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm heading out with my lonely heart.

68
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,020
- Good night. 
 - Bye.

69
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,080
How can I say it?

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,200
   

71
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,740
What? What's wrong now?

72
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,310
Why do you keep staring and not say anything?

73
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,460
What is it?

74
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,630
You know...

75
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,690
I'm grateful that Ju Won has been waiting for me,

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,140
and I haven't given him a proper answer to his proposal.

77
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,960
So I want to organize some kind of event.

78
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,350
But I've never done this before.

79
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,410
So?

80
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,480
Do you have any ideas?

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,110
I looked up a few things. Want to tell me what sounds good?

82
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,050
Let me hear it.

83
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,890
♫  The door opens, and you come in  ♫

84
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:03,290
♫  I knew at first sight that you're the one  ♫

85
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:12,380
♫  You come to me, lower your head, I see your face in the light  ♫

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,090
♫  It's blindingly beautiful  ♫

87
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:25,960
♫  I'll tell you carefully, I'll be brave  ♫

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,440
 Don't be brave. Pass. 

89
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,700
 Are we in the 90s? 

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,370
 Why not just write a message on a sketchbook? 
   

91
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,720
What? Uncle, how long have you been listening?

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,750
Since you started singing that cheesy song.

93
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,780
- You don't like cheesy? 
 - No.

94
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,210
It's cheesy and cringey.

95
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,300
I can't believe that a marketing team leader

96
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,130
at a big corporation came up with that.

97
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,690
It's so cringe.

98
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,710
Be honest. You didn't quit, right?

99
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,330
You got fired, right?

100
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,040
What are you saying? Work and love are different.

101
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,230
- I'm leaving. 
 - Wait.

102
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,950
Ji Seok called the restaurant earlier.

103
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,700
Ji Seok? Why?

104
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,880
He's always been interested in cooking.

105
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,510
He wants to start cooking and is wondering if he should go to a school.

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,170
Really?

107
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,760
I'm home.

108
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,810
You're home.

109
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,180
Perfect timing.

110
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,700
Yay, braised galbi*! 
  (*short ribs) 

111
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,550
- It's beef. Beef galbi. 
 - Looks good.

112
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,510
Thanks.

113
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,750
Are you Gordon Ramsey or something?

114
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,670
Why are you tasting everything so slowly?

115
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,490
Trying to see if you have a talent for cooking.

116
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,440
I heard you called Uncle Jae Ha.

117
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,720
Well...

118
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,500
I just wanted to accomplish something on my own.

119
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,330
Speaking of, Nuna,

120
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,050
I'm thinking of going to culinary school while working part-time.

121
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:43,500
At first, I cooked so I could do something for you while you worked for both of us.

122
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,440
But as I kept doing it, I felt like I had talent.

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,490
It's fun.

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,820
Come here. I have something to give you.

125
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,320
- But we're eating. 
 - Come on.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,900
- What is it? 
 - Just come with me.

127
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,600
Is it good? Wait–

128
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,850
What?

129
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,460
One, ten, hundred, thousand...

130
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,280
What is this?

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,340
A separate bank account I set up for you since I was in college.

132
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,890
It's too much.

133
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,900
No thanks, Nuna.

134
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,080
If I give you a monthly allowance, you'll feel bad asking for more.

135
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,200
You can sign up for culinary school or travel...

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Be smart about it and use it well.

137
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,530
You're an adult now. You should know how to manage money.

138
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,380
You could have just wired it. Who carries a paper bankbook these days?

139
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,860
Hey!

140
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,120
Wow. Is that yours? Can I see?

141
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,730
How dare you! That's my drawer!

142
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,370
Get out. Go eat.

143
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,830
Thank you.

144
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,920
   

145
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,320
 I will break up with Ju Won. 

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,720
 How much would be enough? 

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,280
 You can keep your promise to break up 

148
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,810
 with Ju Won, right? 

149
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,620
 I guess I need to do this before I give him an answer. 

150
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,660
She's here.

151
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,990
I'm sorry to reach out so suddenly.

152
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,780
So?

153
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,110
What do you want?

154
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm here to return the money you gave me.

155
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,950
I wanted to see you in person

156
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,490
and apologize as well.

157
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Does that mean

158
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,990
you can't keep your promise?

159
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,730
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,680
I thought I would be able to break up with him.

161
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,800
I thought if I took the money,

162
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,500
the guilt and the responsibility would make me do it.

163
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,310
But it was easier said than done.

164
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,560
Do you want my permission to marry him or something?

165
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,190
I have nothing to gain from it.

166
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,100
I know I'm not good enough, but-

167
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,160
I think...

168
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,320
you've got it wrong.

169
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,530
I've dealt with you until now because

170
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,900
at least you understood reality.

171
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,340
Now,

172
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,230
it's not worth my effort.

173
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,570
What's going on?

174
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,360
- Is there a problem? 
 - I'm on the Marketing Team 1.

175
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,700
My entry pass isn't working.

176
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,510
One minute.

177
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,590
Can you check this?

178
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,240
We checked, and

179
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,220
it says you're no longer with the company.

180
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,120
What?

181
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,300
Team Leader, you only told us about leaving a few days ago.

182
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,870
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

183
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,360
Are you speeding things up because you're embarrassed to see us?

184
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,300
- What? 
 - We know you and the director are together again.

185
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,770
We've noticed. You're embarrassed that we know, right?

186
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,080
If that's why you're pushing up your departure date,

187
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,230
we'll pretend like we don't know, so please stay. Please?

188
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,360
It's not like that. The plan was always to leave after finishing up my projects.

189
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
Oh, and this.

190
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,630
This will help you with the transition.

191
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,430
If something is inadequate or difficult, please let me know.

192
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,460
Okay.

193
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,370
Deputy Bae, you'll be great...

194
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,500
It's Team Leader Bae now.

195
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,240
Director, Team Leader is leaving.

196
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,990
You knew today was Team Leader Ha's last day, right?

197
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,010
One second.

198
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,890
What? Where are you going?

199
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,180
HR.

200
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,400
I need to know why you're out without my approval.

201
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,040
I went to see the chairwoman.

202
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,170
Excuse us.

203
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,990
Let's talk over there.

204
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,940
What do you mean? Why would my mother-

205
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,340
I reached out to her first.

206
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,040
I wanted to return the money.

207
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,370
Why would you do that alone? Did you think of telling me first?

208
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,890
It's not like that.

209
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,580
If I had told you I was going to see her,

210
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,630
you would have been worried.

211
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,200
Worried that she would speak cruelly to me,

212
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,300
and that it would sway me again.

213
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,780
But Ju Won, I can't be swayed anymore.

214
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,990
I knew she wouldn't welcome me.

215
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,410
I'm okay with her processing my resignation.

216
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,700
What do you mean?

217
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,680
Don't take it so seriously.

218
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,380
I returned the money that I was uneasy about.

219
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,660
I can be with you proudly from now on.

220
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,820
I was already going to quit,

221
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,870
and she pushed it up, so I have a week-long vacation now.

222
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,880
- But still–&nbsp;
 - Now that I'm by your side,

223
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,740
I'll just push forward from now on.

224
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,740
So let's not be so melodramatic.

225
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,770
Aigoo, I haven't taken a nap in forever.

226
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm going to sleep until dinner.

227
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,880
What?

228
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,950
Twenty minutes?

229
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,830
I'm so disappointed.

230
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,100
Why can't I sleep?

231
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,960
Right. Hanging out while everyone else is working?

232
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,680
I've always wanted to do that.

233
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,820
But what did I want to do?

234
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,020
 The Design Team is buying coffee for the meeting. Send in your orders! 

235
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,980
 I'll take an iced cafe mocha with extra whipping cream! 

236
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,770
 I don't think I should be here when you guys talk about work. 

237
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,860
 I'm going to exit the group chat now. 

238
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,360
Aigoo, Ye Yeong! 
    

239
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,650
You should have made a new chat! Why did you text this one?

240
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,660
Stop. I'm already regretting it.

241
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,140
But seeing her leave the group chat makes it really sink in.

242
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,690
I didn't know she'd leave so suddenly.

243
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,910
I know. She was scary, but she grew on me.

244
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,390
Let's go to the meeting.

245
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,980
Hello.

246
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,030
Hello.

247
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,020
Is it true about Team Leader Ha Yun Seo?

248
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,170
What?

249
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,260
Her leaving? That's...

250
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,570
No, not that. She wasn't allowed to enter this morning.

251
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,380
- Pardon? 
 - Not allowed in?

252
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,500
I was on my way in and saw her flustered that her entry pass wasn't working.

253
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,020
So the security checked for her

254
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,230
and said she was no longer with the company as of today.

255
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,430
Great work.

256
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,800
Thank you.

257
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,270
What? So up until this morning,

258
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,370
she didn't know her resignation had been processed.

259
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,370
That's why the director's face looked like that!

260
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,790
I knew it. He looked really mad.

261
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,610
But if it was an administrative error,

262
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,690
the director could have fixed it quickly so why–

263
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,870
I think the chairwoman fired the Team Leader!

264
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,810
No way! Why would she do that?

265
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,370
Why else? When she found out they were together,

266
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,950
the chairwoman went to Team Leader and told her to break up with him.

267
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,290
But they're back together, so she kicked her out of the company.

268
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,190
Right. The chairwoman is the only one with that much power.

269
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,810
- Oh, no... 
 - My goodness...

270
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,540
- Mr. Lee. 
 - Hello.

271
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,630
What brings you here?

272
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,400
I had a meeting with PR and wanted to see you.

273
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,370
I brought snacks too.

274
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,830
Thank you.

275
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,750
If you were here earlier, you would have seen Team Leader.

276
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,160
She quit.

277
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,910
She had already given notice,

278
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,550
but it got pushed up.

279
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,680
She left as of today.

280
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,580
I see.

281
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,690
Yes, Team Leader.

282
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,970
I heard you left the company.

283
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,750
 Yes. I'm sorry I didn't get to tell you before. 

284
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,590
The transition went well.

285
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,080
It shouldn't cause any issues moving forward.

286
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,790
I don't know.

287
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,600
It's your opinion that it shouldn't cause issues.

288
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,100
 I said yes to the exhibit because of you. 

289
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,200
I feel scammed by AL Card for not informing me of this in advance.

290
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,090
Pardon?

291
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,040
 Let's meet up and talk. 

292
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,700
- See you at my studio. 
 - Mr. Lee–

293
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,490
What? Yun Seo went to see Mother?

294
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,700
Yun Seo is really something.

295
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,300
Not many people could confront Mother like that.

296
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,020
Hey. Be optimistic.

297
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,280
Yun Seo is solid, so you just need to convince Mother.

298
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,730
Do everything you can.

299
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,850
I mean, I guess there's nothing else you can do.

300
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,760
You asked her to trust and wait,

301
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,350
you appealed to her emotions and even left home.

302
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,560
What are you going to do now?

303
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,670
Are you making fun of me?

304
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,480
Hey. I'm not making fun of you. I'm just worried.

305
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,150
Wondering what you need to do.

306
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,600
Geez, I'd buy you a drink tonight,

307
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,690
but I have plans with my wife.

308
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,850
Hey, want to join us?

309
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,100
No. I need to go see Yun Seo after work.

310
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,420
I'm so worried, but she told me to stay at work.

311
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,540
I wonder how she's doing now.

312
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,200
Mr. Lee?

313
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,480
- Ta-da! 
 - My goodness!

314
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,370
Congratulations on quitting!

315
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,010
What?

316
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,140
I wanted to tell you

317
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,640
good job working so hard that the DNA of labor is in your bones.

318
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,150
I thought you wouldn't just come so I faked an act.

319
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,570
I guess you're going to finish off by being an id...

320
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,720
- An id? 
 - An id...

321
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,060
Idea! Having a fun idea.

322
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,840
It's not like you work at AL Card.

323
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,900
You didn't have to do this.

324
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,140
I'm genuinely thankful.

325
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,220
You're the reason I got to do the exhibit.

326
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,860
I wanted to start showing my work,

327
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,050
but I wasn't sure where or how to start.

328
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,910
Then you proposed a great plan.

329
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,510
Because it was you, I could make the decision.

330
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,680
I'm grateful for that.

331
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:52,800
♫  It still has to be you  ♫

332
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,110
   

333
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,070
- One second. 
 - Okay.

334
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,280
   

335
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,040
Hey, Ju Won.

336
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,510
 What are you doing? 

337
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,620
Oh, I'm out.

338
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,550
♫  Congratulations on quitting!  ♫

339
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,350
♫  Congratulations on quitting!  ♫

340
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,960
♫  Congratulations dear-!  ♫

341
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,260
Dear– Anyway,

342
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,940
♫  Congratulations on quitting!  ♫

343
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,530
 Who is that? 

344
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,170
Who called you "dear"?

345
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,380
Wait. Congratulating you on quitting?

346
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,600
It's the Artist Lee Seong Min.

347
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,260
 I ended up at his studio. 

348
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,240
He got me a cake for working hard all this time.

349
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,010
I didn't expect this when I came-

350
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,980
Got it. Bye for now.

351
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,360
Seo Ju Won?

352
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,520
Twenty-five minutes.

353
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,030
Sorry? What?

354
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,780
I'd give it 25 minutes until Seo Ju Won gets here.

355
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,200
We're 50 minutes away, but he'll make it in 25.

356
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,400
Why would Ju Won come here? What did we do?

357
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,850
Want to make a bet whether he comes or not?

358
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,060
Blow out your candle.

359
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,460
Let's go.

360
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,770
Where?

361
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,310
It's not a farewell party without wine.

362
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,770
There's a nice place nearby.

363
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,830
They had one table left so I booked it.

364
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,420
I think Seo Ju Won will be here soon. Let's go.

365
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,200
What do you mean...

366
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,770
 Yun Seo! 

367
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,300
What? He actually showed up?

368
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,960
It hasn't even been 25 minutes!

369
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,780
Let's go, Yun Seo.

370
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,400
Where? You said you'll drink wine with me.

371
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,060
Drink wine with me, Yun Seo.

372
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,090
She said she'd drink with me.

373
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,820
Why would Yun Seo drink wine with you?

374
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,210
It's a farewell party!

375
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,110
How long have you known her to throw a party?

376
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,970
I should throw her a party since I worked with her for a long time.

377
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,290
Have a farewell party with me.

378
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,910
Then you should have prepared one. I had the idea first.

379
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,780
Go with me.

380
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,200
What is this déjà vu?

381
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,420
Stop it, you two!

382
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,260
I think I should eat with Mr. Lee tonight.

383
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,260
I've wanted to buy him dinner to thank him for everything.

384
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,860
If I saw him another night, you'd be upset.

385
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,410
So since I'm already here, I'll have dinner with him.

386
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,690
 You lose. 
   

387
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,850
 You win. 
   

388
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,170
Can Ju Won come?

389
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,240
The three of us can all go.

390
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,060
   

391
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,880
Let's go.

392
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,330
Wait for me, Yun Seo.

393
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,810
I have to lead the way. You don't even know where you're going!

394
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,600
It's good, right?

395
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,100
I've been here before, but I wanted to bring you.

396
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,000
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

397
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,810
So I know this is a weird thing to say as a couple,

398
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,180
but doesn't it feel like we're flirting?

399
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,240
A little?

400
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,790
Honestly, after seeing my parents' loveless marriage,

401
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,150
I was against arranged marriages.

402
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,900
But now, I think they might be good.

403
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,600
I mean, I never imagined I could feel like this in our marriage.

404
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,650
Then convince Ju Won. Mother is heartbroken.

405
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,740
But...

406
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,250
I want to root for Ju Won, too.

407
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,130
I understand how he must feel.

408
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,160
I know from experience, I–

409
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,810
Why did you stop? Keep going. What did you experience?

410
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,700
N-Nothing. Pretend you didn't hear it.

411
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,970
I heard it. How can I pretend I didn't? Who doesn't have a past?

412
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,890
Past? No way.

413
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,400
It was forever ago when I was young. My first love–

414
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,900
Your first love.

415
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,220
Did you break up because of your mother, like Ju Won?

416
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,630
- That's... 
 - You must have been lost, too,

417
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,550
enough to understand him.

418
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,530
That's why you're against arranged marriages.

419
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,860
You must have hated me, right?

420
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
No, no.

421
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Why is this so hard?

422
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,900
- Go ahead. 
 - O-Okay.

423
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,840
Why did you say that? You're so clueless!

424
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,920
I mean...

425
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,570
me.

426
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,480
I was just trying to say, "I like this marriage."

427
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,590
But what's wrong with my wife? She's not a kid. Why get upset about the past?

428
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,170
 Wait. 

429
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,560
 Is this jealousy? 

430
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,570
What? What do I do with her?

431
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,660
Hey.

432
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,370
It's you.

433
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,960
I mean...

434
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,570
me.

435
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,480
Should we get a cup of tea while we're out?

436
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,400
Hot tea that's good for insomnia.

437
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,390
I think you need a stiff whiskey more than a cup of hot tea.

438
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,630
You must want a drink, being wistful about your first love.

439
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,950
I'll leave you be, so have a drink and enjoy your solitude.

440
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,210
 What is that cute pout? 

441
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,410
 Is she jealous again? 

442
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,720
 She's like a child. 

443
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,410
Mi Jin!

444
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,910
Oppa Hyo Seong!

445
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,890
Oppa?

446
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,900
Hey, how have you been?

447
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,110
You've gotten so pretty! I almost didn't recognize you!

448
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,700
Wow, you look so different!

449
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,140
You look amazing. Do you work out?

450
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,750
Of course, I do.

451
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,980
My goodness.

452
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,520
This must be your husband.

453
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,540
Hello, I'm Kim Hyo Seong.

454
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,390
Hi.

455
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,190
I'm Seo Si Won.

456
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,250
What a great view.

457
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,190
I didn't realize you made a reservation at such a nice place.

458
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,670
Although the table feels a bit crowded.

459
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,140
I know. All that bragging about the restaurant and look at the table.

460
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,030
I barely managed to get the last table. I had no idea it was a two-person table.

461
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,890
Who made a two-person table into a three-person table?

462
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,070
It's weird to come to a place like this with someone with a boyfriend.

463
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,800
- A place like this? What is that? 
 - Somewhere nice and romantic.

464
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,740
This is not romantic. It's ordinary.

465
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,070
You must not come to places like this often.

466
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,520
Take Yun Seo somewhere nice, please?

467
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,880
Excuse me, this dinner is for me, right?

468
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,240
I'm very uncomfortable right now.

469
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,730
Right? Mr. Lee makes people uncomfortable.

470
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,060
Should we go somewhere else by ourselves?

471
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,540
Honestly, Seo Ju Won, you should be thankful.

472
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,620
I don't want to take credit for this, but...

473
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,500
the two of you are back together, thanks to me.

474
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,850
You're so funny, Mr. Lee.

475
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,640
How is it thanks to you?

476
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,380
At the pork stew restaurant, she was crying so much, saying she missed you,

477
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,160
so I called you to come pick her up!

478
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,400
Honestly, as for you two getting back together...

479
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,370
When Yun Seo had given up because she thought you were going to Spain forever,

480
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,450
I gave her the courage to run over to you right away.

481
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,400
Sounds like you two talked a lot while I was gone.

482
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,390
   

483
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,720
Hey, Ji Seok. Excuse me.

484
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,990
Yes.

485
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,590
I think I need to step out for a minute.

486
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,610
Is something wrong?

487
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,570
Oh, Ji Seok went to sign up for classes, and it's nearby.

488
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,000
I want to take a look, too.

489
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,390
The steak isn't even here, and I don't want to end the night.

490
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,690
I'll be right back.

491
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,510
I'll come with you.

492
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,900
Ji Seok likes me.

493
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,950
You?

494
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,960
Ji Seok?

495
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,070
Oh, of course. He likes you a lot.

496
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,870
But we can't leave Mr. Lee by himself.

497
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,450
I'll be right back.

498
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,920
- Bye. 
 - Sure.

499
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,270
Go over there.

500
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,290
I have a question.

501
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,060
What?

502
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,510
I'm not super curious, but...

503
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,550
I'm just a little curious.

504
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:41,070
Who's the guy who called you "Mi Jin" earlier?

505
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,520
- Oh, my first love. 
 - What?

506
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,950
You think you're the only one with first love? I used to love someone deeply, too.

507
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,610
For two fiery years.

508
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,060
I was with her for three years. It was fiery, too.

509
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,280
Mine was fierier! Like a blast furnace!

510
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,530
Mine was like lava!

511
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,760
I cried for a month after we broke up!

512
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,520
I cried for a year! I thought I would never love again!

513
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,190
Fine!

514
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,830
Then don't ever love again.

515
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,900
Fine! I won't!

516
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,900
T-This isn't it...

517
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,880
Why did I have to pick that battle?

518
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,500
Gosh, seriously!

519
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,430
No, no!

520
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,090
Who's upset at whom? Forget it.

521
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,410
What do I expect from a loveless arranged marriage anyway?

522
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,760
But still!

523
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,830
I said–

524
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,860
I said I like you!

525
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,780
Darn it!

526
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,520
I hate her.

527
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,650
Can I ask you a question?

528
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,460
Throwing her a party and all...

529
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,720
you don't still have feelings for her, do you?

530
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,000
Actually,

531
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,240
I like Ha Yun Seo.

532
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,880
- What did you say? 
 - I also like you, Seo Ju Won.

533
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,810
What?

534
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:46,360
I like both of you.

535
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm invested. Maybe because you remind me of my own past.

536
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,460
Your family is against your relationship, right?

537
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,630
What's the surprise? Everyone at the office seems to know.

538
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,270
So...

539
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,280
are you ready?

540
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,920
Well...

541
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,770
I'm trying.

542
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,380
I'm trying to show her that

543
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,260
I can expand the business myself without an arranged marriage.

544
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,840
But doesn't that take years?

545
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,280
What about Ha Yun Seo?

546
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,340
That's why I left home, willing to give up everything–

547
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,560
That's what a guy like me does.

548
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,420
You know I cut ties with my family because they were against me painting, right?

549
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,440
Well, yes.

550
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,380
The reason I was able to do that

551
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,610
was because I only had myself to protect.

552
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,300
But you also need to protect Ha Yun Seo.

553
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,150
So how can you leave home like a runaway teenager,

554
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,420
lash out at your mother, and act emotionally?

555
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,350
Then what should I do?

556
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,370
Actually...

557
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,160
I don't like the saying, "Parents always give in to their children."

558
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,700
There are plenty of parents who overpower their children.

559
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,800
So don't try to have her give in.

560
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,630
See her eye to eye.

561
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,400
You're willing to give up everything to protect your love.

562
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,600
Your mother must have something she wants to protect, too.

563
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,210
Try to understand her and have an honest conversation.

564
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,390
Who knows?

565
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,850
Perhaps you might get through to her.

566
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,610
Sorry, I'm late. I had to talk to the teacher-

567
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,640
What? You drank all that while I was gone?

568
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,140
Yes.

569
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,940
Yun Seo.

570
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,300
- I see Mr. Lee so differently now. 
 - Oh?

571
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,330
I thought he was a total nutjob, but he's the man.

572
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,350
Wait, why do you keep speaking informally? I'm older.

573
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm your university sunbae, too.

574
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,910
Right, right.

575
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,290
Then mister... I mean...

576
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:45,470
Seonbaenim. Can I call you Seonbaenim from now on?

577
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,580
I like that.

578
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,540
What is this out of the blue?

579
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,130
Seonbaenim.

580
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,190
Honestly, I envied you, Seonbaenim.

581
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:59,320
I also had a childhood dream, but I gave it up.

582
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,980
But Seonbaenim, you don't know how to give up.

583
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,830
I look up to you so much.

584
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,600
Hubaenim, I had no idea.

585
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,820
That must have been so difficult.

586
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,000
At the time, it was so...

587
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,660
frustrating.

588
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,090
Was it frustrating?

589
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,900
Then you need to yell!

590
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,230
What do you mean yell?

591
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,380
Yell.

who worked so hard for AL Card.

Why am I home?

627
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:41,420
 Mother, I'm home! 

628
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,340
 How have you been? 

629
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:48,410
 Oh, my, my. 

630
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,490
 Mother, you're too much. 

631
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,230
 Am I too much for catching you when you were about to fall 

632
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,090
 or are you too much for coming home in the middle of the night? 

633
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,820
 You, Mother! 

634
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,790
 How can you fire Yun Seo at once like that? 

635
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,320
 Before Yun Seo was my girlfriend, 

636
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,670
 she was a competent employee who worked hard for your company. 

637
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,920
 So how can you kick her out overnight? 

638
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,020
 Let's talk when you're sober. 

639
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,410
 Can't you just approve of us? 

640
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,140
 This is the first time I've asked something 

641
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,150
 from you like this. 

642
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,750
 The first time since that day. 

643
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,070
 Hyeong, look at this! I'm going to be a sculptor. 

644
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:55,960
 I made them in school today. This is a dog, and this is a turtle. 

645
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,730
 Really? You did a great job! 

646
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,650
 Hyeong! When is Mommy coming home? 

647
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,960
 I don't know. She said this business trip is going to take a while. 

648
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,560
 Maybe sometime next week? 

649
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,010
 I want to show these to her soon. 

650
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,000
 - Mom! 
 - Yes? 

651
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,860
 Mom, I know what I want to be when I grow up. 

652
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,480
 I'm going to be a sculptor. 

653
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,480
 This is a present for you. 

654
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,630
 Seo Ju Won, what do I dislike the most? 

655
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,500
 Well... 

656
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,790
 Not doing things that you're supposed to do. 

657
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,130
 Did you neglect the things 

658
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,340
 you're supposed to do because you were making these? 

659
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:53,180
 You've done enough of sculpture, so let's stop now. 

660
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,800
 Okay? 

661
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,870
 Okay. 

662
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,300
 After that day, 

663
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,060
 I haven't had a dream. 

664
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,520
 For me to have a dream 

665
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,430
 was to let you down. 

666
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,980
 Since that day, I've never dreamed of anything. 

667
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,100
 But, Mother, 

668
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,220
 I want to be happy now. 

669
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,580
That old story...

670
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,760
Why did I...

671
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,630
 Your mother must have something she wants to protect, too. 

672
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,620
 Try to understand her and have an honest conversation. 

673
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,210
 I want to be happy now. 

674
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:58,360
Are you here to argue with me again?

675
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,320
For making the girl you like suffer?

676
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,160
I'm sorry.

677
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:10,320
I shouldn't have brought up those things while drunk.

678
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:17,260
But I wasn't trying to blame you, Mother.

679
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,840
It hurt when I was a child, but...

680
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,620
I know now that you wanted to educate me

681
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,460
about what I can and cannot do.

682
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,510
But...

683
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,520
I meant it when I said I wanted to be happy.

684
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,700
Are you...

685
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,110
unhappy now?

686
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,770
I mean that if I'm with Yun Seo,

687
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,580
I can be even happier.

688
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,880
After you left home,

689
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,190
I waited.

690
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,760
I had to drive her to the edge of the cliff for you to come back.

691
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,010
As a mother...

692
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,300
it's sad.

693
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,400
- That... 
 - What you said about

694
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,230
being your mother instead of the chairwoman...

695
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:27,070
It kept bothering me.

696
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,200
I know I wasn't a tender mother to you.

697
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,830
But as long as you're born as my son,

698
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:41,230
I thought I had to raise you two as strong men.

699
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:44,120
Then someday,

700
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,850
I thought you would thank me, like your brother.

701
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,890
But you...

702
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,060
seem different from your brother.

703
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,600
Just know that I didn't wish you...

704
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,510
unhappiness.

705
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,890
I don't know how I'll be able to...

706
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,360
face her from now on.

707
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,690
Should I have stopped him from going home?

708
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,630
He wouldn't have picked a fight with her while drunk, right?

709
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,870
   

710
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,370
Hey. Everything was okay last night, right?

711
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,640
What do you mean?

712
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,750
 I mean, you just seemed really drunk. 

713
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,460
You didn't...

714
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,700
lash out at her, yell, or...

715
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:14,440
No. You asked me not to so many times.

716
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,460
Yun Seo.

717
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,870
 Huh? 

718
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,880
Never mind.

719
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,120
What? Tell me.

720
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,910
I don't want to be rash so I was going to be careful,

721
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,770
but it's such good news that I want to share it as soon as possible.

722
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:31,500
What is it? Tell me.

723
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,330
My mother...

724
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,640
seems more open.

725
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,020
What?

726
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,030
Good morning.

727
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm not sure.

728
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,430
I don't know if it's that good.

729
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,090
I just made too much.

730
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,670
I don't want to waste the beans.

731
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,530
These beans probably taste as bittersweet as the memory of your first love.

732
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,220
Enjoy!

733
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,590
Mi Jin.

734
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,240
I'm going to call you that now.

735
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,050
Can I?

736
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,900
Well, you can or whatever. But what? Why did you call me?

737
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,130
Do you want to date me?

738
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,080
What in the world.

739
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,700
We're married. How can we date?

740
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,130
I don't know what the order is, either.

741
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:22,180
But we skipped telling you my feelings, dating, and got married, so it's confusing.

742
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,160
I don't know what I'm allowed to do and what I'm not.

743
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,340
Actually, I was jealous yesterday.

744
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,460
Jealous?

745
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,110
It was unpleasant to see your first love with my own eyes.

746
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:41,110
That's why I acted childishly.

747
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,800
I'm sorry.

748
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,460
Right...

749
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:50,240
Well... that guy...

750
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,390
is my second cousin.

751
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,910
What?

752
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,330
He was at our wedding,

753
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:58,760
so I thought you'd recognize him. But you didn't, so...

754
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,350
I lied and said he was my first love so I wouldn't lose.

755
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,900
I was jealous, too.

756
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,280
Right? You were jealous, right?

757
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,190
You like me, too, right?

758
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,340
I told you I liked you at the supermarket last time

759
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,700
and you didn't say anything. So, I was embarrassed.

760
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,010
Do you...

761
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,800
really like me, too?

762
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,990
I do.

763
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,760
Does that mean we can

764
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,540
walk locking arms and holding hands on the street?

765
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,690
We can.

766
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,350
As family, roommates, and business partners,

767
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,840
the rule about picking one text, KakaoTalk, or phone call a day...

768
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,760
Can I just reach out whenever I think of you now?

769
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,390
You can.

770
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,820
How about this?

771
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,820
This early in the morning?

772
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,600
Then...

773
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,730
at night?

774
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,350
Why isn't she answering?

775
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:08,100
What? You didn't call!

776
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,960
Now that I'm unemployed, I came to pick you up.

777
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,350
I really wanted to try picking up my boyfriend from work.

778
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:18,100
Oh, we'll be late. Help me move stuff from my car.

779
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:22,510
I also wanted to try going on an impromptu trip, so I brought camping equipment.

780
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,140
Really?

781
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,180
I also brought your clothes.

782
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,230
Thank you.

783
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,450
♫  Sweet drama  ♫

784
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,700

You're such a genius, Honey.

797
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,870
Bringing sweet potatoes, too?

798
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,580
Of course. It's AL Card's loss for letting go of a talent like me.

799
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:04,150
But still, I'm glad the Chairwoman opened up a bit.

800
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:08,250
Actually...

801
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:11,090
I've been feeling weird.

802
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,960
I know I put in my notice myself,

803
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,040
but it felt like I got kicked out.

804
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,680
It's been confusing.

805
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,110
But...

806
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,390
when you called me this morning,

807
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:29,240
I was so happy that I forgot about all that.

808
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,910
I'm sorry.

809
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,260
And thank you.

810
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,900
Skip the sorry.

811
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,190
Just say "thank you" from now on.

812
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,340
But, Honey,

813
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,000
I think I burned my finger just now

814
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,780
baking the sweet potato. It hurts a little.

815
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,230
Really?

816
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,100
Let me see.

817
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:06,850
♫  If you were I, what would you do?  ♫

818
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,190
♫  Then try to see where I'm in  ♫

819
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,990
I love you.

820
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,870
Let's get married.

821
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:37,110
♫  Ain't no pressure anyway  ♫

822
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,930
♫  I keep looking at you  ♫

823
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:47,200
♫  You're catching my eyes  ♫

824
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:58,000
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

825
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:27,030
You must have been surprised that I asked to see you.

826
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,640
So...

827
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,100
let me get straight to the point.

828
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,030
You have my permission

829
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,150
to marry Ju Won.

830
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,450
Under one condition.

831
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:46,300
I want you to take care of our scholarship foundation.

832
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:48,840
Scholarship foundation?

833
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:53,640
Since you grew up poor, having you run it

834
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,640
will look authentic, right?

835
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,090
A Cinderella who married a chaebol

836
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,510
now helps those who are in her position

837
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:07,170
by running a scholarship foundation.

838
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,710
Well...

839
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,680
we need a fairytale like that.

840
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,080
Go ahead

841
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,790
and live as a true Cinderella.

842
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:50,460
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

843
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:55,000
♫  You shine so far away  ♫

844
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,160
♫  If I reach out my hands, I can almost touch it  ♫

845
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,640
   

846
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,230
 Let's reveal your background and proceed with the wedding. 

847
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,960
 Is this why you started seeing my sister again? 

848
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,990
 To sell our past and use it? 

849
01:02:10,990 --> 01:02:14,190
 Are my sister's painful memories just an opportunity for you? 

850
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:18,050
 Our mother really made you that offer? 

851
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:19,430
 How rude. 

852
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,750
 Why are you always so understanding? 

853
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,220
 She seemed like a person standing on the edge of a cliff. 

854
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,330
 Nice necklace. 

855
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,500
 Don't you know? 

856
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,700
 She's being cold. It must be a necklace I should know about. 

857
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:37,900
 Perhaps reality could be even lovelier than the fairytale. 

858
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:51,050
♫  Under the red sunset, I get ready to face the night  ♫

859
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:55,490
♫  You're my only one shining star  ♫

860
01:02:55,490 --> 01:03:00,050
♫  You shine so far away  ♫

861
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:03,950
♫  If I reach out my hands, I can almost touch it  ♫

862
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:10,700
♫  But I still have a way to go  ♫

863
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:17,600


864
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,940
♫  Night after night, I've been waiting for today  ♫

865
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,730
♫  Sailing to you, through the darkness  ♫

866
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:33,550
♫  I'm ready to face you now  ♫

867
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:39,860
♫  Night after night, I've been waiting for today  ♫

868
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,690
♫  Sailing to you, through the darkness  ♫

869
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:52,040
♫  I'm ready to face you now  ♫

870
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,380
♫  You're my only one shining star  ♫

871
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,910
♫  You're looking at me from far away  ♫

872
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:06,820
♫  My journey to you  ♫

873
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:11,880
♫  I see the end  ♫

874
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,380
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

875
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,840
♫  You're dazzling in front of me  ♫

876
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,780
♫  I can't forget this moment  ♫

877
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:31,940
♫  You are the whole new paradise  ♫

878
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,740
♫  My journey to you  ♫

879
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:47,770
♫  I see the end  ♫

880
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:52,170
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

881
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,640
♫  You're dazzling in front of me  ♫

882
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,650
♫  I can't forget this moment  ♫

883
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:08,090
♫  You are the whole new paradise  ♫
