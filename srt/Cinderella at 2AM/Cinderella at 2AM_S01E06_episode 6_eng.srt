1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,630
   

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,660
   

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,600
   

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,320
   

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,410
   

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:35,170


7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,040
   

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,760
You said you left your car at Han River.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,670
Let me drive you. We can talk on the way.

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,280
Okay.

11
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,660
I'm sorry,

12
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,180
but she was talking to me first.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,900
Don't you want to know how I know that you're Ha Yun Seo?

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,680
Let me explain everything. Let's go eat.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,080
Let's go to Han River.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
Let's eat.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,860
Let's go to Han River.

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,240
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's go to Han River.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,450
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's go to Han River.

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,500
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's go to Han River.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,300
- Let's eat Han River. 
 - What?

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
My tongue got twisted.

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,210
You can eat Han River by yourself.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,260
Let's go eat.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,730
I'll hear the story later.

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,220
Let's go. I have something to tell you, too.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,100
What are you doing?

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,090
Can you give me a ride, too?

29
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,920
You said you're going to Han River. I'm going in that direction.

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,780
Where is that?

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,000
How do you know where along the river my car is at?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
It has to be somewhere on Earth. Seoul's not as big as you think.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,950
Oh, if it's near Yongsan, even better.

34
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,670
Director, let's go.

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,200
   

36
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,680
   

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,160
Am I right?

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,700
Erase that!

39
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,110
   

40
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,550
   

41
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,770
So...

42
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,690
how do you two know each other?

43
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,850
How do I explain this?

44
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,260
We became close through texting first.

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,770
Rather than that, you were texting the wrong number.

46
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,110
That's right.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,710
I thought I was sending them to someone I know.

48
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,530
Maybe because the texts were sentimental,

49
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,960
Team Leader thought they were from her ex-boyfriend.

50
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,900
She said her heart sank like she was getting a disaster alert.

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,930
 What are you doing? 

52
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,540
 We said we'd break up. This is wrong, no? 

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,350
-  This is wrong, no? 
   

54
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,750
You two seem close for people who connected over the wrong number.

55
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,090
Actually, we do have a connection.

56
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,610
Maybe because we texted and called often?

57
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,450
That was all your doing–

58
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,220
Never mind.

59
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,890
How did you know I was Ha Yun Seo from AL?

60
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,160
By coincidence.

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,470
The AL Hanok Stay opening exhibit?

62
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,400
I know you're in a pinch, but it seems too much like a backup option.

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,000
 You know you were our original first choice. 

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,280
 - I'd like to talk to you in person.  
 - No need.

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,780
I have the proposal you sent before. I'll call you after I look over it.

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,790
   

67
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,790
   

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,480
   

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,040
It seemed like a fun project with a fun connection

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,070
so I accepted it right away.

71
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,790
I don't believe in fate,

72
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,810
but I almost did this time.

73
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,440
You can drop me off at the subway station. That'll be faster.

74
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,340
Team Leader, I'll call you.

75
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,920
Make sure you save my number.

76
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait, I asked you to drop me off over there.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,630
It's busy over there.

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,590
Why don't you just walk? It's not that far.

79
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,400
It's empty over there. It's not busy–

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,300
All right, see you later.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,280
 What? By chance... 

82
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,570
Do you still not know how to write a report?

83
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,000
Do it again!

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,380
All right.

85
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,780
- Ju Won. 
 - Yes.

86
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,070
Get me a latte.

87
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay.

88
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,500
Honey, did you see it? My revenge?

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Deputy Bae called me, but I waited three seconds before answering.

90
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,630
You did?

91
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,610
What a cruel revenge.

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,120
A few days ago, he was picking on me

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,250
so I dropped him off 30 meters away from the subway station.

94
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,840
You must be tired. Are you okay to drive?

95
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,610
Yes.

96
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,980
So that was a shy revenge, right?

97
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,550
What?

98
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,980
N-No.

99
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,380
I think Artist Lee Seong Min knows we dated and is joking around.

100
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,100
I think he's just a peculiar person.

101
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,300
Don't let it bother you too much.

102
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,710
I can't help but be bothered if someone is interested in you.

103
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,710
I-Interested? No way.

104
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,120
It's not like that.

105
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,910
Can't you just mark him as spam?

106
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,010
What are you saying? The exhibit opens on Monday.

107
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,510
I have tons of stuff to manage.

108
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,910
I thought you were quitting. Why are you working so hard?

109
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,400
You said you were disappointed in me because I was irresponsible yesterday.

110
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,080
I wasn't disappointed.

111
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,460
I was jealous.

112
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,000
I haven't gotten over you at all.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,560
But you went on a blind date and went to eat with a guy right after work.

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,160
That makes it sound like I'm a terrible person.

115
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
Mr. Lee just followed me on his own, and the blind date-

116
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,160
I was told he was a headhunter.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,360
I went to look for a new job.

118
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,310
What?

119
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,360
I didn't know it was a blind date. I took a resume with me!

120
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,040
What?

121
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,610
Seriously.

122
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,100
I was so frustrated yesterday.

123
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,720
You were so cold to me and made me sad.

124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,330
Were you sad?

125
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,490
Because I was cold?

126
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,200
Honestly, it wasn't great.

127
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,280
I mean,

128
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,120
I don't understand how I feel, either.

129
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,200
I thought it would be fine for you to hate me.

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,730
But it was frustrating to be actually misunderstood.

131
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,810
I know we need to break up,

132
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,090
but I don't like it when you treat me coldly.

133
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,910
But...

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,540
we can't do this.

135
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,600
Why can't we?

136
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,800
We can't both keep holding onto our lingering feelings,

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,630
unable to get rid of them,

138
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,690
and stay like this.

139
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,730
But I'm going to keep living like this.

140
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,650
♫  Every scar, every tear  ♫

141
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not going to get rid of my feelings for you.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,120
I'll stay like this.

143
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,400
You told me before.

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,600
That you can live just fine without love.

145
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
But...

146
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,610
I don't want to live like that without you.

147
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,570
♫  You know, right?  ♫

148
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:33,140
♫  Fading you  ♫

149
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,960
Can't you just come to me?

150
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,750
♫  Like a fog  ♫

151
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:49,410
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

152
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,190
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

153
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,210
How many times do I have to tell you?

154
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,800
I've memorized this pattern since we broke up so many times.

155
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,820
Is it on repeat? Why are we always back to square one?

156
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,440
I-I think I'm not in my right mind because I haven't slept.

157
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,910
We can stop here. Let's go. Let's go...

158
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,760
   

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,060
 Did you get home okay? 

160
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,880
 I'll be at AL Card on Monday. 

161
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,070
 Let's get chicken that night. 

162
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,930
 I think it's so fun that we met like this. 

163
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,050
 It feels like fate. 

164
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,060
 Sure, but I don't know if it's good fate or bad fate. 

165
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,240
 Moving forward, please play ignorant about my relationship with the Director. 

166
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,060
I almost fell for it again.

167
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,620
Get it together, Ha Yun Seo.

168
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,970
He is no longer that idiot. He's the artist.

169
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,870
Artist.

170
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,690
Artist...

171
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
   

172
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,170
What is this? How dare you spend the night out?

173
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,200
I texted you last night.

174
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,180
There was a work emergency. I had to work all night.

175
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,250
Get out of the way.

176
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,330
For real, right?

177
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,500
You weren't with the weakling, right?

178
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,700
I was worried all night.

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,810
I heard he left home, too.

180
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,850
I thought you two might have eloped.

181
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,220
Elope? Please.

182
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,300
Get out before I give you a bloody nose.

183
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Nuna, be strong.

184
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,400
I know because I've seen too many melodramas.

185
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,500
It's catastrophic to marry into a family with insufferable in-laws.

186
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,100
As a senior in high school, are you proud of watching melodramas instead of studying?

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,430
Noona, has the weakling still not gone back home?

188
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,410
What?

189
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,710
If he left home,

190
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,230
is he still staying out somewhere?

191
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,110
I don't know.

192
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,540
See? See?

193
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,050
You look worried! You still have feelings for him!

194
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,700
Gosh, please. Get lost.

195
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Get lost, I said! Seriously.

196
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,630
Who is it?

197
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,800
 It's me. Open the door. 

198
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,630
Hyeong?

199
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,800
What brings you here?

200
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,600
Are you staying here like this?

201
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,710
What? Well...

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Take it.

203
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,140
Stop staying at hotels. Pick one of those places.

204
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,860
It's fine. I'll take care of myself.

205
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,160
How exactly will you take care of yourself?

206
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,200
Did you know there are rumors about you leaving home?

207
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,080
Director Seo Ju Won is out as an heir candidate for the line of succession.

208
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,200
- What? 
 - If you like her that much, hang onto her.

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,060
But since it hasn't worked out thus far, it must not be mutual.

210
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,140
Give it up if it's not working out. Go back to where you belong.

211
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,810
That was from Mother.

212
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,060
But to me, it looks like she wants you to come home instead of leaving.

213
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,320
 Hello. 

214
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,680
Yes, Mr. Lee. Hello.

215
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,410
Hello, Mr. Lee.

216
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,240
Mr. Lee, you heard, right?

217
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,490
There was a big crowd as soon as the gallery opened!

218
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,220
Well, I expected that.

219
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,270
I'm hot, you know.

220
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,120
Yes. You are.

221
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,410
Just last Friday, I thought we were in big trouble.

222
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,920
It's like the saying, "A blessing in disguise."

223
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,370
I don't know how we could ever repay your generosity.

224
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,990
It must not have been an easy decision. Thank you again.

225
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,300
Don't just thank me with words.

226
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,010
- Let's get some chicken and beer tonight. 
 - Sorry?

227
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,850
Aigoo, only chicken and beer? Let's get something more expensive.

228
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,700
With the AL Card's company card.

229
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,640
We'll treat him to a proper dinner, right?

230
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,610
Sure, sure. Of course.

231
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,600
Come on in. Your contract is ready.

232
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,330
Okay.

233
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,160
- Have this. 
 - Thank you.

234
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,000
 Right. Let's not mess up work because of personal feelings. 

235
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,710
   

236
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,940
Then we can proceed.

237
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,470
Don't you need to read it further?

238
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,600
I've read enough.

239
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
You know I majored in law.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,990
Didn't we see each other around campus?

241
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,000
You were famous for being a third-generation chaebol heir,

242
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,550
and I was famous for my looks.

243
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,960
I was also famous for my looks–

244
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,790
We will discuss this on our end

245
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,630
and send the signed contract.

246
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,170
See you at the staff dinner tonight.

247
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,580
Does the director attend the staff dinner, too?

248
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,900
- What do you mean? 
 - I'm just curious if it's for me,

249
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,120
or if it's to keep your eye on me.

250
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,400
Don't take it the wrong way.

251
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,910
You're Team Leader Ha Yun Seo's disaster alert.

252
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,240
Her ex-boyfriend.

253
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,280
That's why I was curious if you were over her.

254
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,100
Why are you curious about that?

255
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,870
Not sure.

256
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,920
Why would I be?

257
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,700
Yes.

258
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,120
Right now?

259
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,790
A last-minute meeting about the General Automobiles MOU signing deal came up.

260
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:27,200
The client happens to have plans in Korea and can meet in Jeju.

261
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,770
- So we're leaving in an hour, right? 
 - Yes.

262
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,250
 Right now? 

263
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,750
 I'll be right there. 

264
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,330
 I'm sorry. Something urgent has come up. 

265
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,470
 I'm interested in her. 

266
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,740
 Or maybe I'm curious about her. 

267
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,580
 I don't know how honest I should be with her ex-boyfriend, but... 

268
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,660
 She seems cold, but she has a funny side. 

269
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,810
 I also have something to thank her for. 

270
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,670
 Mr. Lee. 

271
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,420
 I inadvertently saw your texts to your ex-girlfriend. 

272
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,410
 It seems you went through a breakup recently as well. 

273
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,250
 How can you be so easily... 

274
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,200
 Those texts weren't for my ex-girlfriend. 

275
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,600
 I haven't been in a relationship in a long time. 

276
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,820
 I guess Team Leader Ha could think that, too. 

277
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,890
 I should tell her. 

278
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,220
- Hey, Seo Ju Won. 
 - Huh?

279
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,950
What?

280
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,200
Did you pay attention to what I said yesterday?

281
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't hang onto a relationship that's over. Focus on work.

282
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay.

283
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,770
 ­  

284
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,110
Gosh, it's nice to work with you!

285
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,620
Where's the director? He said he was coming.

286
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,900
Something came up. He went to Jeju on a business trip.

287
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,300
I see. Good.

288
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,470
Why are you staring at me like that?

289
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:34,120
I feel like you should be a celebrity instead of an artist.

290
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,250
Instead of landscapes, why don't you paint a self-portrait?

291
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,640
Gosh, no way.

292
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,210
No matter how hard I try, it won't capture how I look in real life.

293
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,950
That's right!

294
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,520
That's right.

295
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,820
- Excuse me, Mr. Lee. 
 - Yes.

296
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,670
We won't be seeing each other like this that much.

297
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,980
Let's take a picture.

298
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,700
- Sure, good idea. 
 - Yay.

299
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,330
- Me, too! 
 - Sure.

300
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,650
Team Leader, you should be in it, too. This is a rare opportunity.

301
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,380
I'm okay.

302
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,150
If we're not all in it, let's not bother taking one.

303
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,940
Team Leader!

304
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,030
Let's just take the photo.

305
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,380
- Get close. 
 - Okay, taking the picture!

306
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,980
One, two, three!

307
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,120
- Can I take one? 
 - Gosh, of course.

308
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,460
- Everyone get in. 
 - Okay.

309
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,640
Team Leader, you need to look at the camera.

310
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
Okay, two, three!

311
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,760
 ­  

312
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,740
 I thank you for your hard work. See you soon. 

313
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,670
Delighted to meet you.

314
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,270
 ­  

315
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,230
 ­  

316
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,250
- Good work. 
 - You, too, Hyeong.

317
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,980
   

318
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,980
- Mr. Kim. 
 - Yes.

319
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,970
- What time is our flight? 
 - In two hours. At 9 p.m.

320
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,300
In two hours...

321
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,270
it'll take three hours to Gimpo and four hours to Gangnam.

322
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,540
That won't work.

323
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,380
What won't work?

324
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,000
What is this photo?

325
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,810
Actually, there's a guy who's interested in Yun Seo.

326
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,110
What?

327
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,020
Let me see.

328
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,040
Isn't this Lee Seong Min? You asked me for his number so you could scout him.

329
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,470
Those two locked eyes in just a few days?

330
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,290
- That fast? 
 - They didn't lock eyes.

331
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,330
They're having a staff dinner.

332
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,360
Right. You said you knew someone close to him, right?

333
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,850
- Yes. 
 - What have you heard?

334
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,700
Do you know what kind of person he is?

335
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,530
Sort of.

336
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,500
He comes from a political family.

337
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,070
They set him up so he could carry on the lineage,

338
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,280
but he gave up a stable future to become a painter,

339
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,070
and the family flipped out.

340
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,210
He talked about cutting ties with them and left home–

341
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
He's just like you!

342
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,840
He left his family to pursue his passion for painting.

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,210
Maybe he's even worse than you.

344
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,420
Wow, this is not going to be an easy fight.

345
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,300
Never mind. Let's go.

346
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,820
 Hyeong, Yun Seo is so pretty, right? 

347
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,080
 Look! 

348
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,340
 Yes, she's pretty. Pretty. 

349
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,840
 Goodness... 

350
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,630
 You said cinemas are dark and cramped. 

351
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,010
 Going with Yun Seo makes it feel okay. 

352
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:08,200
 Yun Seo is acting strange. 

353
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,440
 Do you think I did something wrong? 

354
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,160
 I thought you might chase after Yun Seo, 

355
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,150
 but didn't expect you to reject working abroad. 

356
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,600
 Ju Won did like Yun Seo very much. 

357
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,630
Ju Won!

358
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,900
Wh-What's wrong?

359
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,510
I'll help you.

360
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,170
Who else would understand what you're feeling?

361
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,320
Hyeong, what are you doing? People are watching.

362
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
Seo Ju Won, listen to me.

363
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,700
I'll take on Mother's expectations as the oldest son so...

364
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:59,600
you live the life you want.

365
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,550
- Mr. Kim. 
 - Yes.

366
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,070
Please get a helicopter.

367
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,280
A helicopter? Why suddenly?

368
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Fly over there right now. Make your dreams come true.

369
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,450
Go to the staff dinner right now and get her.

370
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,080
Can I really do that?

371
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,040
Okay.

372
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,260
A propeller!

373
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,630
Cheers!

374
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,770
Chug!

375
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,770
You're supposed to chug.

376
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,890
♫  How long will you make me do a shoulder dance?  ♫

377
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,900
Chug, chug, chug!

378
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,470
Cheers!

379
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,870
Why don't we start wrapping up?

380
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,860
Mr. Lee has to go to Yeosu for the event tomorrow morning.

381
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,460
I think you've had a lot to drink.

382
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,870
- Well? I don't think I've had much. 
 - Come on. Seriously?

383
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,910
He says it's okay. Why do you keep being like that?

384
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,580
I wanted to run up the company card

385
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,930
so I ordered more meat and drinks on my way to the restroom.

386
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,790
I also got four more bowls of doenjang* stew and rice.
  (*Fermented soy paste) 

387
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,160
Our order must be here! Come in, deonjang rice!

388
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm going to clean out AL tonight. Don't stop me!

389
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,980
D-Director! Have a seat here!

390
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,390
I'm late.

391
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,940
You must have waited long.

392
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,480
How? We didn't know you were coming.

393
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,290
Didn't you go to Jeju?

394
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,320
Deputy Bae kept calling me, so I couldn't skip.

395
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,400
I did?

396
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,460
O-Of course.

397
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,000
Director, you can't miss such an important staff dinner.

398
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,870
That'd be nonsense. That's why I called you like crazy.

399
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,700
I forced myself to come for the sake of our teamwork. Go ahead and eat.

400
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,900
Yes, you did go out of your way, but welcome.

401
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:06,160
This looks great. Team Leader, please have some.

402
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,860
Sure.

403
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,690
I haven't had dinner because of the meeting.

404
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,760
Looks delicious.

405
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,330
Hot.

406
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,480
Yay! Success!

407
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,250
Let's do another round at this super hot bar.

408
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,580
What?

409
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,910
Director? Why are you here?

410
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,950
T-T-That...

411
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,370
Because I kept calling him, he came.

412
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,970
- I see. 
 - I'm sorry, but I can't go for the second round...

413
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,770
Why not?

414
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,740
Oh, right! You feel uncomfortable because of the director.

415
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,380
Come on. A staff dinner is an extension of work.

416
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,930
I know you broke up, but you should separate work from life.

417
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,870
Fine, I'll go.

418
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,040
- Let's go now. 
 - Hurray! Another round!

419
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,910
It's a super hot bar.

420
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,980
   

421
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,000
Yes, Mother.

422
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,610
 The deal will proceed, no problem. 

423
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,170
All right. Good job.

424
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,570
And how did it go with Ju Won?

425
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,480
- Ju Won? 
  - As the oldest son and his older brother, 

426
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,410
you need to help him not to keep wandering.

427
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,700
I know he left impulsively

428
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,120
but can't come home out of pride. He must be struggling.

429
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
Well, not sure about that.

430
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,710
I don't think he wants to come home yet.

431
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,120
Wh-What?

432
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,900
But still, as I said,

433
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,750
- appease him and talk to him. 
 -  Mother, that won't make a difference. 

434
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,350
I think it's best to wait until he cools down on his own.

435
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,500
 Mother, I'm naked right now. I might catch a cold. 

436
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,390
I'll call you later. Bye.

437
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,120
Wait!

438
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,270
Look at these boys!

439
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,510
A man carries the weight of being the oldest son.

440
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,060
That's Seo Si Won.

441
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,220
So cool.

442
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,180
Anyway, did he make it to the staff dinner?

443
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,780
He can't lose this.

444
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,830
I-It-It's not–

445
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:05,610
No, no! No. I can't. Don't get close. I'll leave.

446
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,870
I thought you were getting home late from Jeju.

447
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,350
Oh, that...

448
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,890
The planning suddenly changed, so I got home quickly on a helicopter.

449
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,810
By the way, I didn't mean to show you earlier.

450
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,240
I didn't close the door when I lived alone.

451
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,210
I got used to it and wasn't thinking.

452
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I'll be careful from now on.

453
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,750
All right. Since we're living together, let's be careful.

454
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,930
Okay.

455
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,380
I'm sorry I screamed earlier.

456
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,260
As soon as I opened the door, I saw flesh...

457
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,760
I was just shocked.

458
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,160
Wait, those pills...

459
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,190
Is that for when you've had a shock?

460
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,130
Can I have one, too?

461
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,440
I was really startled.

462
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,260
They're sleeping pills.

463
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,750
Sleeping pills.

464
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,450
Was it so shocking that you can't sleep?

465
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,290
It wasn't that impactful. I usually can't sleep.

466
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:38,070
I'll add "no nudity" to our new rules.

467
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,440
- Got it? 
 - Yes, yes. Oh, okay...

468
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,190
Over here!

469
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,820
Mr. Lee, over here.

470
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,510
- It's great here. You haven't been, right? 
 - Of course I have.

471
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,140
You've been? Of course, you have.

472
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,070
Director, are you sure I called you?

473
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,000
I don't see it on my call log.

474
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,410
Honestly, you came because you wanted to linger, right?

475
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,940
You wanted to drink with Team Leader Ha.

476
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

477
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,350
Hey! Wait for me!

478
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,990
Why are you doing this?

479
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,600
- What? 
 - You came because it was bothering you.

480
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,550
It's not like he likes me.

481
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,550
Why did you follow me all the way from Jeju-do? So extra!

482
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,340
Do you think I'm doing this for no reason?

483
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,170
What?

484
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Why aren't you two coming in?

485
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,040
Are you getting back together right now?

486
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,120
Get back together! Get back together!

487
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,280
I hope you get back together!

488
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,510
I'm sorry.

489
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,610
What do you mean? They're dating again!

490
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,120
Let's go.

491
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,800
And...

492
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,610
I think you know that I wouldn't do this for no reason.

493
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,890
It's so nice here.

494
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,220
- Right? You're glad we came, right? 
 - Totally.

495
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,260
All right. What should we drink?

496
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,370
- Cocktails? Whiskey? 
  - Let's do whiskey. 

497
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,610
Wow, both of you like whiskey.

498
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,810
You're totally synced.

499
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,530
What about food? The gambas or the cheese plate–

500
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,480
 The cheese plate. 

501
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,320
- You're synced again. 
 - I know, right?

502
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,540
You two should never go on a double-blind date together.

503
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,410
You'd be into the same girl.

504
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,100
I'll order whiskey and a cheese plate on my way to the restroom.

505
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,390
 I'll do it. 

506
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,550
I'll just go.

507
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,380
Excuse me.

508
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,240
Gosh, Director, don't drink so fast.

509
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,900
Say "ah."

510
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,440
Eat slowly.

511
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,450
Why not? They say the last one to arrive has to drink thrice.

512
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,320
He was late and didn't even do that.

513
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,610
Why don't I do it now?

514
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,870
Drink thrice as much.

515
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,010
Wow! A round of applause!

516
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,090
The director is a man of his word.

517
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,280
- Right? 
 - It's just three glasses of whiskey.

518
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,930
Are there people who can't drink that much?

519
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,700
- Then why don't you try? 
 - Sure. Why not?

520
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,530
So, Mr. Lee, do you have a girlfriend?

521
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,300
No, I haven't been in a relationship for a long time.

522
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,600
Maybe over three years?

523
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,010
But there's someone who thinks I had a breakup recently.

524
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,350
Anyway, it's been a while since I've dated anyone.

525
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,760
Oh, I see.

526
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,060
Then could I ask what type of a woman you're into?

527
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,540
Well...

528
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,830
I like someone cold but fun, charismatic yet unexpected.

529
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,690
Someone who is desperately making a living, doing her best every day.

530
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,220
Someone pretty like that.

531
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,900
 I need to end this gathering right now. 

532
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,630
All right.

533
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,960
Should we wrap this up?

534
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,460
Let's empty this one before we go.

535
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,960
Director, if you're tired, you can go home.

536
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,220
Me?

537
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,340
I think you're more tired. Why don't you go ahead?

538
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,360
I look tired? I think you are.

539
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,790
I can drink this all by myself.

540
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,300
 That was a truly weird night. 

541
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,200
 Ju Won, who's usually polite to everyone, lost his cool in front of this guy. 

542
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,500
I can drink this one and another bottle by myself.

543
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,440
 This strange man who appeared in front of us kept shaking us up. 

544
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,910
I can drink this one and two more bottles by myself.

545
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,760
- I can drink three. 
 - I can drink four.

546
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,220
I can drink five–

547
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,460
Enough. Everyone's had plenty to drink.

548
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,550
When I finish this, we're leaving.

549
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:20,110
 That night, strangely, I wanted to stop the night, the situation. 

550
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,880
- Chug! 
 - Daebak.

551
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,740
One more bottle!

552
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,500
 Eventually... 

553
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,410
 Cheers! 

554
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,860
Ma'am, one more bottle over here, please.

555
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,590
What... Where am I?

556
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,420
 Lee Seong Min's studio? 

557
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,680
Why am I here?

558
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,000
Oh?

559
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,020
 What? What happened? 

560
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,970
 Be careful! Be careful! Be careful! 

561
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,290
 Sorry, sorry. I'm usually not such a lightweight. 

562
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,990
 I drank too fast. I'm so drunk. 

563
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,300
 Wow. You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen. 

564
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,070
 Is that why you can't forget me? Because I'm so pretty? 

565
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,660
 - Am I that attractive? 
 - Of course! 

566
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,180
 But I'm not so bad, either, right? 

567
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,440
 I'm handsome, tall, rich, and young. 

568
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,180
 Why do you keep breaking up with me? 

569
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,060
 You should be just a little handsome, tall, and rich. 

570
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,000
 But why are you so attractive? Huh? 

571
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,050
 You're such hotties. What are we going to do? 

572
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,740
Are you awake, hotties?

573
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Good morning!

574
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,170
It's so nice in here. All this natural light!

575
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,990
R-Right. This futon is more comfortable than my bed.

576
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,380
Daebak!

577
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,300
You must be embarrassed since you're rambling on.

578
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,760
Yes.

579
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,860
I'm embarrassed. I'm so embarrassed I could die!

580
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,800
Right. You should be.

581
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,520
Aigoo, you were both acting so drunk last night.

582
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,510
No. I mean, you two.

583
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,300
Why did you act like that last night?

584
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,170
What? What did we do?

585
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,000
You two created a weird vibe at the staff dinner.

586
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,980
I was trying to wrap it up and ended up this way.

587
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,560
I mean, a drinking competition? Who does something so foolish?

588
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,100
Why can't you two just get along? Why can't you do that?

589
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,750
Why did you have to create this situation? Why?

590
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,690
You think this is our fault?

591
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,540
I'm sorry.

592
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,890
Anyway, please don't create this kind of situation again.

593
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,610
I'm heading out.

594
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm hungover.

595
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,510
Are you hungover?

596
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,640
Want to get some pizza? Let's get pizza and then go to work.

597
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,410
Pizza for a hangover?

598
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,470
Want to go get some bean sprout soup and rice?

599
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:26,130
No thanks. Let's take care of our own hangovers.

600
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,800
Thank you for everything.

601
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,210
Gosh...

602
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,480
Yun Seo.

603
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,610
Can we talk for a minute?

604
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,070
Can we talk later?

605
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,300
I have a headache.

606
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,000
Is it bad? Want me to drive you? Or get meds?

607
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,470
No, it's not that bad.

608
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,850
See you at the office.

609
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,700
   

610
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,210
- I'll take this. 
 - Let me ring you up.

611
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,250
I'm sorry. I left my wallet at home...

612
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,970
I'll come back.

613
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,340
Hottie! Wait for me!

614
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,310
Aren't you thankful I brought your wallet?

615
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,450
Then let's go take care of our hangovers. We can have our soup and rice today.

616
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,810
I need to go home and go to work.

617
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,860
Just tell them you're meeting with me.

618
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,830
Then you can show up late.

619
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,600
Soup and rice plus a hangover drink?

620
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,090
Why are you doing this?

621
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,950
What did I do?

622
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,500
Maybe you find it entertaining that I can't get over my ex-boyfriend

623
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,960
while working in the same space. But not me.

624
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,660
So why are you toying with someone else's pain?

625
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,100
- I'm just glad we've met like this. 
 - I'm not.

626
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,880
I'm ashamed that

627
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,920
someone I just want to work with knows about my ex and my feelings.

628
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,120
In the car, at the staff dinner last night...

629
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,670
Pretending to be close to me to provoke him...

630
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,140
I think you're crossing the line. It makes me mad.

631
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,680
You speak so coldly.

632
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,010
I don't need to be warm toward you

633
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,060
so please stop toying with me like this.

634
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,360
I'm already overwhelmed and struggling without it.

635
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,370
Yes.

636
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,700
You know I'm going to Paris for a week today, right?

637
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,400
Yes. You texted me your schedule.

638
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,310
Have breakfast before you go. Let's eat together as a family.

639
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,830
Okay, sure.

640
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,500
Two bundles of scallions plus two bags of rice.

641
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,840
That's correct, sir. I'll send the money right away.

642
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,670
Thank you, CEO.

643
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,560
I'm not the CEO.

644
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,180
My niece over here is the CEO.

645
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,090
I'm just an employee. A very lowly—

646
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,210
Oh, Yun Seo!

647
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,090
What? What are you doing here?

648
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,650
Why are you here instead of going to work at this hour?

649
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,750
Yi Rae.

650
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,500
- My stomach hurts. 
 - What?

651
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Did you leave home early, or did you not go home at all?

652
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,030
- Go away. 
 - Okay.

653
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,320
- Take your time. 
 - Okay.

654
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,780
What's going on?

655
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,570
Did you actually drink all night and not go home?

656
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,040
Yes. I need to eat this and go.

657
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,210
Why didn't you grab some soup near the office?

658
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,950
Just because.

659
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:07,960
- I wanted to see you. 
 - Ew.

660
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,890
What is it?

661
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,800
It's just hard.

662
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,300
What is? Breaking up?

663
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,290
Yes.

664
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,180
I don't know what I'm feeling.

665
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,800
I don't understand myself.

666
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,170
It's so painful.

667
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:51,580
♫  You already reside in me like this  ♫

668
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:56,380
 When he's cold toward me, it's hard to see that. 

669
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:00,900
 When I see him care for me as always, 

670
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,500
 I think it's immature, but I'm relieved without even realizing it. 

671
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,590
♫  Throughout this long while  ♫

672
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,270
♫  My heart should fade  ♫

673
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,680
 I can't let go of him. 

674
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,540
 But I can't hold on to him, either. 

675
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,170
 My heart keeps breaking into pieces. 

676
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:32,850
♫  You come to me again and make me cry  ♫

677
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,490
What is all this?

678
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,040
Madam asked us to prepare them.

679
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,500
This is so much for a family breakfast.

680
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,430
Wait...

681
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,460
Did she fall for me after seeing me last night?

682
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,300
A guy like me.

683
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,100
Mother?

684
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,030
What brings you here, Mother?

685
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,940
Didn't you know I was coming?

686
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,990
- Didn't you tell him? 
 - I did.

687
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:28,270
I told you. Breakfast as a family.

688
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,510
This is what you meant by "family."

689
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,980
- Have a seat. 
 - Sure.

690
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,800
It's strange to have you here for breakfast.

691
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,500
Well, it doesn't feel familiar to me, either.

692
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,080
So what's going on?

693
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,090
Nothing.

694
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,990
It's hard for me to make time in the evening.

695
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,520
I wanted to say hello to her before I left for Paris.

696
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,720
Do you know how Ju Won left home?

697
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,770
I thought she might be lonely in that big house by herself.

698
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,230
I was worried.

699
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,650
Do you...

700
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:21,450
not find me difficult?

701
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,700
I do.

702
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,790
But I don't feel uncomfortable around you.

703
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,320
I want to have a good relationship with you.

704
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,450
You're my role model.

705
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,720
I knew you two were similar.

706
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,120
Sometimes I get chills because it's uncanny-

707
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,050
- Could I come by sometime for advice? 
 - Sure.

708
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,820
- Do that. 
 - Yes, Mother.

709
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:57,560
Also, I don't know why Ju Won left home exactly, but...

710
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,950
Hey.

711
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,260
Lee Mi Jin.

712
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,770
I know because I must do what I want to do.

713
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,670
He has to fight until the end, so he has no regrets later.

714
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,810
Someday, he'll see where you're coming from.

715
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,240
Take care of Mother until Ju Won is back.

716
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,330
Have meals with her.

717
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,720
Okay. I should.

718
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,500
Don't team up against her.

719
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,860
Yes. Of course not!

720
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,610
Give me your hands.

721
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:45,770
What is it? Oh?

722
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,320
What?

723
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,700
Mother, Si Won got this for you.

724
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,300
Yes. I got it for you.

725
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,970
We just got it in at the department store. It'll give you energy.

726
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,170
   

727
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,920
Oh, yes.

728
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,970
Let me give you one.

729
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,440
Here.

730
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,500
Pretty good.

731
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,550
- Thanks. 
 - Of course.

732
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,400
What are you doing?

733
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,610
Getting ready to leave. Why?

734
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,150
Well...

735
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:59,140
Thanks for today.

736
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,240
I just see my mother as a strong person.

737
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,310
I didn't think she'd be lonely.

738
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,950
Strong people get lonely, too.

739
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,660
Your father has been abroad for years.

740
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,090
She must feel so alone in that big house.

741
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,300
Here.

742
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,770
Read it if you can't sleep.

743
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,050
   

744
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,940
What is it now?

745
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,470
Cuddle with it when you sleep.

746
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:44,700
A stuffed animal?

747
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,090
Well, a subcontractor gifted it to us.

748
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,220
You can have it.

749
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,340
If you hug something soft, you fall asleep easily.

750
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:01,570
Have a good trip.

751
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,180
 Sleep tight every night. 

752
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,840
Hey.

753
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:24,160
Thanks a lot for giving me Lee Seong Min's number last time.

754
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,210
I meant to ask if you want to grab dinner.

755
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:28,300
How's next week—

756
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,970
Yes.

757
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,910
What did you say?

758
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,410
Vice Chairman!

759
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,420
What? I told you not to come here.

760
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,870
There's a problem.

761
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,010
   

762
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:54,040
   

763
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,500
Did you know about Artist Lee Seong Min's background, Director?

764
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,880
I found out recently as well.

765
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,320
We went to school together, but we didn't know each other well.

766
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,750
Vice Chairman connected us through a friend.

767
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,750
But it wasn't special treatment. Why is it a problem?

768
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,550
I thought so, too.

769
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,180
But it may look political for our group.

770
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,500
You and I should handle this.

771
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,250
Team Leader, please get a plan ready for the press.

772
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:28,200
- I understand. 
 - I have something else to tell you.

773
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:33,100
Take care.

774
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,770
Team Leader.

775
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,400
Vice Chairman was here because of the news, right?

776
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,400
- Yes. 
 - What do we do?

777
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,330
Is this job cursed?

778
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,110
After Artist Park Jong Seo, and now Lee Seong Min, too?

779
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,770
Team Leader, look at this. People are gleeful.

780
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:57,160
Saying that Lee Seong Min's team leaked the news about Park Jong Seo,

781
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,950
that he got in through nepotism, and that his paintings are bad.

782
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,070
They're awful.

783
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,800
Please prepare materials for the press.

784
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,720
Cancel the "Meet the Artist" event that was scheduled today.

785
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,300
- I'm going down to the gallery. 
 - What?

786
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,550
The gallery? All the way to Yeosu?

787
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,790
Yes. Reporters might swarm the place.

788
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:22,320
I think I should go there myself and handle it.

789
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,450
 Team Leader, I have something else to tell you. 

790
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:38,750
 I know that Artist Lee Seong Min is estranged from his family. 

791
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:42,680
 He might be sensitive about this news coming out. 

792
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,920
 It's personal so I don't want to say more details. 

793
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,650
 But I thought you should know. 

794
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,630
   

795
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:52,660
   

796
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:03,680
Is he just going to ghost me, or what?

797
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,580
Are you okay?

798
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,660
Are you here because you're worried I might not be?

799
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,580
Of course. We brought you in,

800
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,210
and you came all the way here, but the event got canceled.

801
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,660
Plus, reporters might be swarming the place.

802
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,720
Of course, I should take care of you.

803
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,870
How dependable.

804
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,420
But it should be okay now.

805
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,870
- My father's camp released a rebuttal. 
 - What?

806
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,140
"It's true that Assemblyman Lee Gyeong Seok's son is the Artist Lee Seong Min,"

807
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,680
"but it was not special treatment."

808
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,200
"Artist Lee changed his career path abruptly during law school."

809
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,070
"Due to this conflict, the father and son have not stayed in contact."

810
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,610
"Assemblyman Lee only learned about the exhibit today."

811
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,470
"While it may be late, he supports his son in pursuing his dreams."

812
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:57,890
"He is planning to attend the exhibit soon."

813
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,260
Isn't this TMI?

814
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,180
I'm in a weird mood,

815
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,800
the event is canceled, and I'm here.

816
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,700
Do you want to go to the beach?

817
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:30,450
It's weird to have the world see what I didn't want to reveal.

818
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,230
I understand.

819
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:37,190
You didn't voluntarily reveal your wound, but someone else did.

820
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,690
It makes sense that you're upset.

821
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,500
What?

822
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,130
Are you really Team Leader Ha Yun Seo?

823
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:51,570
Why are you so warm toward me? I thought you had no reason to be.

824
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,420
I'm sorry about everything.

825
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,120
But I actually have something to thank you for.

826
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,530
What?

827
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,740
Assemblyman Lee Gyeong Seok.

828
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,060
He pretends to be a pacifist,

829
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,800
but he's a violent person.

830
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:13,510
What?

831
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,400
He didn't just do it to his family.

832
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,690
He laid hands on people around him.

833
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,910
When he found out one of his aides helped me start painting...

834
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,920
 What is this? Die! 

835
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,800
 He made sure he couldn't stay in politics. 
   

836
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,200
I cut off contact with Father after that,

837
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,800
but I got a postcard from the aide recently.

838
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,090
He told me to do what I wanted to do and be well.

839
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:45,040
I didn't know if I could even apologize.

840
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,670
I couldn't bring myself to.

841
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:52,840
I mustered up the courage to track down his number, but it was wrong.

842
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,040
That's why I started contacting you.

843
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,660
So those texts...

844
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,450
I ruined a person's life.

845
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:07,380
And I thought, "Can I really start painting again?"

846
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,150
"Is it okay for me to be well?" Right as I was feeling confused,

847
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:14,970
I heard your voice that day.

848
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,550
  
  

849
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:57,530
 Hey! Why are you driving like that? 

850
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:00,350
 You did an illegal U-turn first! 

851
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,260
 Look at you, you young thing! 

852
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,690
 Thanks for calling me young, but I'm not that young. 

853
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:09,920
 Even if I were, you can't speak to someone like that. 

854
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,730
 It's so tough to make a living so I worked when others were relaxing. 

855
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,090
 Do you even know how deep labor is in my DNA? 

856
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:21,710
 So between two people who are desperate to make a living, let's stop fighting. 

857
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,320
 At that moment, 

858
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,560
 I felt like I was in a different world. 

859
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,190
 The voice on the other side of the phone was full of life. 

860
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,510
 Even though she said her life was exhausting, 

861
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,460
 I could feel her will to live. 

862
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,900
   

863
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,500
   
   

864
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,530
 That's why I wanted to meet you. 

865
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,570
Anyway,

866
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,500
I just wanted to meet you and tell you.

867
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:01,500
It was nice to meet you. And I thought that meant I was interested.

868
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:06,500
I was swept up in my own feelings and put you in an awkward position.

869
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,440
I'm sorry.

870
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,760
Now that the news is out, I'm giving you my excuse.

871
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,990
You seemed very upset this morning.

872
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,200
Well...

873
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,040
I've been feeling confused lately, too.

874
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,270
I want to break up with him.

875
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,260
I have to.

876
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,540
But it's easier said than done.

877
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:38,450
I may have been taking it out on you.

878
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:47,700
I feel empty, inside out. Should we go get some hot gukbap.

879
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,010
Besides soup and rice,

880
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,010
there's something I do when I feel empty inside.

881
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,780
Do you want to do that together today?

882
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,710
When you feel empty inside,

883
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:27,500
do you come outside to paint?

884
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,890
Painting is good,

885
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:34,320
but before I start,

886
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,180
I like the time I spend looking at the landscape.

887
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,310
If you focus on nature,

888
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:46,230
you can hear sounds you don't usually hear.

889
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,120
That makes me feel calm.

890
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,160
That's why I started painting landscapes.

891
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,280
You're way...

892
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:11,000
worse than I thought you'd be.

893
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,400
Excuse me?

894
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,080
Why are you laughing?

895
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,300
It's just so cute.

896
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,360
I'll still give you a compliment.

897
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,760
For your first time, you did well.

898
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,600
Then let me give you a compliment, too.

899
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,890
It seems like you've been through a lot.

900
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:39,460
But you've achieved your dream.

901
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,540
I respect that.

902
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:46,540
So I almost felt proud of you.

903
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,500
Enough to give you a pat on the back.

904
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,650
Then pat me on the back.

905
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,500
That's just a saying.

906
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,200
Words are not enough for me.

907
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,850
Pat me on the back.

908
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,090
Tell me I went through a lot.

909
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,370
That I'm doing a good job.

910
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,420
You've done so much.

911
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,910
You're doing a good job.

912
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,800
 ­  

913
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,710
I thought you wanted a pat on your back.

914
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:16,680


915
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,660
  ­ 

916
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:36,000
♫  The more I get to know ya, can't tell the feelings I feel  ♫

 - If you really want her back... 
 - Let her go now and get her later. 

924
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:10,050
 The first thing you need to do is move your office. 

925
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:12,430
 I think it's really over. Over! 

926
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,700
 Is he really trying to get over me? 

927
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,410
 From now on, I'm a bad guy. 

928
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:20,820
 The strategy is jealousy. 

929
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,250
 That jealousy, that primal feeling. 

930
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:25,980
 Yun Seo has to feel it to know how precious you are. 

931
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,520
 When I'm struggling, I keep thinking of him.

01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,690
