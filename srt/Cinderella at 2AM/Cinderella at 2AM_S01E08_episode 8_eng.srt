1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,290
   

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,380
   

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,270
   

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,940
   

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,240
   

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,980


7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,060
   

8
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,150
 My childhood was nothing but sad. 

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,280
 Help me! 

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,290
 All I remember is getting hit and crying. 

11
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,400
 ­  

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,800
 Even if I got perfect test scores, I never got praised. 

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,080
 I was able to hold out with the only hope of leaving home. 

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
 You annoying little brat. 

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,400
 To me, parents were like unforgettable nightmares. 

16
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,270
 But now... 

17
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,530
 that nightmare... 

18
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,900
 is asleep forever. 

19
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,970
 I was sad. 

20
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,110
 Why couldn't my family be happy like others? 

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,610
 Even if we were ordinary, 

22
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,250
 it would have been wonderful. 

23
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,030
 Then... 

24
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,560
 I could have been a good daughter. 

25
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,080
   

26
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,720
How did you know?

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,130
Ji Seok called me.

28
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,620
He asked me to stay by your side.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,510
Yun Seo. Yun Seo!

30
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,310
Let go of me!

31
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,510
Why are you here?

32
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,540
Who are you to come all the way here? Why?

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,330
Yun Seo.

34
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,960
I don't know how much you've heard,

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,160
but not every family is the same.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,400
I don't consider that woman my mother.

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,770
I'm not sad at all.

38
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,650
So go.

39
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,210
Go!

40
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,310
So why are you crying?

41
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,480
You say you're not sad.

42
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,210
I don't know.

43
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,630
I don't know...

44
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,420
 ­  

45
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,960
 I always tried not to feel pity for myself. 

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,800
 But in his arms, 

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,300
 I suddenly felt so sorry for myself. 

48
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,740
 That's why I cried. 

49
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,970
 Not because I was sad about my mother's death, 

50
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,720
 but because I felt so sorry for myself. 

51
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,500
I'm embarrassed.

52
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,600
What?

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,000
I said I was embarrassed for crying like that.

54
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,840
How much did you hear?

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,340
Just roughly.

56
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,550
Why you and Ji Seok ended up living by yourselves.

57
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,430
Then you must know...

58
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,870
that I haven't had an easy life.

59
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,960
I think that's why

60
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
I was obsessed with the idea of a happy family.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,710
Because my own childhood...

62
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,220
was always so shabby.

63
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,050
Shabby?

64
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:42,530
It must have been harder than I could ever imagine.

65
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,320
But you survived that life and stayed strong. You're amazing.

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,910
I've always thought that.

67
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,330
 Everything was handed to me from the moment I was born. 

68
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,040
   

69
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
   

70
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,620
Deputy– I mean, Team Leader!

71
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,480
- Congratulations. 
 - M-Me?

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,860
You got promoted!

73
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,490
Applause!

74
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,280
 I respected you for accomplishing everything on your own. 

75
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm sorry I showed up out of the blue today.

76
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,330
I knew you might hate it, but...

77
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,330
I thought you might be having a hard time.

78
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,240
I didn't want you to be alone. That's why I came.

79
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,410
I know.

80
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,620
Thank you.

81
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,130
It helped.

82
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,030
Let's go. I'm cold.

83
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,920
Okay.

84
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,980
Yun Seo, let's get married.

85
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,160
Let's get married.

86
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,450
I'm grateful you were born.

87
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,160
Meeting you feels like a miracle.

88
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,940
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.

89
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,380
   

90
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,910
 Let's get married. 

91
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,440
 Yun Seo, let's get married. 

92
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,810
Well...

93
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,470
this is so sudden.

94
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,930
It's not sudden for me.

95
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,280
I've thought about it every day.

96
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,990
♫  I keep looking at you  ♫

97
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,910
You must need time to think about it.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,340
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

99
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,100
Don't answer right now.

100
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,610
Take your time thinking about it as much as you want

101
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,670
and tell me.

102
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
♫  I'll be on your side  ♫

103
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,960
♫  Trust me again  ♫

104
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,010
♫  I'll become your ground  ♫

105
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:36,590
♫  I'll become solid, if you don't mind  ♫

106
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,260
What's with Yun Seo now?

107
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,000
You said she exhausts herself physically to distract herself from worries.

108
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
Is that what's happening?

109
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,370
Probably.

110
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,970
I thought she was okay for a while...

111
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,780
Ha Yun Seo.

112
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,470
Let's talk.

113
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,590
- What? I need to finish... 
 - Give it to me.

114
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,620
Stop making your body suffer when your heart is hurting.

115
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,700
It seems like something serious happened.

116
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,180
Is it really over?

117
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,450
- He asked me to marry him. 
 - What?

118
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,280
Really?

119
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,390
I can't figure you guys out.

120
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,380
Suddenly, he's a chaebol. Suddenly, you break up.

121
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,070
Suddenly, he's at your house. Now marriage?

122
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,760
So?

123
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,810
What did you say?

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,290
I'm thinking about it.

125
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,650
Ha Yun Seo. I know his family is a big deal,

126
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,040
but you love each other so much.

127
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,900
But marriage isn't just about love.

128
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,710
If our marriage plans become public, there will be press.

129
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,770
They'll say, "Who's that average person marrying a chaebol?"

130
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,650
They'll dig up my personal information and gossip about it.

131
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,580
In the process...

132
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm afraid it would hurt Ji Seok.

133
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm scared.

134
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,270
You've imagined so many things.

135
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,100
Relying on each other for what we lack.

136
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,440
Comforting each other when we're in pain.

137
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,200
I thought marriage was about leaning on each other.

138
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:54,390
But I don't know what I can do for Ju Won.

139
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,230
So...

140
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,790
that's why I couldn't answer him right away.

141
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,070
 What? 

142
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,780
- You proposed? 
 - Yes.

143
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,560
Wow. You're amazing, my little brother.

144
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,730
You're getting married despite our mother's disapproval.

145
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,310
We're not getting married. I just asked her.

146
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,200
That's the same thing.

147
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,530
I don't think I can let Yun Seo be alone anymore.

148
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,570
Look at you. You left Mother alone and left home.

149
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,780
I'm going back soon.

150
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,540
I'll convince her instead of running away.

151
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,190
But I don't know if you can.

152
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,820
Could you be more positive?

153
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,320
Sorry.

154
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,750
So when is Yun Seo going to give you an answer?

155
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,380
I don't know.

156
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,860
But I'm not going to push.

157
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,880
Until she's had time to think about it slowly and carefully,

158
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,130
I'll wait, no matter how long it takes.

159
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,540
 Her facial expression isn't good. 

160
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,210
 She's not feeling negative about marriage, right? 

161
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,580
No, no. Let's not do this.

162
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,150
Give her plenty of time.

163
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,480
But how long has it been?

164
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,730
It's only been an hour since she came to work?

165
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,730
Why is time passing so slowly?

166
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,800
Hyeong, do you like day drinking?

167
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,100
Want to take the rest of the day off and drink?

168
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,600
Did you drink already? What are you talking about?

169
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,310
No. The time is passing too slowly.

170
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,020
I want to sleep, but I can't fall asleep.

171
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,690
Let's drink.

172
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,280
Get out of here. I need to work.

173
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,900
Hyeong, can you hit me with this once?

174
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,040
What?

175
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,560
I'll just pass out. Wake me up if Yun Seo texts me.

176
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,750
Never mind.

177
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,010
   

178
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,160
Should you hit me with this to knock me out?

179
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,100
Are you out of your mind?

180
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,000
- Hyeong. 
 - Go away!

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,770
Go away!

182
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:21,350
- Great work, everybody. 
  - Thank you. 

183
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,910
 Hyeong, can you go camping with me this weekend? 

184
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,290
Seo Ju Won, seriously...

185
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,620
He said he'd wait for her answer.

186
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,570
I guess it's easier said than done.

187
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,120
   

188
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,280
Hello? I just got out of a meeting.

189
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,290
What's up?

190
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,430
I'm in your lobby. I have an urgent meeting.

191
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,620
 An urgent meeting? 

192
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,370
What do you need to discuss urgently at our company?

193
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,970
The executive office is in emergency mode about your face being on social media.

194
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,330
Your mother is coming up, too.

195
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,740
Wh-Wh-What did you say?

196
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,200
You.

197
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,150
Are you starting to use social media?

198
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,020
Just on my wife's social media.

199
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,190
Just this much, Mother.

200
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,080
I was in the background like furniture.

201
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,880
I know what you're concerned about,

202
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,700
but the responses aren't as negative as before.

203
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,230
"They look good together. He seems friendly. They're so relatable."

204
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,080
That kind of thing.

205
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,400
But moving forward, I'll try not to be in the background.

206
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,090
There's no need.

207
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,640
Moving forward, be in the foreground, not the background.

208
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,890
What?

209
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,720
Thanks to that photo, gossip about our marriage being fake

210
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,670
or that we're getting a divorce, disappeared.

211
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,780
There's even gossip that

212
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,660
AL Production is expanding through our being together,

213
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,810
and AL Production and my department store's stocks rose!

214
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,760
- R-Really? 
 - Yes!

215
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,680
Congratulations! You're unbanned from social media as of today.

216
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,300
Right, Mother?

217
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,300
You didn't have to...

218
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
- I'm heading out. 
 - Okay.

219
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,580
Bye.

220
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,160
- Are you happy? 
 - Yes.

221
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,590
You look really happy.

222
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,130
Hearing that...

223
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,700
I did something good for the company makes me glad.

224
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,480
I feel responsible.

225
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,620
That's the vice chairman mindset.

226
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,210
It's all for their own good.

227
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,680
But Ju Won, that kid...

228
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,660
You're keeping an eye on Ju Won, right?

229
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,790
Oh... C-Chairwoman, well...

230
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,460
Did something happen?

231
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,930
Director, thank you so much for lunch.

232
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,690
Sure.

233
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,870
You get along with us so naturally

234
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,050
that I keep forgetting that you're the Chairwoman's son.

235
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,000
We need to talk.

236
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Wow, daebak.

237
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,960
I've never seen the Chairwoman up that close.

238
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,790
She's the queen of charisma! Right?

239
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,630
I-I'm in total shock.

240
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,770
What are you doing?

241
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,760
I'm going to marry her.

242
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,060
You just decided that on your own and announced it?

243
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,480
That's what you've always done.

244
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,790
I was going to tell you once it was confirmed.

245
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm coming home tonight. I'll explain it to you then.

246
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,530
No need to come home. Go to Spain.

247
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,480
- Pardon? 
 - You said you wanted to go.

248
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,090
You said no.

249
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,900
I heard she gave her notice.

250
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,750
I don't want to be childish like this,

251
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,170
but if you're going to do this, Ha Yun Seo

252
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,580
will be unable to go anywhere.

253
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,400
- Here are the materials on Spanish financial laws. 
 - Good job.

254
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,420
But why is the director going to Spain all of a sudden?

255
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,340
There's been talks of him going abroad before.

256
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,550
Is that all?

257
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,340
The chairwoman wanted an arranged marriage, but she couldn't get her way.

258
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,420
Really? Is Director Seo Ju Won going to Spain?

259
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,610
That's what I'm saying!

260
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,940
She wanted to marry him off in an arranged marriage, but he had a girlfriend.

261
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,610
So he's being exiled to Spain.

262
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:24,940
Daebak. That girlfriend doesn't work here, right?

263
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,100
No way. Impossible.

264
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,430
Daebak!

265
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,620
Big news!

266
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,800
Bigger than seeing the chairwoman's face from 50cm away?

267
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,080
The director is being transferred to Spain.

268
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,440
What? Why all of a sudden?

269
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,810
The chairwoman sat the team leader down and told her to break up, right?

270
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,120
But since they can't end it,

271
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,740
I think the chairwoman is pissed off and sending him to Spain.

272
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,510
- Really? 
 - Yes!

273
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,640
True. The chairwoman is pressuring him.

274
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Team Leader doesn't know what she wants.

275
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,130
I'd want to leave Korea, too.

276
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,430
As a sunbae in life, it breaks my heart to see him like that.

277
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,550
 I heard you're going to Spain. 

278
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,460
 Is it true? 

279
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,130
If he says it is, what am I going to do?

280
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,130
Do I have the courage to tell him not to go?

281
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,890
I'll pick a few candidates for the

282
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,270
artist support project and share it with you.

283
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,840
- Got it. 
 - Okay.

284
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,910
By the way, thanks for listening to my story the other day.

285
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,790
You listened to my story, too.

286
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,210
Let's call it even.

287
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,280
- Sounds good. 
 - By the way,

288
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,770
did you know I called up Seo Ju Won that night?

289
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,440
Really? I thought I called him.

290
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,560
It was me. You missed him so much and kept calling for him.

291
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,310
You were having a hard time, so I called him up.

292
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,250
I-I was?

293
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,430
So what happened with you two?

294
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,680
Seo Ju Won is being transferred to Spain.

295
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,230
What?

296
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,050
I'm heading out.

297
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,490
 What is the problem? 

298
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,340
It's so clear that you two like each other,

299
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,880
I can't even get in between you two.

300
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,670
Why are you breaking up?

301
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,300
Do you know...

302
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:03,860
why Cinderella runs away before midnight?

303
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,540
All of a sudden?

304
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,690
Because she doesn't want to look ugly in front of the person she loves.

305
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,890
Without her beautiful dress and pumpkin carriage, she feels so shabby.

306
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,990
But still,

307
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,990
the prince shows up the next day with her glass slipper

308
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,680
and her life does a 180.

309
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:33,440
What do you think she thought about before he got there?

310
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,670
Starting at around 2 a.m.

311
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,710
until the next morning when the prince arrived,

312
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,900
it must have been the most difficult time for Cinderella.

313
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:53,200
And for me, those difficult hours will continue for a long time.

314
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,430
But I think...

315
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,190
if Ha Yun Seo was Cinderella,

316
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,830
she wouldn't be sitting around like that at 2 a.m.

317
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,620
You kept sending me proposals even after I had said no countless times.

318
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,990
Ha Yun Seo, who told a rude stranger,

319
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:17,030
"Let's not do this between people desperate to make a living."

320
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,930
I think she'd be a different kind of Cinderella.

321
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,560
If she missed the prince, she would go to the castle where he is.

322
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,160
There's no such thing

323
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,370
as a choice that guarantees happiness.

324
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,370
All right. I think I've done all I can.

325
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,530
Darn. I thought I was the prince,

326
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,020
but I'm the fairy godmother.

327
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,690
 I suddenly have to go to Spain. I'm leaving right now. 

328
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,000
 I'll call you once things are settled. Take care. 

329
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,390
Is that today?

330
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,630
   

331
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,820
 The moment I realized he wouldn't be near me all of a sudden, 

332
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,030
 I thought of images of him 

333
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,060
 working hard for a happiness that wasn't guaranteed. 

334
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,800
 From now on, I'll cling to you. 

335
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,580
 Will you really break up with me? 

336
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,960
 Don't you like me anymore? 

337
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,130
 I thought, on a tough day, 

338
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,680
 you might need someone to lean on. 

339
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,020
 All I have now is you. 

340
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,340
♫  Fading you  ♫

341
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,330
 Let's get married. 

342
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,280
 In reality, I wanted to answer many times. 

343
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,830
 I knew he would wait for me, 

344
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,300
 but I couldn't say anything. 

345
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,170
 I was frustrated and hated myself. 

346
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:37,540
 But if this is the last bit of time I have... 

347
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,980
♫  I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

348
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:51,820
♫  Shining you  ♫

349
00:26:51,820 --> 00:27:00,570
♫  Shining you, like a starlight  ♫

350
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:08,090
♫  When I look at it, follow it, it's shining on you  ♫

351
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:17,200
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫

352
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,730
Seo Ju Won!

353
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,160
How did you get here?

354
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,440
I thought it might be now or never.

355
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,960
If time passes, I might want to run away again.

356
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,720
I've been pushing you away all this time

357
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,800
because I was scared.

358
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,690
Because I may not be the right answer for you.

359
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,300
- Yun Seo... 
 - But...

360
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,180
I don't want to run away anymore.

361
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,930
I like you.

362
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,420
I can't be without you.

363
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,900
Am I too late?

364
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,450
Then I'll cling to you now.

365
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,430
From now on,

366
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,070
I'm going to chase after you.

367
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,400
Vice Chairman, how...

368
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,020
I didn't mean to see that. I was seeing Ju Won off.

369
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,780
But I happened to see this piping hot–

370
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,440
I mean, this moving scene. I'm glad.

371
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,460
Can you go now?

372
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,870
Okay. I will.

373
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,000
Here.

374
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,640
Just wait five days. Ju Won will be back.

375
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,250
Pardon?

376
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,300
Five days?

377
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
Yes. It's too long, right?

378
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,480
So you're not being transferred abroad?

379
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,550
- No. 
 - What?

380
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,050
How did that...

381
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,870
 If you're going to do this, Ha Yun Seo will be unable to go anywhere. 

382
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,850
 Do you want to make sure she has nowhere to go because of you? 

383
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,400
 Why would Yun Seo have nowhere to go? 

384
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,790
 She can be by my side. 

385
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,150
 I know the Spain deal is important to you, 

386
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,560
 so I'll go handle it. 

387
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,530
 We can talk when I come back. 

388
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,200
Have a safe trip, you sentimental guy.

389
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,370
Getting on a plane without winning either woman's heart...

390
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,390
How sad.

391
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,630
No thanks. You can go. I'm going in.

392
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,930
Take this before you go.

393
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,370
I thought you might be stressed so I brought some medicine.

394
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,030
Here.

395
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,320
Here.

396
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,560
Just give me all of them.

397
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,570
Aigoo...

398
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,280
Seo Ju Won!

399
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,880
What?

400
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,770
 ­Would passengers for flight KE513 to Madrid, Spain please make their way to Gate 5. 

401
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,580
Okay, then...

402
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,360
Go ahead. I'll head out.

403
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,650
Did you think I was being transferred?

404
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,270
Yes.

405
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,490
Does it change things if I'm gone only for five days?

406
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,940
No way.

407
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,320
Okay then. Don't even think about taking it back.

408
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
I won't.

409
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,330
Sign on it.

410
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,420
Signed.

411
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,520
Not like this.

412
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,010
I'll call legal, draw up a contract, and make you sign.

413
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,450
No changing your mind, no canceling.

414
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,660
I got it.

415
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,020
Do you love me?

416
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,620
Of course, I do!

417
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,060
You're going to be late. Go on in.

418
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,510
I can't.

419
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,320
Why am I going on a business trip now?

420
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,200
Every day I waited felt like a thousand years.

421
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,770
Now, I finally got my answer.

422
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,910
Why am I going on a business trip today?

423
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,080
 I just got to the hotel. What are you doing? 

424
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,240
 Working, of course. 

425
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,490
 I want to come back soon. 

426
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,800
 I miss you so much. 

427
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,860
 ­  

428
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,200
   

429
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,380
♫  I try many times, but it doesn't work the way I want  ♫

430
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,860
 Same. 

431
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,650
 I haven't seen a heart emoji in forever! 

432
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,860
 I'll send you more. 

433
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,880
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

434
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,700
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

435
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,230
   

436
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,400
   

437
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,760
I think these are the same...

438
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,640
- Hello. 
 -  I'm done with the meeting. 

439
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,100
 - What are you doing?  
 - I'm on my way to a meeting.

440
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,450
You're with people, right?

441
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,980
I wish I was in a meeting with you. I miss you so much.

442
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,320
A business trip as soon as we get back together? The worst, right?

443
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,450
Yes. I agree.

444
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,300
You're going to retract your notice, right?

445
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,120
No, that's already been decided and can't be retracted.

446
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,530
Why! Let's work together!

447
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,320
 Let me call you back. 

448
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,570
Seriously. You're so mean. 
    

449
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,870
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend?  ♫

450
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,490
Hi, Honey.

451
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,070
Me? I'm eating.

452
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,110
Ji Seok made omelet rolls.

453
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,260
You must miss Korean food.

454
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,240
A love shot? What love shot?

455
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,600
Gosh! Whatever!

456
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,240
I hate seeing her cry,

457
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,770
but I hate watching her like that even more. Geez.

458
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,610
   

459
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:58,480
   

460
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,330
 Students, fighting! 

461
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,100
 Solve the problems! Guess the correct answers! 
   

462
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,050
 Fighting! 

463
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,820
Ha Ji Seok, don't be scared.

464
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,600
But, Nuna, I have to go to college, right?

465
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,230
Are you saying that 30 minutes before the collegiate exam?

466
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,280
If I say that after, you might think I bombed the exams.

467
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,310
But I've been thinking about it.

468
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:33,120
Tuition is expensive. I'm not even passionate about college.

469
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,120
I don't want to waste your hard-earned money.

470
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,510
Then what do you want to do?

471
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,540
I want to take some time off. Maybe a year?

472
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll work part-time, experience things

473
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,940
and figure out what I really want to do.

474
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
You've grown up.

475
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,470
You're right. You don't have to be anxious and

476
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,950
go for it just because everyone else is doing it.

477
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,300
I forced you to study because you're a student.

478
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,830
I just meant to say do your best.

479
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,000
Yes.

480
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,490
Nuna, I'll be successful and treat you right.

481
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,800
So you have to live a long life, okay?

482
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,990
I'll live for a thousand, ten thousand years, so get ready.

483
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,580
Go on in. Call me as soon as you're done.

484
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,070
Okay. Bye.

485
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,630
Aigoo. When did he grow up?

486
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,640
 Want me to go with you when Ji Seok takes the collegiate exam? 

487
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,550
What?

488
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,230
Why would you be there for his exam?

489
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:49,530
I just feel like it's always just you two. I could join.

490
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,230
It's okay. It'll just put too much pressure on him.

491
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,930
I miss him all of a sudden.

492
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:25,470
♫  I sleep without sleeping  ♫

493
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,990
What? How did you get here?

494
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,220
I told you I'd be here on the day of the collegiate exam.

495
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,530
I waited for Ji Seok to go inside so he doesn't feel pressured.

496
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,360
I don't want you to be alone on a day like this.

497
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:48,020
I worked so hard to make a surprise appearance here.

498
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,100
- Really? 
 - Yun Seo, let's skip work.

499
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,660
- What? 
 - I've waited for so long.

500
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,430
♫  Sweet drama  ♫

501
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,280
For the day we could do this again.

502
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,280
I missed you so much in Spain.

503
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,980
I almost lost my mind wanting to see you.

504
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,600
Director, please get it together.

505
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,110
At times like this, we need to work harder and

506
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:18,040
not do things to make others criticize us.

507
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,100
Why are you laughing?

508
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,740
I haven't been scolded like this in so long.

509
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,000
Can you scold me more?

510
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,420
What are you saying?

511
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,750
Let's go.

512
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,870
♫  I promise you, don't let go of my hand  ♫

513
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:40,410
Then since skipping work isn't an option,

514
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,920
I'll leave right after I finish up my business trip stuff.

515
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,400
Are you okay? Don't be so sad.

516
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,470
How could I not be?

517
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,940
I'm the only one who didn't get promoted.

518
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,590
They told me I was up for promotion.

519
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,480
I'm so depressed!

520
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,660
I mean...

521
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,540
when you got promoted alone,

522
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,220
that made sense since you have more experience.

523
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,190
But this time...

524
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,510
Manager No Ye Yeong has been promoted to deputy.

525
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:31,260
Why not me? Why?

526
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,530
That chaebol punk...

527
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,510
He seemed worried, so I took him to get an octopus stir-fry.

528
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,900
How can he betray me?

529
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,050
That's not the Director's decision–

530
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,270
What do you mean?

531
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,350
I'm sure his opinion counted for more than 50%.

532
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,450
Team Leader, good thing you broke up with him.

533
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,600
You shouldn't date someone so two-faced.

534
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,940
Go away!

535
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,890
- Why? 
 - Hurry! Go!

536
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,850
Go?

537
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,090
 Things are bad here. 

538
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,340
   

539
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,880
 Why? Why is it so bad? 

540
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,900
 Deputy Bae is totally upset because he didn't get promoted. 

541
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,560
 Don't come here today. 

542
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,290
 Hold on, and let's get something tasty for dinner. 

543
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,630
 Ji Seok is having dinner with a friend tonight. 

544
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,670
 So I'm free. 

545
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,020
 All right. 

546
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,780
   

547
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,410
Vice Chairman, do you want to have lunch-

548
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,310
Oh, hey.

549
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,150
What are you doing? What's up with your outfit?

550
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:07,770
Your sister-in-law and I are going to play tennis soon.

551
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,250
She wants to take photos for social media.

552
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,000
Right, you got unbanned from social media.

553
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,770
It's nothing.

554
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,780
But you're playing tennis just to get a photo?

555
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,560
That's what I said!

556
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,750
I think it might be her excuse to go on a date with me.

557
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,780
Hey, she just sent this over with Secretary Kim to wear matching outfits.

558
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,600
Gosh, seriously.

559
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,720
Matching couple's outfits? So childish.

560
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,020
Anyway, have lunch with Yun Seo.

561
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,530
I'm going on a date.

562
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,350
See you!

563
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,770
What?

564
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,090
Are they flirting?

565
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,830
We could just meet there, but she came all the way here

566
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,580
so we can go together.

567
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,970
Anyway, I can't stop her.

568
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,300
- Hey. 
 - Hi.

569
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,580
Wow, it looks so good on you.

570
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,150
What about this? This is better.

571
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,930
Let's go.

572
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,210
Here you go.

573
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,070
Why are you giving it to me...

574
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,900
Why else? You're driving, Husband.

575
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,790
 Right. She wants to be alone. 

576
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,860
It's good to get a picture of you driving.

577
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,630
We can promote the new car.

578
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,630
Promotion for the new car?

579
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes.

580
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,960
We'll be back.

581
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,660
Wait...

582
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:17,130
First, we'll promote the new car.

583
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,160
This outfit is a new brand at the department store...

584
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,150
Do we have to do all that?

585
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,510
They might criticize us for making it too blatantly marketing.

586
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,900
We can make it not so obvious.

587
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,700
What a pro marketer.

588
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,590
- What? Am I professional? 
 - What?

589
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,170
Thanks. I hope I make you proud.

590
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,530
 Fighting, Seo Si Won! 

591
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,060
Looking good!

592
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,000
How long do I have to stay like this?

593
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,450
- Turn your head to your left. 
 - This way? Like this?

594
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,460
Too much. Back to the right a bit.

595
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,780
- Like this? 
 - Good, good.

596
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,920
Do it again.

597
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,640
Again?

598
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,300
Bouncing the ball...

599
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,450
Good, good.

600
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,730
Wait!

601
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,900
I think the court on the other side is much better.

602
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,840
Let's go over there.

603
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,970
She's burning up her artistic passion.

604
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:51,860
As if she's the Director Bong Joon Ho.

605
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,370
Hurry over!

606
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,000
You're right! That looks much better over there.

607
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,160
   

608
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,580
 Is the mood still the same? 

609
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,500
   

610
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,170
Hey, Ji Seok.

611
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,450
I was looking up online.

612
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:39,820
I heard it was easier this year. Did you do a good job?

613
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,750
I did. I took a good look at it.

614
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,690
The paper was high-quality.

615
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:47,830
Oh, right. I was supposed to grab dinner with Seok Hyeon

616
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,590
but he canceled because he got a stomach ache from the stress.

617
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:51,420
Wh-What?

618
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,240
 Are you that happy? 

619
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,160
You were sad about me hanging out with a friend on a day like today.

620
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,560
You must be happy that my plan got canceled.

621
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,740
 Buy me some meat. Where should I meet you? 

622
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,730
Oh, well?

623
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,330
It's cooked well.

624
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,570
My goodness.

625
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:14,000
You've gone through so much all this time.

626
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,640
Here. Say ah.

627
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,210
Gosh, I didn't really study that much.

628
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,480
- Me? 
 - Yes.

629
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,270
Hurry.

630
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,860
Good work, my friend.

631
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,770
You're young, yet you took care of your little brother. You went through so much.

632
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,840
Hey, Yun Seo, have a glass. Good job, really.

633
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,920
Ji Seok is all grown up now.

634
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,750
So you do everything you want to do now.

635
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,300
Right, Nuna. Don't worry about me,

636
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,350
and go have fun with the weakling. Okay?

637
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,950
What? Does Ji Seok know that he proposed to you?

638
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:53,750
- Proposal? 
 - Really?

639
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,830
- That's not it... 
 - You're cowering again.

640
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,560
Why do you slouch whenever we bring up Seo Ju Won?

641
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,360
What's wrong?

642
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,370
I mean...

643
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,690
I thought you needed someone to lean on that day. That's why I called him.

644
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,400
I'm fine with you two getting back together.

645
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,150
But honestly, I didn't know he'd bring up getting married already.

646
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,520
When I think about you getting intimidated in that family...

647
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,100
Did you give him your answer?

648
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,970
Come on. Seo Ju Won will do a good job in the middle.

649
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,850
Hey! Bring him over one of these days.

650
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:32,050
I'll make sure he knows not to look down on you.

651
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,340
Yes, yes. I'm pretty much your family.

652
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,960
So I'm like his mother-in-law.

653
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,540
- What? 
 - Then I'll be the father-in-law.

654
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,620
I won't let him get away with anything.

655
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,930
Hey, you're the brother-in-law. I should be the father-in-law.

656
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,660
Let's put a chaebol in his place. Okay, fighting!

657
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,070
 Fighting! 

658
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:52,320
What's with you all? What do you mean put him–

659
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,470
There...

660
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Seriously, I'll be like a father-in-law...

661
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,340
 Are you having fun? Can I join you? 

662
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,940
- Not to get intimidated. 
 - Uncle...

663
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,520
 Sorry. The mood isn't too good tonight. 

664
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:11,400
 The mood there isn't good, either? 

665
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,320
Seok Hyeon says he's fine now. Can I go to the arcade with him?

666
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,530
Really? Seok Hyeon is fine now?

667
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,010
That's so great!

668
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,890
Were you that worried about him?

669
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,400
Yes, of course! He's your friend.

670
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,360
Hurry and go.

671
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,350
Shall we call it a night then?

672
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,980
Yes, Honey. I'm about to catch a cab.

673
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,320
It finished faster than I thought.

674
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,410
 Yes. Where should we meet? 

675
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,300
- We're eating braised monkfish so let's meet there? 
  - Sure. 

676
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,360
 Sure. 

677
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,420
Let's drink soju and beer tonight.

678
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,660
Hold on a moment.

679
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,500
   

680
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,290
Honey, I'm getting a call from Ye Yeong. I'll call you right back.

681
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,260
Yes, Ye Yeong, what's up?

682
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,430
 Team Leader! Save me! 

683
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,770
 Deputy Bae is freaking out saying he'd quit! 

684
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,510
- Pardon? 
 - I'll write my resignation!

685
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,940
He must be upset about not getting the promotion.

686
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,660
He won't even let me go home!

687
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,080
Oh, my. He must be crazy!

688
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,090
He even says he'll post about your relationship with the Director on our company blog.

689
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,430
Saying he'll take revenge on Seo Ju Won and go to hell!

690
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:23,880
- What? 
 - Oh, my!

691
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,060
You must be crazy! Why are you climbing a tree?

692
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,380
Okay, okay. Yes, yes.

693
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,120
The responses are a lot better than I expected.

694
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,600
They're asking tons of questions about what you wore and how I took the picture.

695
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,080
That's good.

696
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,530
But aren't you hungry?

697
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,830
I'm craving hot broth. How about clam noodles and fresh kimchi?

698
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,150
I can't. I'm supposed to have dinner at your hotel.

699
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,730
I heard you opened your restaurant with a Michelin chef from Italy.

700
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,360
The marketing team asked me to go there.

701
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,210
Really?

702
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,860
All right.

703
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,940
- Let's go, then. 
 - Okay.

704
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,350
What was that? Is he tired?

705
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,410
I could've driven.

706
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,880
No, it's okay.

707
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,660
Okay. Thanks.

708
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,890
 ­  

709
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,400
   

710
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,780
Hey, what's wrong?

711
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,400
Let's go eat noodles.

712
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,740
You said you have to take pictures at the hotel.

713
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,900
I changed my mind.

714
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,490
There's a really famous noodle house in the market nearby.

715
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,740
I think I've updated enough today. So, let's relax and eat.

716
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,200
Should we have some makgeolli, too?

717
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,600
Well, that works, too.

718
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,190
So what if I put everything I've got into my work?

719
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,070
- I can't get to the next level! 
 - Come on...

720
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,820
Team Leader...

721
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,130
- Why did you drink so much? 
 - Hi.

722
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,400
- Hey, did you call a driver*? 
 - Yes, I did. 
  (Sounds like "deputy" in Korean) 

723
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,560
Did you call me? Here I am.

724
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,470
- Forever deputy. 
 - I'm sorry. Sorry...

725
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,910
- Sure, sure. 
 - I'm sorry.

726
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,790
What's with you?

727
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:47,160
I'm sure you don't get why I'm like this.

728
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,530
Ye Yeong, you got the promotion!

729
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,540
Team Leader, how does this make sense?

730
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:57,830
All she does is shopping and not work, yet she got promoted.

731
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,540
- Gosh... 
 - What? I didn't shop all the time.

732
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,570
I worked super hard and managed to go shopping here and there.

733
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,600
And I turned in a new proposal since I'm keen on new trends.

734
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,130
- They acknowledged that. 
 - We know.

735
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,090
Shit! I can't hold it in anymore!

736
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,470
I happen to be a talent that the Strategic Team wants.

737
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,400
Is that my fault? Is it?

738
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,610
   

739
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,160
Excuse me, I'll take this call. Sorry.

740
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,150
 ­  

741
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,910
Yes.

742
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,830
Deputy Bae is wasted.

743
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,860
He must be very upset.

744
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,180
I thought he was up for the promotion. Why didn't he get it?

745
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,950
Actually, I postponed it.

746
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,160
 How come? He seems to slack off on the outside, 

747
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,140
- but you know he works hard. 
  - I know. 

748
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,990
That's why I recommended him as a team leader.

749
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:48,050
What?

750
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,370
You keep insisting you'd leave. That means your position is open.

751
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,440
So I was going to give him that position.

752
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,240
 But since people don't know you're quitting, 

753
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,320
I thought it'd be okay if I told him in a few days.

754
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,110
I see.

755
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,860
That's good.

756
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,220
I'll try to wrap up here, so don't worry.

757
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,800
 Okay, got it. 

758
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,660
But I can still see you, right?

759
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,330
Of course. Wait just a little longer.

760
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:16,880
Okay.

761
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,970
Enjoy.

762
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,970
This place is really good. How did you know about this place?

763
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,730
I'm the daughter of a distribution company. Market research is essential.

764
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,510
Right, right. That's right.

765
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,590
But it's my first time just relaxing and having fun.

766
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,680
And...

767
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,650
it's my first time drinking makgeolli out of a kettle like this.

768
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,610
It's so fun. So cute...

769
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,190
Then...

770
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:51,080
take a picture.

771
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,830
It's okay.

772
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:57,650
Do you know that I haven't taken a picture since we got here?

773
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,200
- Really? 
 - Yes.

774
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,490
I want to take them so badly, but I'm holding myself back.

775
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,310
I think you're exhausted from taking pictures all day.

776
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:07,280
I'm not exhausted. I was a little disappointed.

777
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,530
It's our first time being out together so I expected more.

778
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:14,520
But you seemed to think solely of your work.

779
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,870
What's going on? Do you like me?

780
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,370
Wh-What are you saying?

781
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,630
Gosh, I can't believe you said that.

782
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,640
S-So... are we already drunk?

783
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,270
Y-You want another one?

784
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,180
Sure. Should I?

785
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:56,970
  ­ 

786
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,760
Actually, I worked hard at taking pictures today

787
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,400
because I thought you liked it.

788
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,990
What?

789
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,300
You seem to have fun posting on social media.

790
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:12,030
And the stock prices went up, and Mother was happy, too.

791
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:15,870
I thought that was helping you, so that's why I did that.

792
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:19,060
But I went too far.

793
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,040
I must've drank too much tonight.

794
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,770
Let's go home.

795
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,960
Wait for me.

796
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,580
 ­  

797
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,340
Excuse me, passing through.

798
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:22,840
What should I do?

799
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,090
It's weird to say this since we're already married.

800
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,580
But I...

801
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,910
think I like you.

802
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,550
  ­ 

803
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,290
Yes, Mom.

804
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,630
Promotion? Yes.

805
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,120
I got it.

806
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:05,360
That's right. Of course, I get more pay.

807
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,900
But I'm...

808
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,860
with my team members celebrating.

809
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,340
I'll call you again tomorrow.

810
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,800
 Should I just tell him? 

811
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,590
 No. It's about personnel appointments. 

812
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,090
 Ju Won should tell him. 

813
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,890
Here...

814
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,100
Thank you.

815
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,000
 ­What are you doing? 

816
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,010
You! How dare you come here!

817
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,490
Did you come here to mock me while I cry?

818
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:47,670
That's not it. I came because I was worried.

819
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,060
Worried?

820
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,090
I'll give you one last piece of advice.

821
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:57,360
Don't be throwing your weight around!

822
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,420
Stop. Please stop!

823
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:05,790
I'll quit, and you'll get promoted to team leader!

824
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,650
Director, tell him.

825
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:13,720
I should've told you sooner, but since it had to do with the Team Leader...

826
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,890
I meant to promote you to the Team Leader's position when she leaves.

827
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,570
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

828
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:29,080
I'm sorry.

829
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,260
Finally, we're alone.

830
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,710
It was seriously too tough.

831
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,540
I know.

832
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,400
I've never waited for someone like this in my life.

833
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,800
But I feel like I've spent the last few days just waiting.

834
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,840
Waiting for your answer, waiting for the day I could see you...

835
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,650
and waiting to go on a date with you.

836
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,300
What should we do?

837
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm fine with anything. Let's do whatever you want to do.

838
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:12,740
   

839
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,710
No more interruptions, right?

840
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,420
I know, right?

841
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,650
No. I just won't answer it.

842
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:26,230
But still. Something might've come up at the office.

843
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,150
Answer it.

844
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:34,530
Yes.

845
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,690
Oh, really?

846
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:56,700
Sorry. You waited long, right?

847
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,750
I'm all done. Should we go out?

848
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,470
You've been staying here all this time.

849
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,900
Yes.

850
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,640
I'll go back home now.

851
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,540
Don't worry too much.

852
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,520
More than worry,

853
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,060
I feel bad.

854
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,690
To be with me,

855
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,600
you've endured so much

856
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,440
and withstood so many things.

857
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,420
♫  Every scar, every tear  ♫

858
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,300
♫  One less spark clouds in your eyes  ♫

859
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,980
Thank you...

860
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,120
for waiting for me.

861
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,530
I'm more thankful that...

862
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:05,400
you came back to me.

863
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,900
♫  The time won't let us go  ♫

864
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,500
♫  You know, right?  ♫

865
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:21,390
♫  Fading you  ♫

866
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:25,200
♫  Fading you  ♫

867
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,840
♫  Like a fog  ♫

868
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:37,450
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

869
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:40,560
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

870
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,770
I missed you.

871
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:08,970
♫  Every breath, every word, hold on tight, a lonely struggle  ♫

872
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,230
♫  You know, right?  ♫

873
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:20,300
♫  Shining you  ♫

874
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:28,880
♫  Shining you, like starlight  ♫

875
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:36,380
♫  When I look at it, follow it, it's shining on you  ♫

876
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:45,380
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫

877
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:49,280
♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

878
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,370
♫  Every moment we'll go through  ♫

879
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:57,560
♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

880
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,680
   

881
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,500
 I'm here to return the money you gave me. 

882
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,320
 I think you're mistaken about something. 

883
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,140
 Now that I've come back to you, I'm going straight ahead. 

884
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,950
 - Ta-da! 
 - Scared me. 

885
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,370
♫  Happy birthday Dear-  ♫

886
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,620
 Who's saying "Dear" to you- 

887
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,920
 This gathering is for me, right? 

888
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,180
 But I'm extremely uncomfortable. 

889
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,470
 You think you're the only one with first love? I have one, too. 

890
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:28,020
 One I loved passionately. 

891
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,180
 Isn't this jealousy? 

892
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,210
 Can't you just approve of us? 

893
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,040
 I want to be happy now. 

894
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:51,240


895
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:56,400
♫  Every scar, every tear  ♫

896
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,460
♫  One less spark clouds in your eyes  ♫

897
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:10,340
♫  Don't go alone  ♫

898
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:19,060
♫  The time won't let us go  ♫

899
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,520
♫  You know, right?  ♫

900
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:30,390
♫  Fading you  ♫

901
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:33,860
♫  Fading you  ♫

902
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:38,950
♫  Like a fog  ♫

903

906
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:22,340
♫  Always by your side  ♫

907
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:31,000
♫  The time will hold onto us  ♫

908
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,370
♫  You know, right?  ♫

909
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:42,480
♫  Shining you  ♫

910
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:50,980
♫  Shining you, like starlight  ♫

911

912
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:07,550
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫
