1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,420
   

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,420
   

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,370
   

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,760
   

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,110
   

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:35,800


7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,880
   

8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,450
Letting you go...

9
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,790
is the right thing to do, right?

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,450
♫  Every scar, every tear  ♫

11
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:11,700
♫  One less spark clouds in your eyes  ♫

12
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,480
Really?

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,370
♫  Please don't go alone  ♫

14
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:27,030
♫  The time won't let us go  ♫

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,100
♫  You know  ♫

16
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,590
♫  Right? 
 Fading you  ♫

17
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,900
 That night, when the fireworks were the most beautiful, 

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,080
 we broke up. 

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,000
♫  Like a fog  ♫

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,500
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

21
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:03,700
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

22
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,310
   

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,950
Ta-da!

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,190
What is this?

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,430
They were very pretty so I bought them on the way.

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,550
And this is something I made myself.

27
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,860
You should have gotten something with a rock on it.

28
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,770
That's mean. You're so materialistic.

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,300
Did you just figure that out?

30
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,250
I didn't know you knew how to make this kind of thing.

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,150
That's kind of cute.

32
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,520
Still, I prefer something with a rock on it.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,390
Seriously.

34
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,780
If I really got a ring, would she accept it?

35
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,790
Taking pictures of me without warning?

36
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,890
You look so pretty that I couldn't help it.

37
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,760
Look over here. I'll take more.

38
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,010
So pretty.

39
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,860
Stop it.

40
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,400
   

41
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,760
I'll keep developing the resort collaboration event based on our meeting today.

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,460
When is good for the next meeting?

43
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,220
When should we schedule the next meeting...

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,530
What?

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
What did you just say? I didn't hear you.

47
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,160
I would appreciate it if you could pay attention.

48
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,970
When should we schedule the next meeting?

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,870
 We held out, hoping the time would pass somehow. 

50
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,470
Then we will meet about this tomorrow.

51
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,080
 But then... 

52
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,980
   

53
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,740
What is this text?

54
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,290
   

55
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,310
 I kept getting texts from an unsaved number. 

56
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,110
   

57
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,070
   

58
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,130
   

59
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,300
   

60
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,930
No way.

61
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,270
   

62
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,640
These are clearly ex-boyfriend lines.

63
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,460
But they're not from Ju Won.

64
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,940
Did he change his number?

65
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,500
Gosh... 
    

66
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,600
 ­  

67
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,110
Yes, Director.

68
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,450
What's going on?

69
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,910
 I'm postponing today's meeting to next week. 

70
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,380
Okay, got it.

71
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,470
He hasn't changed his number. 
    

72
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,900
Then what is it?

73
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,880
Who keeps texting like this to the wrong number?

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,210
 I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong number. 

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Wait. What if this is a phishing scam?

76
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,980
The second I reply...

77
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,860
No!

78
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,950
What? Since when does he have two phones?

79
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,680
Why is he hiding it?

80
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,820
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

81
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,000
We said we'd break up. This is wrong, no?

82
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,970
- What... 
 - What?

83
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,100
  ­ 

84
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,430
You thought I wouldn't notice if it came from a different number?

85
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,240
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

86
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,600
It wasn't easy for me to break up with you.

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,290
- But if you keep sending me texts like this— 
 - It wasn't me.

88
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,290
What? I caught you red-handed.

89
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,130
You have two phones!

90
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,350
This is AL Electronic's new model. I was testing it.

91
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,540
What?

92
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,800
You know security is important in this industry.

93
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,700
I only look at it when I'm alone. When we made eye contact, I flinched.

94
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,560
I see.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
Yes.

96
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,860
Bye, then.

97
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,560
Yes, Ye Yeong. Dinner? Sure.

98
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,810
Where should I meet you?

99
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,960
That's my phone.

100
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,290
I'll call it a day.

101
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,950
Bye.

102
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,100
Is she leaving work on time?

103
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,550
That means we should go, too.

104
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,130
Nice!

105
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,340
This is crazy!

106
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,290
Why did I think that?

107
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,560
   

108
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,130
Because of you...

109
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,810
Who is this?

110
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,070
Maybe it's an ex-ex-boyfriend.

111
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,890
Yun Seo, I know from receiving many messages like these.

112
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,360
I can feel the longing in them.

113
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,480
They're definitely for a former lover.

114
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,240
But if it's not your ex-boyfriend, Ju Won,

115
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,740
it must be your ex-ex-boyfriend.

116
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,330
Or your ex-ex-ex-boyfriend,

117
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,660
or your ex-ex-ex-ex-boyfriend.

118
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,290
Uncle, you mind your own business.

119
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm doing fine.

120
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,960
Is there someone you had a meal with or something?

121
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,410
A meal? That wouldn't call for sentimental texts like these.

122
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,850
That's true.

123
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,550
"Sorry to text you."

124
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,170
I think it's a phishing scam.

125
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,810
I know it's not Ju Won, so I'll just mark it as spam.

126
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,400
What are you doing?

127
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,710
It's weird.

128
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,350
What kind of voice phishing scam is so poetic?

129
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,820
- I need to check. 
 - Check what?

130
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,590
Hello?

131
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,040
You've been texting this number for the past few days. Right?

132
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,670
Who are you?

133
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,640
Put it on speaker! Speaker!

134
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,440
Isn't this Kang Jae Hui's phone?

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,940
No.

136
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,300
It's Ha Yun Seo's.

137
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,370
I thought it was someone I knew.

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,180
I added the number but didn't see a profile picture.

139
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,420
I made a mistake.

140
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:05,210
Right, I've been mistakenly reading your texts. Sorry.

142
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,230
Okay, then.

143
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,940
So it wasn't spam. Just sad.

144
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,700
Not voice phishing, just a sad voice.

145
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,440
Right. He must be going through a breakup, too.

146
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
 Sir. 

147
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,390
Coming.

148
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,700
I got it. You don't need to help.

149
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,300
It'll be faster with two people.

150
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,600
By the way...

151
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,900
you're not sad that those texts weren't from Ju Won, right?

152
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,700
- What? 
 - You know.

153
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,000
You want them to get over you, but it's upsetting if they actually do so soon.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
You know how it is.

155
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,500
It's not like that.

156
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,300
But I did have a thought.

157
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,800
This is why they say not to date someone at work.

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Having to see his face at work is really hard.

159
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
Then don't see his face.

160
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,100
- How? 
 - Just avoid him as much as possible.

161
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,000
That's not easy when we work in the same office.

162
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,000
Yun Seo, Ji Seok is here.

163
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,900
Oh, okay. The time went by so fast.

164
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
Wow, Ji Seok! You're all grown up!

165
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,800
Did you come to take your sister home late at night?

166
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,300
What a good boy.

167
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Let Uncle give you a little allowance…

168
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
I only have 1,000 won today.

169
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Next time.

170
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Hi, Ji Seok!

171
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,800
Wow, how come you get more handsome every time I see you?

172
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,600
How are your grades? Still bad?

173
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Well, they're okay.

174
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,600
- Let's go. 
- Wh-Why?

175
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,300
Eat something since you're here, Ji Seok.

176
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,500
Want some noodles?

177
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,900
No. It's okay.

178
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,500
Bye. We'll get going.

179
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

180
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,100
Good night.

181
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
They're the closest siblings in Jongno-gu.

182
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
What's up with them today?

183
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
I know.

184
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,200
From now on, meet me at Yi Rae's like this and we'll go home together.

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,300
I'd prefer to wait for you at school, but I'm holding back.

186
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,500
Got a problem with it?

187
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
No.

188
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
What do they say at school?

189
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
No decision yet for the other guys.

190
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,700
Seok Hyeon and I got community service for a week.

191
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,000
A week of service doesn't undo your wrong.

192
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
I know that.

193
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,300
And don't assume Yeong Su will understand.

194
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,500
Don't give him a forced apology, either.

195
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,400
If he hates you, there's nothing you can do. Be prepared for that.

196
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,490
Okay.

197
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,700
I'll prepare for that. I'll also apologize properly.

198
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,770
I'm sorry I'm being so harsh.

199
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,860
You know it's because I care about you, right?

200
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,600
Of course, I know.

201
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,700
But Nuna...

202
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,900
This is kind of cheesy.

203
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
I agree.

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,300
If I don't do this, you'll run away.

205
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,900
I need to go somewhere with you. Come with me.

206
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,800
Let go. Let me go.

207
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,400
Nuna!

208
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,100
Nuna, I know I can't say this right now, but...

209
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Would this make a difference a month out from the collegiate exam?

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,900
I don't have a dream school or one I want to get into.

211
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:01,500
This whole time, I let you be because I didn't want to force you to do anything.

212
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,100
But I want to teach you how to see something through.

213
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,200
Like an ordinary person. Like others.

214
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
So take the collegiate exam.

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Do your best with what you have.

216
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
Got it?

217
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Okay.

218
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,300
Solve all those problems, okay?

219
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,400
- All of these? 
 - Of course. That's why we're buying it.

220
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,100
Wait, the weakling-

221
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,800
I-I mean, he looks a lot like your boyfriend.

222
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,300
His eyes and nose are totally weak like him.

223
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Lookalike? No way.

224
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
Let's go. We should pay.

225
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Right, how can I compare a chaebol heir to the weakling?

226
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,700
He would sue me if he heard me.

227
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
Right.

228
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,500
 He's focused on looking ahead. 

229
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,100
 How could I accuse him of texting me? 

230
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,700
 Starting tomorrow, I'll avoid him as much as possible. 

231
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,200
I have something to say.

232
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Something to say? Did we have things left to say?

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,500
We could still talk even if we're broken up.

234
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Nuna, you broke up with the weakling?

235
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,100
Excuse me, what did you do to my sister?

236
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,900
Why did you dump her? Why did you abandon her?

237
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,590
I was dumped. I was abandoned.

238
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,300
O-Oh, my.

239
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,480
Why did you do that? You were crazy about him.

240
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,880
Go inside before I kill you.

241
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,650
I should stay with you.

242
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,600
What if the weakling, I mean,

243
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,800
he came here all mad? I should beat the shit out of him.

244
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,900
Get lost before I beat the shit out of you.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Go!

246
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,400
Why are you here?

247
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,480
I want my gifts back.

248
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,500
The necklace, perfume, stuffed animal, and book.

249
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,300
I didn't send you those weird texts, but you misunderstood. Apologize.

250
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,490
So what were those texts?

251
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,780
I know I shouldn't be curious about these things now,

252
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,460
but I'm just really curious. It's bothering me.

253
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,300
Those desperate phrases won't leave my head.

254
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,090
   

255
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,990
   

256
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,430
   

257
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,870
   

258
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,850
Is it your ex-boyfriend?

259
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,660
Aren't you my ex-boyfriend?

260
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,260
Then is it your ex-ex-boyfriend?

261
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,310
What are you talking about?

262
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,050
He had the wrong number.

263
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,850
I think he's going through a breakup, too.

264
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,350
I don't care if you think I'm being pathetic here.

265
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,640
You can't just cut off someone's feelings in one strike.

266
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Think of it as the warranty period and let it go.

267
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,100
Does it make you uncomfortable to see me at work?

268
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I try not to step out of my office for your sake.

269
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,600
But if it's too much, please let me know.

270
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,800
If I do?

271
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll move my office or something.

272
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,200
Honestly...

273
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,800
I'm a little confused, too.

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,400
Trying to get over you while seeing your face every day...

275
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,000
is not easy.

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,900
It's sinking in.

277
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,200
But there's work we need to do together.

278
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,500
We should try.

279
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:05,400
♫  Every tear, one less spark clouds in your eyes  ♫

280
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,100
 AL Card may be a latecomer on the scene 

281
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,000
but grew to be second place in the industry with aggressive marketing.

282
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,200
But the gap between us and the first place is not closing in.

283
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,100
The biggest reason for this...

284
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:32,500
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

285
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,500
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

286
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,300
...a multi-purpose space project.

287
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,830
We have less than a week until the launch. Let's wrap it up well.

288
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,790
Got it! Do not worry.

289
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,240
By the way, do we travel in the same car for the launch?

290
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,770
If so, how about my car?

291
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,660
 Right. The business trip. 

292
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,650
I have a brand new car.

293
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,090
Let me drive you, Director.

294
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,780
Overnight in a hanok*?
    

295
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,010
I bought a camera to get some once-in-a-lifetime shots!

296
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,470
 Right, we're staying overnight. 

297
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,510
I have to stop by some other places. I'll go separately.

298
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,560
Okay, then.

299
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,250
What was that?

300
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,700
He doesn't want to mix with us now that he's the Director?

301
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,980
I was hoping to impress him by driving him in my new car.

302
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,770
Geez.

303
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,250
 He's avoiding me for me. 

304
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,340
 Is avoiding her really the answer? 

305
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,620
 If she had dinner in Cheongdam-dong, she's still in Korea. 

306
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,190
 That means she'll come home tonight. 

307
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,530
 How long is she planning on staying? 

308
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:08,150
Why are you still here?

309
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,950
Oh, there are road closures ahead.

310
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,100
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,340
Oh, right. Road closures during rush hour? What a problem.

312
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,340
I'm sorry.

313
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,710
Good evening.

314
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,680
Hi.

315
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,760
   

316
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,770
   

317
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,560
What? Isn't that your husband calling?

318
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,330
Why aren't you answering?

319
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,250
It's awkward.

320
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,150
It's awkward to talk to him on the phone?

321
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,030
Wow. How can you live under one roof?

322
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,220
We don't.

323
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,930
True. You left for Paris right after the wedding and have been living separately.

324
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,210
Yes.

325
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,500
The longest we've been together is 13 hours, maybe?

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,740
13 hours?

327
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,130
Yes. The day we first met.

328
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,770
From Incheon to Paris.

329
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,490
Right. We had our blind date on the plane.

330
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,350
 What? 

331
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,410
 I've never gone on a blind date on a plane before. 

332
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,610
 Me neither. 

333
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,190
 But I don't mind this. 

334
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,600
 You and I both need arranged marriages. 

335
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,410
 I don't expect romance, 

336
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,240
 but if we hate each other, it'd be hard to live under one roof. 

337
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,010
 Right. 

338
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,860
 Rather than going on dates that last one or two hours, if we're in one place for long like this, 

339
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,790
 we'd figure out dietary preferences, wine preferences, 

340
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,570
 what kind of movies you choose, 

341
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,040
 how you choose to spend a long plane ride. 

342
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,960
 Even sleep habits. 

343
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,280
 Not bad, right? 

344
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,820
 Of course, you're welcome to check me out as well. 

345
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,410
 What kind of wine would you like? 

346
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,300
 - Red. 
 - White. 

347
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,580
 How's the temperature? 

348
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,510
 - Too hot. 
 - Too cold. 

349
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,280
   

350
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,230
 The call is not going through... 

351
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,900
Why isn't she answering?

352
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,500
She won't pick up my calls, and I still don't know why she's here.

353
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,440
When is she leaving?

354
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,560
This is so uncomfortable.

355
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,060
  ­ 

356
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,160
  ­ 

357
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,810
 How can I get through this time? 

358
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,620
 Excuse me, I told you I'm not who you're looking for. 

359
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,930
 Why did you text me again? 

360
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,210
 Since you're not the one I'm looking for, it made me feel more free. 

361
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,820
What a load of crap!

362
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,630
   

363
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,830
Hello. What are you doing?

364
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,830
Why are you calling me?

365
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,050
What did you just mean?

366
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,420
I meant what I said.

367
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:30,440
Honestly, I secretly hoped my texts wouldn't be delivered.

368
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,210
I'm not sure how I feel, either.

369
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,270
Part of me wanted them to go through

370
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,670
and part of me didn't.

371
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,670
So I was wondering...

372
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,700
now that we're here, can I text you sometime?

373
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,850
You can just keep ignoring them like you have so far.

374
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,510
What a nutjob.

375
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,140
- Nutjob? 
 -  Oh, my. 

376
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,340
Did you hear that?

377
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,850
- I did. 
 -  Good. 

378
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,520
 Texting the wrong number? Fine. 

379
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,410
But continuing to text me when you know?

380
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,950
 Do you think that makes sense? 

381
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,890
Does it not?

382
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,090
Excuse me, I wasn't going to say this, but...

383
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,530
I thought my ex had sent those texts and went to confront him.

384
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,160
I was humiliated!

385
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,860
 Every time I get a text from you, 

386
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,430
my heart drops like it's a disaster alert!

387
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,000
You must still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend.

388
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,900
More like

389
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,340
we're still in the process of breaking up.

390
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,850
I'm trying to immerse myself in work

391
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,950
 to overcome this difficult time. 

392
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,150
Damn it. Why do I keep responding?

393
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,720
 Whatever. Don't ever contact me again. 

394
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,720
Let's not get distracted. Let's get to work.

395
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,790
I have an important project coming up.

396
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,250
Right. Work. Focus.

397
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,360
Team Leader, hello!

398
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,230
This is my car. Isn't she gorgeous?

399
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,740
Yes. Shiny like a brand-new car.

400
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,060
She's so, so, so precious to me.

401
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm sorry I'm late!

402
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,020
- Hey.
 - Be on time!

403
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,200
What if we get there after the Director?

404
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,830
Sorry. But it wasn't because I was taking my time.

405
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,500
It was because I bought snacks for all of us.

406
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,290
Ta-da! I got all the new items.

407
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,050
Is that so? Good work.

408
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,490
Why did you get so much?

409
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,500
- I did well, right?
 - Yes, you did.

410
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,100
- Get in. Shall we go? 
 - Okay.

411
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,920
- Go! 
- Let's go!

412
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,220
Ye Yeong, seriously.

413
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,160
You sure are "No" Ye Yeong.

414
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,090
Your behavior is screaming, "No Manners Yeong."

415
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,150
How can you eat snacks with crumbs in the car?

416
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,400
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,530
Stop it! Don't move.

418
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,910
Ye Yeong, here.

419
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,730
Eat with this around your ears.

420
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,210
Thank goodness the director didn't see this.

421
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,620
God helped us by sending him separately.

422
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,250
Is the director coming with a chauffeur?

423
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,080
- I don't know. 
 - If it were me, I'd bring

424
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,210
a chauffeur, a secretary, anyone I can bring.

425
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,190
I'd take a limousine this big and have some champagne

426
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,570
and play some drinking games.

427
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,280
That's what I'd do.

428
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,150
But the director really doesn't show off his chaebol side.

429
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,450
When I first heard that Ju Won was the chairwoman's son,

430
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,340
I was so shocked.

431
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,740
I still feel as if someone ran into me head-on.

432
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,200
Are you okay?

433
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,870
- Are you okay? 
 - Yes!

434
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,190
Are you okay?

435
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,420
Okay, then. I'll call you.

436
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,750
What happened?

437
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,960
The car in the back admitted his mistake

438
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,450
and insurance will cover it.

439
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,710
It was a brand-new car with the plastic still on...

440
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,730
I'm sorry, Jang Dol!

441
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,410
Jang Dol?

442
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,910
Did the car have a name?

443
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,380
Anyway, we're not late, right?

444
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,890
I looked it up. There's a rental car company 10 minutes away.

445
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,150
If we leave now, we won't be late.

446
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,900
Should we grab a cab?

447
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,380
- Yes. 
 - He's here.

448
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,570
How did the director...

449
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,850
I texted him.

450
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,000
If we arrive after the director,

451
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,230
I thought he might be confused by himself.

452
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,210
But I didn't know he would come to pick us up himself...

453
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,060
Are you hurt anywhere?

454
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,900
- No. 
 - We should get you checked out first.

455
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,990
I can go on this trip alone, so...

456
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,030
No need to cancel the business trip.

457
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,620
You two should go to the hospital. I'm fine.

458
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm fine, too.

459
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,850
Deputy Bae, you go.

460
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,580
I don't know if you're that hurt, but...

461
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,450
I-I'm fine, too!

462
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,110
Today is a big day! I can keep going!

463
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,430
Let's not delay further. Shall we?

464
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,110
Let's go.

465
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,430
Are you really going to drive yourself?

466
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,830
It's a long drive. You'll be tired. Let me do it.

467
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm okay. You know I'm a good driver.

468
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,990
People say they fall asleep easily when I drive.

469
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,770
I used to drive your car a lot when we went off-site.

470
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,850
Right, my eyes were closed during those rides.

471
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:07,130
S-Should we listen to some music?

472
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,970
Let me pick the songs!

473
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,060
Director, can I connect to the Bluetooth?

474
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,850
Of course.

475
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,590
Yun Seo's phone?

476
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,470
Team Leader, have you been in this car before?

477
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,990
I...

478
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,990
I have a friend named Kim Yun Seo. Kim Yun Seo.

479
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,790
   

480
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,120
   

481
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,810
Hello, this is Team Leader Ha Yun Seo.

482
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,990
 Hello, Team Leader. When are you arriving today? 

483
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,980
We'll get there on time.

484
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,780
I'll call you before we arrive.

485
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,710
Right! One time, you drove me to the subway station

486
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,000
while we were talking about work.

487
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,890
I think it must have connected then.

488
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,490
Right, that's right. I forgot about that.

489
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,920
It wasn't my friend Kim Yun Seo but Team Leader Ha Yun Seo.

490
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,780
Right.

491
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,510
Don't you think there's something between those two?

492
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,860
Like what?

493
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,760
The vibes at meetings these days have been a little strange.

494
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,730
I think they're flirting.

495
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,220
- Flirting? 
 - Be quiet!

496
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,600
I can't! You're making no sense.

497
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,260
I've worked under the scary Ha Yun Seo for two years.

498
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,230
Flirting? Flirting!

499
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,250
It's a relief he hasn't run away scared.

500
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,180
I know, but how do you explain the Bluetooth?

501
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,160
What do you mean? He's putting her in her place.

502
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,030
- Putting her in her place? 
 - Yes!

503
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:23,570
Remember when he was stroking her hair?

504
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,310
They can talk about work at the office. Why give her a lift?

505
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,210
It's saying, "Get in my luxury car, and"

506
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,740
"look at where I am and bow down." No?

507
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,880
Would you like a snack?

508
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,540
Would I? Of course.

509
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,120
What are you buying?

510
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,160
Let's take a look.

511
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,530
- Sure. 
 - Over there.

512
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,200
Wow. You bought all this?

513
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,740
A big spender at the rest stop.

514
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,420
People might think you're a chaebol.

515
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,470
I mean, you are a chaebol.

516
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,030
Anyway, thank you!

517
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,470
Thank you for the food!

518
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,410
Treating us to snacks, driving us...

519
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:12,620
You're doing so much all because of Deputy Bae, Director.

520
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,880
Because of me?

521
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,810
If you were driving right, there wouldn't have been an accident.

522
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,820
The car in the back crashed into us. What was I supposed to do?

523
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,960
You should have seen the back car coming.

524
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,520
Right, right.

525
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,740
I should have seen the back car coming.

526
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,920
Why didn't I?

527
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,580
I was distracted because you were spreading crumbs all over my car!

528
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,860
I haven't said anything because I have such a generous heart!

529
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,350
What's wrong with you guys? Stop it.

530
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,720
Here. Let's eat.

531
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,070
Deputy Bae, Manager No.

532
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,310
Honey, have some.

533
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,790
Honey?

534
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,420
Team Leader, are you the director's honey?

535
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,910
What? No way. Why would you say that?

536
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,580
How could I be the director's honey? Stop it, Deputy Bae.

537
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,890
But you just said, "Honey."

538
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,800
No, I said, "Here."

539
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,440
That's right. I heard "Here."

540
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,370
I heard that, too, right?

541
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,640
"Here." That's what he said.

542
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,580
 What do I do? 

543
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,710
 After the Bluetooth incident, this was really dangerous. 

544
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,090
 ­  

545
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,810
He definitely said, "Honey."

546
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,900
- You can't fool my ears. 
 - Mine, neither.

547
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,280
See what I mean?

548
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,060
Those two are definitely flirting.

549
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,580
Right.

550
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,720
It seems impossible, but they might be.

551
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,440
Let's keep watching.

552
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,410
Do you think they figured out that we're dating?

553
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,120
I mean, that we used to date?

554
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm sorry. I should have been more careful.

555
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,510
Anyway, let's just be more careful moving forward.

556
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,510
Okay. Wait.

557
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,050
Here.

558
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,010
What is this?

559
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,300
You got into an accident.

560
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,870
They were selling it over there, so I got one.

561
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,010
It has multiple kinds of herbs inside.

562
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,930
It's a natural painkiller made of organic ingredients.

563
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,600
It's called "One Shot" because it cures you in one shot.

564
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,510
That's what the doctor said.

565
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,950
When did you get this?

566
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,600
Thanks.

567
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,930
But don't do stuff like this from now on.

568
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,170
Even if I get into an accident, don't come get me.

569
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,520
Don't worry about me anymore.

570
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,600
- Why not? 
 - What do you mean?

571
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,220
We're broken up.

572
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,410
We're strangers now.

573
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,010
We should become more distant from each other.

574
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,840
- Yun Seo. 
 - I'm off.

575
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,970
♫  You're a small boat floating in the sea  ♫

576
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,100
Hello, Director.

577
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,590
This way, please.

578
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:51,610
♫  Following the warm breeze until I reach you  ♫

579
00:40:52,420 --> 00:41:00,040
♫  I forget all about the places I've been to  ♫

580
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:10,240
♫  The compass in my hand spins around and around  ♫

581
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,620
♫  You're my only one, shining star  ♫

582
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,170
♫  You shine so far away  ♫

583
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,060
♫  If I reach out my hands, I can almost touch it  ♫

584
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:29,590
♫  But I still have a way to go  ♫

585
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,790
 Ju Won will have more to do now. 

586
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,660
 I hope the time we had together doesn't make him suffer. 

587
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,000
So awkward...

588
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,560
It's so uncomfortable to be dressed like this at home.

589
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,920
If you're coming over to someone's house, you should call ahead!

590
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,700
I guess it's our house.

591
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,310
I forgot since we've barely ever lived together.

592
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,660
I could use a drink.

593
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,990
Wait. It's our house. I'm allowed to have one.

594
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,100
That one's a limited edition, one of two in Korea...

595
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,030
That one was a gift from the French embassy...

596
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,850
That one, I got in Milan because the case was pretty...

597
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,030
Right. I have such good eyes.

598
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,930
I should post it on social media.

599
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,310
I heard you're launching a hanok stay in Yeosu.

600
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,130
Are you not going?

601
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,750
I have an important meeting in the morning.

602
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,070
If you have an important meeting, why are you out here?

603
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,000
I-I was going to have a drink before bed.

604
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,390
Wouldn't it be better to go to bed without one?

605
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,430
If it's an important meeting?

606
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:19,520
Thanks...

607
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,310
for the advice.

608
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,420
Right.

609
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,260
She'll probably leave in a few days. I'll let it go.

610
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,030
You know why?

611
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,250
Because I'm a generous person.

612
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,910
Excuse me, that's Sebas—

613
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,740
That's my dishwasher. Why...

614
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,190
Executive Director wanted to replace it with a German model.

615
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,800
- What? 
 - It's a new brand

616
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,400
that her department store is about to launch, so she wants to test it.

617
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,300
- This goes to storage, too, right? 
 - Yes.

618
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,750
Sebastian...

619
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,730
Alberto...

620
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,720
What? I thought you went to bed.

621
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,650
Yes. I was going to, but we need to talk.

622
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,550
I'm coming in for a second.

623
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,510
I know we don't share our daily lives with each other.

624
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,360
So I let it go when you appeared out of nowhere from Paris.

625
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,920
- But what is this? 
 - What?

626
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,870
I thought you were here for a few days. Why are you changing the appliances?

627
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,550
I'm not here just for a few days.

628
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,080
Then?

629
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:58,130
I'll consider this a gift for my transfer to Korea headquarters.

630
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,870
Santé.

631
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,500
T-Transfer to Korea headquarters?

632
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,480
T-Then, are we...

633
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,560
living together... from now on?

634
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,720
Yes. It's not "I Live Alone" anymore for you.

635
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,960
Should we take a picture together to commemorate?

636
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,620
To fight the gossip saying that our marriage is for show.

637
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,160
I guess it's not gossip but real.

638
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,840
Since our marriage is for show, right?

639
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,270
 We'll now commence the launch ceremony for "Stay Yeoran." 

640
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,070
Such a young guy is getting a big position without working for it,

641
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,850
thanks to his nice parents.

642
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:59,050
I know. I heard he gained experience as a regular employee,

643
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,400
but who knows if he actually did it?

644
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,980
Did anyone even see it?

645
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,560
I did.

646
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,370
I saw.

647
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,940
I was his superior.

648
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:14,250
He worked die-hard so he wouldn't have to hear that.

649
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,050
No matter how bad he was at his job, I'm sure he put in more effort than they did.

650
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,970
He worked so hard, under a crazy workhorse like me.

651
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,490
 I don't know what criteria you used to organize this. 

652
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,890
 You should have asked me. Why didn't you? 

653
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,900
 Seo Ju Won, don't make things worse moving forward. 

654
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,750
 Report to me in advance. 

655
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,110
 Got it. 

656
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:56,620
♫  Imagined times of your day  ♫

657
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:07,220
♫  The things that make you feel down  ♫

658
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:13,880
Deputy, I saw some things missing in the data analysis report.

659
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,870
I made some edits. Could you take a look?

660
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,050
Okay.

661
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:20,160
Oh, and I took a shot at the trend research report.

662
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,820
Could you review it when you have time?

663
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,850
- Sure. 
 - Thank you.

664
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:30,240
 I know it wasn't easy for him to get to where he is. 

665
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,270
 I always wanted you to do well. 

666
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,020
 Seeing you like that made me genuinely happy, 

667
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,740
 and made me realize... 

668
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,770
 that this is my last day as Team Leader Ha Yun Seo. 

669
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,440
 Then don't see his face. 

670
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,120
 - How? 
 - Just avoid him as much as possible. 

671
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,120
 That's not easy working in the same office. 

672
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,120
Until I quit, I'll have to deal with it.

673
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,330
Quit?

674
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,680
We broke up. It's weird to stay in the same space.

675
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,340
What?

676
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,510
Then tell him to quit!

677
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,830
Don't give up your livelihood because you broke up!

678
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,610
I'm not giving up.

679
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:27,490
For me, and for Ju Won,

680
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,060
I should leave.

681
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,730
 I already knew 

682
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,020
 that if one of us had to leave, 

683
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,620
 it would be me. 

684
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,800
 I hope that you go so far that I can't reach you 

685
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,490
 and become so happy. 

686
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,800
We're opening up our hanok stay to the public next week.

687
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,100
We sold out all rooms as soon as we opened it up today.

688
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,430
Daebak!

689
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:07,500
Our hanok is so hot right now!

690
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,830
The alcohol is tasty, work is going well,

691
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,400
the sunset is amazing.

692
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,970
Cheers!

693
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:17,940
 Cheers! 

694
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,360
Team Leader, why aren't you drinking?

695
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,940
I know, you're not even driving like I am. Have a glass.

696
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,380
I'll get you home safely.

697
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,480
No. I'm going to stay another night.

698
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,550
There's stuff I didn't get to check out because of the launch.

699
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,320
I want to look around properly for one more day.

700
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,680
She's such a workaholic.

701
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,840
We just finished something. Take a break!

702
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,450
Working again?

703
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,640
Team Leader Ha Yun Seo, you just finished a project.

704
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,250
You'll work us to death starting next week, asking us to bring new ideas.

705
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:04,720
But if she asks you, are you able to?

706
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,350
- You can't even. 
 - Don't underestimate me.

707
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,760
I have at least two or three projects to start.

708
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,300
I thought everyone went back together.

709
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,190
How about you, Director?

710
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,030
I wanted to look around a little more.

711
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,250
Me, too.

712
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,600
Could we...

713
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,050
take a walk?

714
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,040
You were awesome today.

715
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,410
Me?

716
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,880
You were the awesome one, Director.

717
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,080
What's awesome about me?

718
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,830
Ha Yun Seo is awesome for planning and executing this project.

719
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,310
Showing this place off today, getting compliments,

720
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,250
I was so proud of Team Leader Ha Yun Seo.

721
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:43,980
I was glad for my good taste in loving such a cool person.

722
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,050
But I was also heartbroken.

723
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,430
I really tried my best.

724
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,810
I know.

725
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,880
So...

726
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:04,940
I think I can leave without regrets now.

727
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:13,040
I'm going to quit.

728
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,160
Ha Yun Seo.

729
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,250
That's my plan.

730
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,010
I think I need to do that.

731
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,510
Yun Seo.

732
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,400
I mean, Team Leader Ha Yun Seo.

733
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,500
I might have lost you as my lover, but I don't want to lose you as my colleague.

734
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:38,700
I looked up to Team Leader Ha Yun Seo. That's how I got here.

735
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,170
So?

736
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,670
You want us to keep this up?

737
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:49,060
You don't leave your office not to make me feel uncomfortable.

738
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,610
We have to drive separately when we go on business trips.

739
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,840
You get nervous in case we slip in front of others.

740
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:01,500
Seo Ju Won, you're smart.

741
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,210
You know we can't keep doing this.

742
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:05,930
Yun Seo...

743
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,110
Thanks for everything.

744
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:19,000
I was happy that I got to dream here.

745
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,420
 I'll leave once this important project is wrapped up. 

746
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:43,710
Mother, I have something to...

747
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,370
Long time no see, Ju Won!

748
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,700
Hello. How have you been?

749
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,680
I heard that the launch went well.

750
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,250
Good work.

751
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,000
Sit.

752
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,710
Please transfer me abroad.

753
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,500
You said you wouldn't go.

754
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,840
- But— 
 - Next year,

755
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,470
you will take Si Won's position.

756
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:21,350
- What do you— 
 - I'm coming back to Korea for good.

757
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,740
I'll take over the department store in full swing.

758
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,580
Si Won is going to Production.

759
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:29,370
This was always planned when we got married.

760
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,170
The timing got moved up, but...

761
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,500
your sister-in-law and I will expand distributions, and

762
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,710
then you'll need to handle the credit card department.

763
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:39,230
Then...

764
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,170
I think we're done here.

765
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,130
How can you decide this without talking to me?

766
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,750
Do I need to discuss every company matter with you?

767
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,200
This isn't about the company. It's about me.

768
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,940
I want to go abroad. Please let me go.

769
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,790
Do you know how immature and irresponsible you sound?

770
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,110
Please.

771
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,270
It's too late.

772
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,140
Just this one time.

773
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,610
Could you be my mother instead of the chairwoman?

774
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:46,360
I don't know how much longer I can stand this.

775
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,030
Who is it?

776
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,830
Wh-What?

777
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,480
Yun Seo.

778
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,170
I have nowhere to go.

779
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,860
I have nowhere to go.

780
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,760
Can you please let me in?

781
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,290
What do you mean?

782
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,560
I left everything behind.

783
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,590
Left behind?

784
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,750
All I have now...

785
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,280
is you.

786
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:13,260
♫  Fading you  ♫

787
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:21,700
♫  Fading you, like a fog  ♫

788
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:29,220
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

789
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:32,860
♫  So I just let the color wash over me  ♫

790
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:37,980
♫  Like this  ♫

791
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,850
Weakling?

792
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,640
I thought you broke up! Why are you here again?

793
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,990
Hey, little brother. Do you have the answer sheet to this?

794
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:53,470
In my day, we didn't learn stuff like this...

795
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,100
Director?

796
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,990
Is the chicken fry stew here?

797
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:59,250
Director...

798
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,920
D-Director?

799
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,260
Is the weakling the third-generation chaebol heir?

800
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:09,330
Delivery! I heard the company folks were here...

801
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:12,500
What? Are you two back together?

802
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,860
Back together?

803
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,210
You two were dating?

804
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:33,480


805
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,640
♫  The more I get to know ya, can't tell the feelings I feel  ♫

806
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,770
♫  Sometimes it doesn't feel so right  ♫

807
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:46,430
   

808
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:52,650
 Our workplace romance was revealed after we broke up. 

809
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:56,230
 Deputy Bae and I decided to split up and watch you two. 

810
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,400
 So many couples date and break up at work. 

811
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,490
 Are you going to butt in every time that happens? 

812
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,070
 What are you doing? 

813
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:05,320
 Open up! 

814
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,930
 She must have run into the chairwoman and gotten slapped! 

815
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,970
 Will Team Leader Ha Yun Seo be there later? 

816
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,780
 I think she's kind of fun. 

817
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,010
 Did you ever actually love me? 

818
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,340
 I'm pathetic for still having feelings for you after breaking up, 

819
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:22,780
 but all I've been thinking about is how not to hurt you. 

820
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:29,380
♫  Will you stay here until the sunrise?  ♫

821
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,580
♫  I'll stay by your side every night  ♫

822
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:39,870
♫  We grow closer without even noticing  ♫

823
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,070
♫  What should I do?  ♫

824
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:47,420
♫  It must be one of us, one of us, making two of us, two of us, feel good  ♫

825
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,420
♫  Same unusual feeling  ♫

826
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,720
♫  It's too complicated to say, I want to know what you think  ♫

827
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,270
♫  What about you? Do you feel just like I do?  ♫

828
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:04,690
