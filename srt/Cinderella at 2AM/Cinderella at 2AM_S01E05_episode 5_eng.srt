1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,580
   

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,660
   

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,530
   

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,000
   

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,470
   

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:35,280


7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,100
   

8
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,190
   
 This started at the Yeosu business trip. 

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,290
So nice.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,620
   

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,900
 Nuna, I'm studying hard so you better be working hard, too. 

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,210
 That's how you're going to feed me, right? 

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,420
You said your brother was a senior in high school.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,510
Did he send you a photo to prove he's studying?

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,140
Yes. The college entrance exam is coming soon,

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,980
but his grades aren't that great.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,500
Right. This is wrong, and this is wrong, too.

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Come on. What are you saying?

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,000
- What do you know about math? 
 - Why wouldn't I know?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,360
I was crazy good at math in school.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm the kind of guy who solves math problems to de-stress!

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,700
You know competitions? I won awards!

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,800
I made tons of money tutoring math in college, too!

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,060
Then stop bragging and tutor the Team Leader's brother.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,860
We got incentives because of the hanok stay.

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,160
We owe her a lot.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,280
What? We don't owe her that much.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,800
Tell him to come to the office sometime. I'll take a look.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,400
It's okay. Thanks for offering, though.

30
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,910
 Team Leader! 

31
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,440
I thought you two went home.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,710
Our meeting with the Marketing Team ran late.

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,340
By the way, we're getting chicken. Want to join us, Team Leader?

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,300
One second.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,270
   

36
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,050
Hey, Ji Seok. What's with the video call?

37
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,740
- I solved everything. I wanted to show you. 
 - Oh, okay.

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,280
Gosh, all wrong again.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,850
What's the point of solving them if you don't get them right?

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,970
Good job. I'll be home after dinner.

41
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,160
I'm hungry. Can I order chicken fry stew from Yi Rae's?

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,670
Sure. Go ahead.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,440
Chicken fry stew...

44
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,410
- Let's go. 
 - Excuse me.

45
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,250
We were going to get chicken anyway. Can we go to your place?

46
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,640
- What? 
 - I heard your place is close by.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Deputy Bae can help your brother with math. It would be nice!

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,660
True...

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,750
You never threw a housewarming party like you said you would.

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,700
Speaking of...

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,600
- Wait. 
 - Let's go.

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,960
- Yay! 
 - Wait...

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,970
Let's go.

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
- Is that the bathroom? 
 - Yes.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Divide A and C by 3:1.

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,320
Then what's the 3rd degree of A?

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,720
- Divide? 
 - I was going to talk about leaving.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,880
What is this?

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,400
Who is it?

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,900
Wh-What?

61
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Yun Seo.

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,500
I have nowhere to go.

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,750
I left everything behind.

64
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,300
What do you mean?

65
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,400
You're all I have now.

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,660
Weakling?

67
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,440
I thought you broke up. Why are you here again?

68
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,780
Hey, little brother. Do you have the answer sheet to this?

69
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,890
In my day, we didn't learn stuff like this...

70
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,530
Director?

71
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,430
Is the chicken fry stew here?

72
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,300
- Director? 
 - D-Director?

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,600
Is the weakling the third-generation chaebol heir?

74
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Delivery! I heard the company folks were here...

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,900
- What? Are you two back together? 
 - What?

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,700
- Back together? 
 - You two were dating?

77
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,220
 That is how our workplace romance was revealed... 

78
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,950
 after we broke up. 

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,950
   

80
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,760
So, excuse me...

81
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,630
One moment.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,590
Yes, it's true.

83
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,920
We dated for a year and a half

84
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,060
and kept it a secret to avoid making you all feel uncomfortable.

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,450
But we broke up a month ago and are not back together.

86
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,900
I think we should call it a night here. I'm sorry.

87
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,180
- Director. 
 - Yes?

88
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,700
- A word, please. 
 - Yes.

89
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,050
Good night.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,570
What? That was like a briefing.

91
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,090
I thought we were in a meeting.

92
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,880
Right. She's even good at a breakup presentation.

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,310
- A breakup presentation? How can you say that? 
 - Come on now.

94
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,770
The situation is a bit awkward. I think we all know what's going on now.

95
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,140
Why don't you all go home now?

96
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,080
Actually, we haven't had dinner...

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,500
So could we maybe go home after eating the chicken stew?

98
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,990
What?

99
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,790
Just one bite.

100
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,980
Just one bite.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,970
Oh...

102
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,750
This is such a daebak incident.

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,290
We recently found out that Ju Won is part of the owner's family.

104
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,870
And to find out the two of them were dating today?

105
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,770
I'm in such a shock.

106
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,220
Why? I totally predicted this.

107
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,840
During the Yeosu trip, I knew they were 100% flirting!

108
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,300
If they dated for a year and a half, did she know he was a chaebol or not?

109
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,400
I know.

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,700
- Ji Seok, I'm using the bathroom. 
 - Okay.

111
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,420
But you know,

112
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,340
this is what I'm most curious about.

113
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,390
What did the director see in the team leader?

114
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,100
I know, I know!

115
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,500
What's wrong with my sister?

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,480
Well, you don't know this,

117
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,790
but your sister is terrifying at work.

118
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,110
She's terrifying at home, too.

119
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,350
Then you would know.

120
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,380
When Ju Won was new, Team Leader Ha was his direct superior.

121
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,880
She was so critical and picky!

122
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,320
- What does he see in her? 
 - What?

123
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,110
Wait.

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,240
Maybe it's like this.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
 Do you call this a report? 

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,180
 Do you expect me to read this? 

127
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,570
 Be mine. You're the first woman who's yelled at me. 

128
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,200
Seriously? We're eating.

129
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,780
Wh-Why? It's plausible.

130
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,190
When else would Ju Won have been criticized all his life?

131
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,210
A woman who gives him advice and scolds him? Giving him direction.

132
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,720
It must have been so refreshing.

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,140
Refreshing? What?

134
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,570
- So he's definitely a chaebol, right? 
 - Yes.

135
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,570
They dated like high schoolers on an allowance.

136
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,000
I was baffled.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,470
Eating tteobokki and going on walks...

138
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,520
They were so cheap that I almost chipped in.

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,570
Chaebol?

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,110
Then that must've been the key!

141
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,650
 This is real soondae. 

142
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,890
 It's squishy. So excellent. 

143
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,070
 The sauce here is really special. 

144
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,150
 Have some. 

145
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,450
 A day spent with you... 

146
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,940
 is ordinary, yet special. 

147
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,360
Seriously?

148
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,750
Stop imagining my sister like that. It's scary.

149
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,120
Okay.

150
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,680
From now on, please watch what you say around her.

151
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,180
It must be hard to work together after breaking up.

152
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,250
I don't know. She doesn't seem to be struggling.

153
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,730
- We didn't notice at all. 
 - That's what I'm saying.

154
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,830
Little brother, I hate to say this,

155
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,150
but your sister is pretty severe.

156
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,760
You know the saying, "Cold as ice"?

157
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,090
If you personified that saying, that's your sister.

158
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,420
She's not the kind of person who would be heartbroken.

159
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,800
Plus, it looks like the Director is being clingy.

160
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,700
Then he got dumped, heartbroken, and the victim was him, too.

161
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,230
It's not like that.

162
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,100
They broke up because his family opposed them.

163
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,000
Yun Seo was practically threatened by the Chairwoman!

164
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,840
- Is that true? 
 - What?

165
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,590
- Well, that's... 
 - T-Then...

166
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,430
it was like a scene from a melodrama!

167
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,160
 My goodness. Aigoo... 

168
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,610
 Look at how shabby this is... 

169
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,840
 You can guess why I'm here, right? 

170
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,690
 Break up with my son. 

171
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,040
 No. I love Ju Won. 

172
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,830
 - I can't break up with him. 
 - Gosh, don't touch me! 

173
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,650
 Do you know how much this is? 

174
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,260
 Dirty. Dirty. Dirty! 

175
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,600
Dirty!

176
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,770
Stop it, I said!

177
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,730
Dirty? Shabby?

178
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,880
We have debt, but this house is ours!

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,690
How nice is your house that you put down ours, Ahjussi?

180
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,540
I actually rent a studio.

182
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,110
Also, I'm not an ahjussi. I'm your sister's age. I'll stop.

183
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,190
That's right, please stop.

184
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,120
I only told you so weird rumors don't spread at work.

185
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,620
Please pretend like you don't know.

186
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,440
Please take good care of Yun Seo.

187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,550
She struggles, even if she doesn't let it show.

188
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know everyone was here.

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,090
Never mind that.

190
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,890
What do you mean by you left it all behind?

191
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,320
Actually...

192
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,230
it was really tough to hear you talk about quitting.

193
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,620
You decided to quit a job you love because you broke up with me.

194
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,600
But I'm still in my place.

195
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,530
So you'll abandon everything you've got?

196
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,580
What am I supposed to do?

197
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,700
Just watch as you leave behind everything you've worked for?

198
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,970
I won't bring up quitting to my team for a while.

199
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,150
Our current project will wrap up soon.

200
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,270
I'll make sure there are no loose ends, so don't worry.

201
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,230
Good night.

202
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,280
Will you be okay?

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,860
You said you didn't want people to know about us.

204
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,970
We're not together. We broke up.

205
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,510
What are they going to do?

206
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,740
It'll be fine after some time.

207
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,950
What? What's with the vibe?

208
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,050
Everyone's still here.

209
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm leaving.

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,050
B-Bye now.

211
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,790
- I'm also going to leave. 
 - Sure.

212
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,000
Hang in there.

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm rooting for you, Team Leader.

214
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,500
What? What's up with everyone?

215
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,800
Nuna, don't be intimidated.

216
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,780
I know they're chaebols,

217
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,400
but you know you shouldn't be treated poorly, right?

218
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,780
What are you talking about?

219
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,750
I heard everything.

220
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,490
You broke up tragically because his family didn't approve.

221
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,190
What?

222
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,150
Damn it!

223
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,800
- Hello? 
 -  Hey, Kim Irae. 

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
 Why did you tell everyone? In front of Ji Seok, too? 

225
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,330
They kept saying you were fine after the breakup.

226
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,140
They were saying how terrible you are.

227
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,690
 I was just trying to take your side... 

228
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,150
But I didn't tell them you took the chairwoman's money.

229
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,530
Oh, really? Thanks a lot.

230
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,200
Thanks to you, I'll be so embarrassed at work.

231
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,680
 It won't be too embarrassing. 

232
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,220
They're all intelligent people. They wouldn't act so obviously.

233
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,380
Oh, my, I'm getting a call.

234
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,090
I'll call you later. Bye!

235
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,770
 Hey! 

236
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,860
Damn it!

237
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,490
 I left everything behind. 

238
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,450
It won't be too serious, right?

239
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,100
What's with all the food?

240
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,640
Eat a lot so you can be strong.

241
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,870
So was it because of me that they didn't approve?

242
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,210
Because of you?

243
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,610
Did the weakling's family not like you

244
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,170
because you have a brother to take care of?

245
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,700
If so, let me know.

246
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,650
I'm almost 20 and can be independent soon.

247
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,240
Ha Ji Seok. It's not like that at all.

248
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,330
Don't worry about it. Just pretend like you didn't hear it.

249
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,200
I heard it. How can I pretend like I didn't?

250
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,430
You don't want to go to work, huh?

251
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,100
Isn't it annoying to see him at work after breaking up?

252
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,760
Want to play hooky with me today?

253
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,950
Play hooky? Come on.

254
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,490
Eat and go to school.

255
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,820
Okay.

256
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,010
Call me if people at work tease you or make you upset. Okay?

257
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,950
Ji Seok.

258
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,460
Adults live in a different world than you do.

259
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,870
Even if you know someone else's pain or see it,

260
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,310
you act like you don't know or see.

261
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,350
That's the unspoken rule of the world of adults.

262
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,780
So don't worry about it.

263
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,150
 That's what I said confidently... 

264
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, no...

265
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,010
I wasn't crying.

266
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,300
Sure, sure.

267
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,580
It's not that. I really wasn't crying.

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,220
It's dry in here.

269
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,400
Artificial tears. I was putting it in and pressed on it too hard.

270
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,900
I really wasn't crying!

271
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,850
Seriously...

272
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,600
 Yes, these two didn't show me the mercy of pretending not to know. 

273
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,900
 There's a reason why people keep office romances a secret. 

274
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
Director, what do you think of noodles for lunch?

275
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,300
From now on, let us eat lunch together, the two of us.

276
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,890
Team Leader, eat with me later. Just the two of us.

277
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,300
The four of us will never have to eat together again.

278
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,430
Deputy Bae and I decided to split up and watch you two.

279
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,200
So you can rest easy.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
Thanks.

281
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,930
 This is uncomfortable. 

282
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,140
Let's go to the third floor.

283
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,430
The third-floor vending machine is slightly better.

284
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,650
Right, right.

285
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,300
Team Leader, I closed the door fast so the Director couldn't get in.

286
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,200
If you run into him, it'd be awkward.

287
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,100
- Good job. 
 - Good.

288
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,020
Yes. Good work.

289
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,650
 This is so uncomfortable. 

290
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,890
It's the Chairwoman! No, no!

291
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,200
No! No!

292
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,600
What are you doing? Open up!

293
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,900
Team Leader, go up the stairs. The Chairwoman is in the lobby.

294
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,480
What if you run into her in the elevator, and she smacks you?

295
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,900
Run away right now!

296
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,300
I did a big feat just now.

297
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,600
Oh, no. She's coming this way!

298
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,300
Right. The VIP elevator is over there.

299
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,630
Oh, no.

300
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,150
I shouldn't have gotten caught.

301
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,020
I'm suffering in both body and mind. This is bad.

302
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,860
  ­ 

303
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,400
Are you okay?

304
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,400
Aigoo. I'm sorry.

305
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,800
Oh, no.

306
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,800
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay, but...

307
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,330
Let's take a look at the social media trends next.

308
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,040
These days, people around the world are changing quickly.

309
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,540
We need to market social media aggressively to keep up.

310
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,800
Let's take a look at the social media trends.

311
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,340
To build the algorithm and AI in line with current trends...

312
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,690
 Oh, no! I think she ran into the chairwoman and got slapped. 

313
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,900
 I know. This is your fault. What do we do? 

314
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,870
How should we act?

315
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,100
We need to be a step ahead of the change.

316
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,250
It's more effective to communicate via video rather than text,

317
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,900
so we can strategize accordingly.

318
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,400
Next, centering around mobile...

319
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
the user can use the new platform on their mobile device...

320
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,250
centering on their experience...

321
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,800
 It bothers me that you were humiliated in front of your ex-boyfriend because of me. 

322
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,320
 Please accept this as my apology. From the nutjob. 

323
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,000
   

324
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Next, with the progress of AI,

325
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,800
we should look at how users might easily access AI.

326
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,700
Take a look at the next chapter.

327
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,600
   

328
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
 I am so uncomfortable. 

329
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,840
A cup of tea all of a sudden? What's going on?

330
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,000
Just because.

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,740
- I wanted to see your face. It's been a while. 
 - A while?

332
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,300
We saw each other last night.

333
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,990
Where's Ju Won?

334
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,010
He says his client meeting is running late, and he's busy.

335
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,400
Why? Did things with you and Ju Won end badly last night?

336
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,800
Ju Won...

337
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,900
left home.

338
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
What's wrong with you?

339
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,130
I'm sorry. That took me by surprise.

340
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,700
That sweet Seo Ju Won left home?

341
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,000
Did he pack up all his stuff?

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
No, but...

343
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,630
it felt like that.

344
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,080
I knew he and that woman had broken up

345
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,600
and thought that he would struggle a bit.

346
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,220
So...

347
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,900
I thought he just had to get through this.

348
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,780
 Just this one time. 

349
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,060
 Could you be my mother instead of the chairwoman? 

350
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,200
Aigoo.

351
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,970
Ju Won said he's meeting with a live commerce client.

352
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,170
But the calendar says it's tomorrow.

353
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,220
I think Ju Won...

354
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,070
might be avoiding you.

355
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,180
Wow, it's nice in here.

356
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,980
That sofa looks nicer than mine.

357
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,380
What are you doing here?

358
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,940
Just because. I wanted to see you.

359
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,670
Let's go out.

360
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,180
- Before my team gets back. 
 - What are you doing?

361
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,000
- Hey. Are you embarrassed of me? 
 - Yes, I am. Let's go.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,790
- What? 
 - Let's go.

363
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,820
I saw you yesterday. Why did you want to see me again?

364
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,100
- What is it? 
 - What do you think?

365
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm worried about you.

366
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,700
I heard you left home. Where did you sleep?

367
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,030
- A hotel. 
 - Aigoo.

368
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,100
A runaway youth?

369
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,300
Mi Jin happened to be at my place, so I can't even invite you over...

370
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,930
Wait. Want to come to my place?

371
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,500
Maybe it'd be less awkward with three people.

372
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,850
Stop talking nonsense.

373
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,800
Why didn't you tell me Mi Jin was coming home and you were moving to Production?

374
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,800
- You knew. 
 - No, I found out that day.

375
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,900
Mi Jin came back without warning, too.

376
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,900
What? You really don't talk to her at all?

377
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,340
We don't. She kept it a secret from me for the other company.

378
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,620
Hey. When it comes to business, Mi Jin is as intense as our mother.

379
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,230
Sometimes, I feel like I married our mother.

380
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Anyway,

381
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,900
it's not a surprise that you will take my spot.

382
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,470
Don't suffer outside. Go home.

383
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,480
I don't know.

384
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
Is there a place for me to go back to?

385
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm sorry. Should I get an ice pack? It's our fault.

386
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,300
"Our"? I didn't do anything.

387
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,700
What about me? The Chairwoman slapped her.

388
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,260
I'm apologizing as a decent person.

389
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,100
You two, please stop.

390
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm grateful you're thinking of me. Actually, I'm not.

391
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,900
I'd be more grateful if you treated me like before,

392
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,000
so please act like you don't know.

393
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,300
Oh, we...

394
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,800
- just feel bad. 
 - About what?

395
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,700
We dated, then broke up.

396
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,000
Haven't you ever dated before? People break up.

397
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
So many couples at work break up.

398
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,600
Will you be so extra every time that happens?

399
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,150
If you two dated and broke up,

400
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,600
would you want me to bother you and do this?

401
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,300
I think she feels embarrassed that we know about you two.

402
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,700
I'll move my office.

403
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,260
I'm sorry.

404
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,000
It's fine. I'll quit soon. Why bother?

405
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,970
I don't want to stress you out while you're still here.

406
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,190
I set up my office there so I could be near you.

407
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,610
Without you, it's meaningless to me.

408
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,980
So don't worry about it.

409
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,690
I'm so pissed off right now.

410
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,180
- What? 
 - How is everything so easy for you?

411
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,200
Moving the Director's office. Abandoning everything you have.

412
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,120
It seems like you think all of this is very romantic,

413
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,660
but it's not.

414
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,600
It's obnoxious.

415
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,690
Actually, I've been pissed off since yesterday.

416
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,400
I think you're mistaken about something.

417
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,800
An heir leaves his nice family for an ordinary woman, talking about love?

418
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,070
Is there anything more selfish than that?

419
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,630
Have you thought about how she might feel on the sidelines?

420
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,740
A guy who's never lacked anything in his life

421
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,500
has to be poor because of her.

422
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,230
For her, that's devastating.

423
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,700
Then he thinks,

424
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,600
"I love you so much that I could give up everything I have."

425
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,400
But that's only for himself.

426
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,430
- Yun Seo. 
 - Listen to me, Seo Ju Won.

427
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,200
In the future,

428
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,260
if a woman tells you to do that, you dump her.

429
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,100
That's not true love.

430
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,020
How is it so easy for you then?

431
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,010
The thought of you being with someone else...

432
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,740
I can't even imagine it. How can you say that so easily?

433
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,970
Have you ever truly loved me?

434
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,510
I know this path isn't easy.

435
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,500
I know it'll hurt you, but...

436
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,720
I hoped you would hold my hand through it, at least once. But...

437
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,220
you wanted to let go of me so you wouldn't get hurt.

438
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,590
Ever since you learned about my background,

439
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,510
I look like a child only speaking of love to you.

440
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,470
The concerns I have might sound privileged to you,

441
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,410
but I meant it every moment.

442
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:53,780
I've never thought of what I have as purely mine.

443
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,310
Thinking of what I could accomplish by myself, I was curious but scared.

444
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,000
And you were the first person I won over on my own.

445
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,380
That's why I could give up everything else but not you.

446
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,030
We broke up, but I can't get rid of my feelings for you.

447
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,450
I know it's pathetic.

448
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,300
But even now, all I worry about

449
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,290
is how not to hurt you.

450
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,050
How can you treat me this way?

451
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,410
 I was the one making everyone uncomfortable. 

452
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,200
 I have at least two months until I can hand over my duties. 

453
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,780
 Is it okay for everyone to feel uncomfortable? 

454
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,390
Excuse me. Team Leader.

455
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,730
I know this might be a bit inappropriate to bring up,

456
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,370
but I thought I should at least tell you.

457
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,260
- What is it? 
 - Well...

458
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:55,480
there's a headhunter who's wanted to meet you for a long time.

459
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,790
- A headhunter? 
 - Yes.

460
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,910
I don't usually connect people like this, but he's really amazing.

461
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,060
Maybe you could meet him and chat...

462
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,200
Never mind. I shouldn't have.

463
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll meet him.

464
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,070
Really?

465
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,710
He's nearby right now. Do you want to go?

466
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,290
Oh! It's lunchtime!

467
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,050
Go have a little lunch and have a little chat.

468
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,350
But this is so sudden, though...

469
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,600
If you think too hard, you'll just be confused.

470
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,840
He's been begging to meet you forever.

471
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,660
What a great timing!

472
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,960
All right. Let's go. Hurry.

473
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,120
- But... 
 - Let's go.

474
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,580
Here you go.

475
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,250
   

476
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,410
Nice to meet you.

477
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,500
Ah, yes.

478
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,270
It's really nice to meet you.

479
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,750
I've been begging him to let me meet you.

480
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,250
Finally, we're here.

481
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,870
Thank you.

482
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,210
I put this together at the last minute, so it's not my best.

483
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:15,170
   

484
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,530
Why did you...

485
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,930
What do you mean?

486
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,790
Is this what people do these days?

487
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,430
Then how do they do it?

488
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,900
I have never had someone bring a resume to a blind date.

489
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,680
What?

490
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,650
A blind date?

491
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,180
What do you mean by a blind date out of nowhere?

492
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,470
No, listen.

493
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,600
The best way to heal from heartbreak is new love.

494
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,030
That's why I set it up, but then I felt bad about the director.

495
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,380
I thought maybe not, so I retracted,

496
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,310
but she wanted to go!

497
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,490
I was surprised.

498
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,080
Oh, my, my, my.

499
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,760
Maybe she wanted to get over him fast.

500
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,940
Going on a blind date that came up on the same day-

501
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,800
- He heard, right? 
 - I think so.

502
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,240
I'm sorry. Please pretend like you didn't see it.

503
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,790
- I didn't realize this was a blind date. 
 - No, no.

504
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:46,290
I'm sorry. I feel like I took away your precious time.

505
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,950
I saw your pictures on social media.

506
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,840
I've been asking him to introduce me to you for a while.

507
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,750
I think something got lost in translation because of my job.

508
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,270
I'm sorry.

509
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,270
Could you not mention the resume to Deputy Bae?

510
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,790
I don't want people to know that I'm thinking about leaving.

511
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,640
Oh, of course. Don't worry.

512
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
Okay.

513
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,830
- Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

514
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,500
I guess I'm thankful that you misunderstood.

515
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,200
- Otherwise, I wouldn't have met you. 
 - Pardon?

516
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,900
We're already here spending our precious time.

517
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,140
Could we chat as if this is a blind date?

518
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,600
What?

519
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,170
- Have some of this. 
 - Oh, sure...

520
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,400
What kind of food do you like, Yun Seo?

521
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,810
I like spicy food.

522
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,100
Oh, spicy food.

523
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,230
I can't really eat spicy foods.

524
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:01,840
It hurts my stomach. Honestly, I don't get why people eat it.

525
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,350
- Sure. 
 - But you like it.

526
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,720
 - Is it good? 
 - Yes. 

527
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,430
♫  If I were you, what would I do?  ♫

528
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,380
What do you like to do on your day off?

529
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,660
Do you have any hobbies?

530
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,620
I like watching movies.

531
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,820
- Horror and stuff. 
 - Horror?

532
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:33,230
Wow. I hate stuff that jump-scares you.

533
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,200
I can't really watch stuff like that. That's incredible.

534
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,700
♫  You're feeling down  ♫

535
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,360
 So scary. 

536
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,970
♫  Gonna take down all the way  ♫

537
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:56,200
But if the person you like enjoys it,

538
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:02,000
you could eat and watch it with them. Don't you think?

539
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,710
Or you could do something that both of you enjoy.

540
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,350
Do you need to do something that one of you dislikes?

541
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,590
That's what I thought, but...

542
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,250
Right?

543
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,310
♫  If you were I, what would you do?  ♫

544
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,860
♫  Then try to see where I'm in  ♫

545
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,320
 I wasn't white-knuckling myself through things I hated. 

546
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,400
 Thanks to you, there are more things I enjoy. 

547
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,920
♫  Between us  ♫

548
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,170
 Small daily things connect back to Ju Won and hurt me. 

549
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,700
 You wanted to let go of me so you wouldn't get hurt. 

550
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,200
 Until now, I just thought I was a realistic person. 

551
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,050
 But I was selfish. 

552
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:04,220
 I pretended to be realistic, so I wouldn't get hurt. 

553
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,730
 I avoided it and neglected it. 

554
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,300
I think that would be better.

555
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:18,300
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

556
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,220
Oh, no, Team Leader, the Director knows everything.

557
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,590
- What? 
 - That you went on a blind date.

558
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,590
- He found out. 
 - What?

559
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,910
 When I decided to break up with him, I had planned 

560
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:54,310
 to make him lose feelings for me gradually. 

561
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,610
 Let's not make excuses. 

562
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,670
 There's no such thing as a good breakup. This is good. 

563
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,050
 It might be better for both of us if he hated me. 

564
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,390
 But still... 

565
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,270
 when I face him, my heart keeps... 

566
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,120
Wow, I've never seen Team Leader take the day off.

567
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,660
We should have left her alone as she told us to.

568
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,500
We wanted to help so badly and inserted ourselves...

569
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,710
I think we made it worse for her.

570
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,270
Shit!

571
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,850
It's not shit. Why are you cursing?

572
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,450
No, the artist Park Jong Seo, who's featured in our hanok stay...

573
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,840
- There's a plagiarism scandal! 
 - What?

574
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,620
Shit!

575
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,230
   

576
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,690
   

577
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,520
This guy...

578
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,180
   

579
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,000
 Hey! 

580
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,970
Why are you driving like that?

581
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,680
You did an illegal U-turn first!

582
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,970
- Me? 
 - What?

583
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,630
This is nothing! Be sensible.

584
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,690
It seems like anyone can drive these days, even the bad ones.

585
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,000
- What a nice world. 
 - Bad driver?

586
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Do you know me? You can't talk down to me like that.

587
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,040
Aigoo! Look at you, you young thing!

588
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,350
Thanks for calling me young, but I'm not that young.

589
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:06,480
Even if I am, you can't speak to someone like that.

590
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,050
It doesn't look like you're hurt, so just let it go and leave.

591
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,510
You're lucky to be out playing in the middle of the day.

592
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,930
I'm busy as hell. What a crappy day.

593
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,110
I'm not lucky! My life is really exhausting!

594
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,090
It was tough to make a living, so I worked when others were relaxing.

595
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,100
Do you even know how deep labor is in my DNA?

596
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,670
I went to work every day, experiencing every kind of humiliation.

597
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,780
This is the first half-day I'm taking off since I started this job.

598
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,040
Do you even know how I feel?

599
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,900
So, between two people who are desperate to make a living, let's stop fighting.

600
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,570
Geez...

601
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,390
 ­  

602
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,330
Hello?

603
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,830
 Hi there. 

604
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,300
Are you kidding me right now?

605
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,350
What? How did I answer the call?

606
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,700
I wouldn't know.

607
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,610
I clicked "call" by accident.

608
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,830
But then you were screaming and fighting.

609
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,420
It was too funny to hang up.

610
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,060
 This crazy idiot! 

611
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,590
Excuse me. Delete my number.

612
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,530
Don't call me or text me.

613
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,290
   

614
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,980
   

615
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,350
   

616
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,470
 The call is not going through. 

617
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,820
She's not answering. I think she turned off her phone.

618
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,710
What do we do? The exhibit opens on Monday!

619
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:02,140
Right. Remember Team Leader Ha's address from yesterday?

620
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,690
Should we stop by her place?

621
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,600
I don't know if she'll be home.

622
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,010
We told the director. He'll take care of it somehow, right?

623
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,680
How is he going to take care of it?

624
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,200
Just a few months ago, he was learning the ropes from us.

625
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,500
Right.

626
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,410
I took care of the urgent matters first.

627
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,730
I called the hanok stay to start loading out the exhibit.

628
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,340
I got his name deleted from all press materials that went out.

629
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,980
We didn't know, so the marketing team will take action.

630
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,270
Legal has started looking into damages.

631
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,500
Let's find a different artist to feature instead.

632
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,190
Okay. S-Sure.

633
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,760
We can't leave the gallery empty on opening day.

634
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,470
The next exhibit is in three months, right?

635
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,810
Please get me a list of all the upcoming exhibits.

636
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,420
Sure.

637
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,540
So the pieces for the exhibit in three months

638
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,400
are in the UK and can't come in.

639
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,830
The pieces for the next one are in a different exhibit,

640
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:04,400
so it's not possible.

641
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,700
How about contacting Lee Seong Min, the traditional Korean artist we originally wanted?

642
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,260
Team Leader Ha tried for months, and he turned us down.

643
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,490
He won't say yes to a last-minute substitute offer.

644
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,470
Please think a bit more before you speak.

645
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,770
Let me call him directly.

646
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:27,280
- See? 
 - How will you call him directly?

647
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,630
It took us months to get his agency to talk to us.

648
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,470
I think I can find out.

649
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,740
Oh, okay...

650
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,000
See you.

651
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,660
Geez, what was that?

652
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,580
How is he going to find out? Hire a private investigator or something?

653
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,100
A private investigator or whatnot, I hope it gets handled somehow.

654
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:58,990
But where is the Team Leader at this important moment?

655
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,090
Seriously...

656
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,020
If I go home, Ji Seok will be worried.

657
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,570
If I go to Yi Rae's, I might binge drink.

658
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,400
The sky is so pretty for no reason.

659
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,330
- What? You got Artist Lee Seong Min? 
 - Yes.

660
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:41,930
I told him we'll go to his studio to select the pieces right away.

661
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,350
Wh-When you were a newbie, you didn't do so well.

662
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,240
But why now?

663
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,740
I know someone who knows him.

664
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,030
I heard that he couldn't do an exhibit before,

665
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,650
but his situation changed recently.

666
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,650
Let's get ready and go right away.

667
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:01,440
What about the Team Leader?

668
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,100
Right. The hanok stay is under Team Leader Ha's perview.

669
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:09,640
- To make a big decision without talking to her... 
 - We can't help it.

670
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,800
She left her post.

671
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,410
We'll have to be responsible.

672
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,820
 You really don't talk to her at all? 

673
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:41,480
   

674
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,490
- Hello. 
 -  What's up? 

675
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,960
- What are you doing this evening? 
 - Dinner.

676
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,450
-  Let's have dinner together.  
 - Together?

677
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,060
- Okay. See you at seven then. 
 - Okay.

678
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,270
- I want Chinese. 
 - Steak. I'll send you the address.

679
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,530
 ­  

680
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,780
What? Did she hang up?

681
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,270
Wow. How can she be like that?

682
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:09,680
She comes and goes and picks the menu as she pleases.

683
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,070
Fine.

684
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,480
We can't stay like this.

685
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,340
I need to settle this today.

686
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,080
Executive Director is already here. This way, please.

687
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,130
- You made it. 
 - Huh?

688
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,650
 Hello. 

689
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,890
Yes. Hello.

690
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:07,750
 ­  

691
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,330
What is this? What is this situation?

692
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,760
I should ask you that. You asked me to dinner. Why are you surprised?

693
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,370
- I meant the two of us! 
 - Then you should have said that.

694
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,100
I said I was going to dinner. You said you wanted to join,

695
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,330
so I invited you to where I was going.

696
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:33,350
How's that possible? If you had plans, you should have said that.

697
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,150
That's why I said I was going to dinner.

698
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,900
If I didn't have plans, I'd have said I was going home.

699
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,560
Wow. This is how badly we communicate.

700
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,420
I mean, we don't talk so how would we pick up on such nuance?

701
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,050
Well, I've already said hello. Let me pay, and I'll go.

702
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:51,270
We can talk at home.

703
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:55,250
You're just leaving? You came all this way and won't eat?

704
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,640
You probably don't know this,

705
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,810
but I'm shy.

706
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,580
 I'm Seo Ju Won, AL Group's Marketing Director. 

707
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,670
Hello. The artist would like you to look at the pieces first.

708
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:23,680
- Does that work? 
 - Yes, of course.

709
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,920
A non-vibrating car will arrive at the studio by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

710
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,190
A packaging company will be here soon, and we'll all help.

711
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,380
- Don't worry too much. 
 - Yes.

712
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,790
By the way, the artist is a bit sensitive about the display lighting.

713
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:42,090
I know. The lighting company can meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

714
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,280
Does that time work?

715
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,590
How did you manage to get them so soon?

716
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,260
Very cool.

717
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,850
Vice Chairman. Can we help you with anything?

718
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,660
Would you like some wine?

719
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,860
I'm okay. I'll do it myself, don't worry.

720
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,650
All right.

721
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,640
Being alone was more comfortable.

722
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,050
You're home early.

723
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,330
Yes. We just said bye after dinner.

724
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,570
If you were going to eat that, you should have had dinner there.

725
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:35,260
What did you want to talk about at home?

726
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,480
There are things we need to sort out.

727
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,840
Sort out? Sort out what?

728
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,400
Things we've excused because we didn't live together.

729
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,440
But we need to live together and work together in many aspects.

730
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,620
How is it that we can't handle basic communication like today?

731
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,280
Right.

732
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,980
As a family, as roommates, and as business partners,

733
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,420
I'd like to set some rules.

734
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:05,810
Okay. Fine.

735
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,030
I think we need that, too.

736
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,570
This is what I need most. No more sudden announcements.

737
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,080
Announcements...

738
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,340
I know we didn't stay connected often,

739
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,950
but you could've told me you were leaving France and coming to Korea for good.

740
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:31,430
I see. But my dad notified me once I got to Korea.

741
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,280
- Really? 
 - Yes.

742
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,340
Then you should have told me that so I would have been less confused.

743
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,470
It's business, but I also share a space with you. I should know.

744
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,360
Okay. I was inconsiderate regarding that.

745
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,640
I thought you'd be busy, so I wanted to tell you once things were decided.

746
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,230
But it may have seemed like an "announcement" to you.

747
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,460
And, actually...

748
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,220
I thought you didn't like staying in touch with me.

749
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,990
Well, I don't really like staying in touch,

750
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,150
but I don't dislike it, either.

751
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,060
Then...

752
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,130
should we keep in touch?

753
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,320
How often?

754
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,800
Once a day, a call, text, or KakaoTalk. Pick one. What do you think?

755
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,310
We can share our schedules or communicate any changes.

756
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,960
Sounds good.

757
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,730
How about you?

758
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,270
Do you have any proposals to make?

759
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:38,350
I'm not getting pregnant for the next three years, at least.

760
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,400
S-Sure. As for that, we can keep separate bedrooms like now.

761
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,300
Also, this house might appear on my social media.

762
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,600
You know everything I wear and use is business, right?

763
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,520
I know. We agreed on that when we got married.

764
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,670
We also agreed to never show my face.

765
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:06,080
I know very well that you're banned from social media after the crying selfie accident.

766
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,110
Well, that's...

767
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,500
Then let's consider the deal done.

768
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,840
- Let's shake on it. 
 - Okay.

769
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,270
I know we didn't marry for love,

770
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,410
but I hope we're not uncomfortable with one another.

771
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,340
I know we had to marry because of our families' agreement.

772
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:41,090
No. I married you because you're not so bad.

773
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,650
On the plane, I thought you were all right.

774
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,900
Do you need anything?

775
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,870
I'm okay.

776
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,250
Then...

777
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,270
you fell for my tender, sweet side?

778
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,790
F-Fell? No.

779
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,970
I thought you were all right. Don't be delusional.

780
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,500
That woman sure has good taste.

781
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,220
A guy like me...

782
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,380
That was a very successful conversation.

783
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,750
 Yay! 

784
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,850
What time is it?

785
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,170
   

786
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,570
 Team Leader, where are you? It's an emergency! 

787
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,660
 We need to take down all the paintings in the hanok stay. 

788
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,740
 Team Leader, did you read the article? Please call us. 

789
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,790
- I'm sorry. You've been through a lot. 
 - Team Leader!

790
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,440
We just followed orders. It was a lot for the director.

791
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,830
Dealing with the press, contracting the artist, selecting pieces,

792
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:35,030
even booking the packaging company.

793
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,480
He must have learned well from me.

794
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,290
He dealt with everything so well under such pressure.

795
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,120
Keep going.

796
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,060
I'm sorry.

797
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,110
I didn't think something like this would happen.

798
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,790
You said there would be no loose ends and that I shouldn't worry.

799
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,580
You take half a day off all of a sudden and go off the grid?

800
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,370
I didn't realize you were this irresponsible.

801
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,850
I'm disappointed.

802
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:39,080
♫  Your scent is inside me  ♫

803
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:45,800
♫  You shake up my entire heart  ♫

804
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,330
♫  My eyes are covered, so I can't see  ♫

805
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:55,110
 I thought it would be okay if he hated me. 

806
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,280
 But it feels strange and sad. 

807
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,980
♫  Like this  ♫

808
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:08,100
♫  You must have grown inside me  ♫

809

811

♫  My heart should fade  ♫

812

♫  Inside me  ♫

813
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,960
All done.

814
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,660
♫  I can't end this like I want to  ♫

815
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,960
 I didn't know that being hated by him 

816
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,730
 would hurt me so much. 

817
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,720
I think we're done eating. Should we get started?

818
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,090
Yes.

819
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,470
The artist is here.

820
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,980
Hello.

821
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,580
I'm Seo Ju Won. I've heard so much about you.

822
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,900
Yes, nice to meet you.

823
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,890
I know we asked out of nowhere. Thank you for saying yes.

824
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,700
It wasn't out of nowhere.

825
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,970
I've read the proposals you've been sending for six months.

826
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:57,200
I thought it was a great offer, but I wasn't able to show my work.

827
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,720
That's why I wasn't able to say yes.

828
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,290
I'm sorry for saying no, Team Leader Ha Yun Seo.

829
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:10,700
It's all right. It's an honor to work together.

830
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,840
An honor? No way.

831
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:18,190
Desperate people trying to make a living should help each other.

832
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:29,810


833
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,560
When you arrive, the employee will show you the way.

834
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,100
Thank you in advance.

835
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,700
Thank you.

836
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,350
We'll be on our way, then.

837
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,910
Travel safe!

838
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,260
You were up all night. Get some rest over the weekend, and see you on Monday.

839
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,410
Team Leader, you said you left your car at Han River.

840
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,220
You must need a taxi.

841
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,290
- Come with me. 
 - Sure.

842
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:04,780
We'll get going, then.

843
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,700
See you on Monday.

844
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,530
- Should we go, too? 
 - Yes.

845
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,870
Excuse me, Director.

846
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:19,130
Please don't scold her too much for going off the grid.

847
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:23,830
She must be really struggling to take a half day off and turn off her phone.

848
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:28,920
Actually, when we found out about you two, we went overboard.

849
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,400
- What? 
 - Well...

850
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,620
we found out that the chairwoman didn't approve of you two.

851
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,510
We pushed her into the emergency stairwell so she wouldn't run into the chairwoman,

852
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,690
then she got slapped by the janitor.

853
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,830
That's why I set up the blind date on my own.

854
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:51,180
Anyway, I feel bad because it's partly my responsibility that she took a half day off.

855
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,170
I felt guilty.

856
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,940
It seemed like you were having an important conversation.

857
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,350
All right, then.

858
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,740
 Thank you for saying yes to our sudden offer. 

859
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,810
 We will see through the project to support young artists, as you mentioned. 

860
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:34,480
 See you at the studio. 

861
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,880
 - Will Team Leader Ha Yun Seo be there later? 
 - Pardon? 

862
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,940
 I think she's kind of fun. 

863
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:52,360
 I'm sorry for saying no, Team Leader Ha Yun Seo. 

864
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:29,520
 I didn't realize you were this irresponsible. I'm disappointed. 

865
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,350
Why do you look so down?

866
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,240
You seem like a combative person.

867
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,590
I sent you too many emails, didn't I?

868
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,490
See you later, then.

869
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,410
Are you hungry?

870
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,440
Excuse me?

871
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,090
How does gukbap* and soju sound?
  (*Korean soup with rice) 

872
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:14,300
Is it too early in the day for soju?

873
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,600
It's not that it's early.

874
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:23,390
I don't think it's appropriate for me to drink with you alone.

875
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,250
It's an honor to work with you,

876
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,160
but I don't want to have personal conversations.

877
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,400
Geez! This idiot!

878
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,560
I'm marking him as spam.

879
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,860
   

880
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,280
It hurts that you would mark me as spam in front of me.
    

881
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,240
You knew from the start?

882
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,740
How did you know that was my number–

883
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,950
I mean, how did you know what I look like?

884
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:12,130
So let's eat together. I'll explain.

885
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,250
Hey...

886
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,530
Does time really help?

887
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,880
Is that day really going to come?

888
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,850
Yun Seo.

889
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,060
I can't see you being with someone else.

890
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,320
There's no one else for me, either.

891
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,430
Even if...

892
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:00,820
on a day far away,

893
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,790
I won't be with anyone else.

894
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,780
As long as you exist.

 She seems cold but has a fun side. 

901
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,810
 I'm interested in her. 

902
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,550
 Don't hang onto a relationship that's over. Focus on work. 

903
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:59,530
 I don't believe in fate, but I almost did this time. 

904
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:04,020
 I'll help you. Go to the staff dinner right now and get her. 

905
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,050
 It's not like he likes me. 

906
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:10,580
 Why did you follow me all the way from Jeju? So extra!
