1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,330
   

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,380
   

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,280
   

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,940
   

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,260
   

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:35,220


7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,000
   

8
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,320
   

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,130
What's up this early in the morning?

10
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,450
I saw the article, and I was stunned. Is Ju Won okay?

11
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,710
The article?

12
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,470
What about Ju Won?

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,500
Yun Seo, I need to go to Seoul right away.

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,600
I'll call you later.

15
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,890
 It was revealed that AL Global CEO Seo Dong Jin, 

16
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,570
 the spouse of AL Group Chairwoman Kim Seon Ju, 

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,150
 has been living with a woman in New York for the past two years, 

18
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,960
 shocking the public. 

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,260
 CEO Seo stated that his marriage with Chairwoman Kim 

20
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,990
 was already in shambles before he left for New York. 

21
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,260
 The conflict began after he lost the general election. 

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,430
 Their marriage has been for show for decades, 

23
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,040
 and all that remains between them is distrust. 

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,890
 The divorce trial of the century is expected to take place... 

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,910
I understand. Please handle it one more time.

26
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,460
Yes.

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
What happened?

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,750
Father asked for a divorce, and Mother is preparing to sue.

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,060
Did you know?

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,150
I had a feeling, but I didn't know he would go to the press.

31
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,100
Public opinion is turning against her, as he intended.

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,000
How about Mother? Where is she?

33
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,550
You must have been surprised that I asked to see you.

34
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,000
Let me get straight to the point.

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,150
You have my permission

36
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,200
to marry Ju Won.

37
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,500
But under one condition.

38
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,340
I want you to take care of our scholarship foundation.

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,400
Scholarship foundation?

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,860
Arranged marriages and power tripping...

41
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,590
The talk about my family is not so great right now.

42
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,420
I need something to help recover our image.

43
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,480
So let's reveal your background and proceed with the wedding.

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,890
Go ahead...

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,390
and live as a true Cinderella.

46
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,240
   

47
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,850
A scholarship foundation?

48
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,340
Wow, daebak.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,600
So you're going to be an executive director? Someone high up?

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,330
It would be strange for AL Group's youngest daughter-in-law to go somewhere else.

51
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,010
Even if you did, it would make people uncomfortable.

52
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,480
It's not realistic.

53
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,330
But to be in charge of the scholarship foundation,

54
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,190
I need to reveal my family history.

55
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,060
What? Why?

56
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,040
Because the company isn't in a good place right now.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,020
What? Chaebol power play, that kind of thing?

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,700
That's about the guy who cheated

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,230
and justified it by saying that the chaebol power play hurt his ego.

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,020
Still, people sympathize with him.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,340
So since I grew up in an ordinary, or rather in a poor environment,

62
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,870
and if I marry Ju Won, she thinks it will help their image.

63
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,150
That's crazy! Are you okay with that?

64
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,310
My family history isn't my fault.

65
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,430
I feel okay about it.

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,280
But I'm worried about Ji Seok.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,620
Right. Ji Seok wouldn't feel good about that kind of press.

68
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,690
But your background will be revealed eventually, anyway.

69
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,430
And people will say you married up.

70
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,560
If you get ahead of the story,

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,160
it would at least help the packaging. So-

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,550
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,830
Hey, Ji Seok.

74
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,760
He was stopping by to get some utensils, and here we are.

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,020
Come in, Ji Seok. Have you eaten?

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,170
Hey, Ji Seok!

77
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,690
J-Ji Seok!

78
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,140
I'm heading out.

79
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,950
Ji Seok!

80
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,890
Ji Seok!

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,520
   

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,260
   

83
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,360
 It's Ha Ji Seok. 

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,540
 If I go to AL Card, can I see you? 

85
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,380
   

86
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,060
Hey, what's going on?

87
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,660
I should be asking you what this is about.

88
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,370
Is this why you're seeing my sister again?

89
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,580
To sell our past and use it?

90
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,100
Are my sister's painful memories just an opportunity for you?

91
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,040
What are you...

92
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,780
You want to cover up your family's power play story with my sister.

93
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,170
To make you seem like a chaebol taking in a poor girl!

94
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,390
What?

95
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,990
You didn't know that the Chairwoman asked her that?

96
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,750
If you didn't know, that's a problem, too.

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,420
I didn't think you'd be here...

98
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,220
Go home. I'll explain everything later.

99
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,140
There's nothing to explain. I heard everything, and I won't accept it.

100
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,000
Why would you get married being treated like this? I'm proud of you!

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,850
- Go home. Let's talk at home. Hurry. 
 - Let go.

102
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,200
Isn't that your brother?

103
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,600
- Let go! 
 - Hurry.

104
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,160
Hey, Seo Ju Won.

105
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,820
What's going on?

106
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,710
Really?

107
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,860
Did our mother really make you that offer?

108
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,250
How rude.

109
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,190
I apologize on behalf of her.

110
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,400
Where are you going?

111
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,410
You know where.

112
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,360
Why are you stopping me? Do you want me to stay still again?

113
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,890
Why do you keep making a fool out of me?

114
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,530
I'm not making a fool out of you.

115
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,580
Let's just not create the worst-case scenario.

116
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,300
My mother is the one who did that, not me.

117
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,720
Don't you see?

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,050
You don't need to be emotional about it.

119
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,930
I understand the chairwoman.

120
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,020
Understand what? Why are you always so understanding?

121
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,560
She seemed on the edge.

122
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,430
She seemed like someone standing on a cliff's edge.

123
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,550
She came to see me first while articles were coming out attacking her.

124
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,480
That's how desperate she was.

125
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,580
I understand you're angry.

126
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,760
You can be angry any time.

127
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,680
But...

128
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,870
this is the only time you get to console her.

129
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,950
The chairwoman is at a cliff's edge.

130
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,650
I don't want you to push her over.

131
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,760
I want you to just embrace her.

132
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,670
That's family.

133
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,630
   

134
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,570
   

135
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,140
My goodness.

136
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,280
Why are they asking me about her? I'm not the director's assistant!

137
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,230
I would've just considered it the chairwoman's business before.

138
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,140
But knowing she's the mother of someone I know, I feel bad.

139
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,130
I know! Imagine the whole country knowing your parents are getting divorced because your dad cheated.

140
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,300
My goodness!

141
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,920
By the way, this is a secret,

142
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,580
but after I got promoted, I bought some of our stocks.

143
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,340
I felt like I could make our company soar.

144
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,850
But our stocks wouldn't go down because of this, right?

145
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,070
They can't go down...

146
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,420
I meant my buttons!

147
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,260
I tried to copy you but bought the cheap ones...

148
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,150
What's going on? Did something happen?

149
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,020
I think something's happening to me.

150
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,620
He didn't hear me talk about stocks, right?

151
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,340
What if I get demoted now that I got promoted?

152
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,490
What did you want to talk about?

153
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't take Mother's side.

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,660
Hey, she's indefensible, but

155
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,340
I think Yun Seo is right.

156
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,730
Let's put away the anger,

157
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,620
and why don't we be her family right now?

158
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,010
I know she's never been a mother to us,

159
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,960
but we've never been good to her as sons, either.

160
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,890
Actually, Mi Jin invited Mother to our place once after you moved out.

161
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,670
Because she seemed lonely.

162
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,240
Mi Jin sees our mother's vulnerable side, and so does Yun Seo.

163
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,260
I think her sons are the only ones who don't.

164
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,910
   

165
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,640
Mother.

166
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,480
Oh?

167
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,620
What are you two doing here at this hour?

168
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,160
If you're worried about inheritance,

169
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,690
I'll make sure he doesn't touch yours.

170
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,780
Don't worry.

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,870
Let's go on a trip, Mother.

172
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,570
- A trip? 
 - Yes.

173
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,710
Let's go and get some fresh air.* 
  (Idiom in Korean for having an affair) 

174
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,190
Fresh air?

175
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,940
Man, how can you be so harsh? You can't say that!

176
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,420
Mother. Forget the fresh air but get a change of scenery.

177
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,160
No thanks.

178
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,170
I have so much to take care of. I have no time.

179
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,200
Do it later. Let's cool our heads first.

180
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,700
- Hey, get her clothes. 
 - Okay.

181
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,540
Oh, my! Hey!

182
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,210
What...

183
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,400
Aigoo! Boys!

184
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,030
I'll get her legs!

185
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,170
So light!

186
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,530
Where are we going?

187
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,600
You'll find out!

188
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,620
- What are you doing? 
 - You'll see!

189
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,030
♫  Please wait  ♫

190
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,270
♫  A moment with you  ♫

191
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,840
♫  Just gonna be alright  ♫

192
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,840
♫  Even without words, I can tell from your face  ♫

193
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,210
This is awkward.

194
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,190
Right? You've always sat in the back.

195
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,130
Not that.

196
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,480
Getting fresh air with you two– I mean...

197
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,630
Going for a change of scenery.

198
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,780
- So unfamiliar. 
 - I'm sure.

199
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,170
We're probably the only family who's never had a trip like this.

200
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,700
But Mother, I've been too busy to do this,

201
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,210
but I've been worried about you more than anyone.

202
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,310
Hey, Seo Ju Won. Don't sit there like you're the boss.

203
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,450
Take out the bento box.

204
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,600
- A bento box? 
 - Yes.

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,330
Do you want to eat in the car?

206
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,170
I thought you might be hungry on the way.

207
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,200
I asked Manager Park to prepare something simple.

208
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,340
A special shrimp sandwich, your favorite.

209
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,870
- Shrimp? 
 - Sounds good, right?

210
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,670
I don't eat shrimp these days because of my cholesterol.

211
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,530
Didn't you know?

212
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,820
How about tomato juice? Good for your skin.

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,670
Hey, tomato juice.

214
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,740
Tomato?

215
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,580
I don't like tomatoes because of the texture.

216
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,600
Didn't you know?

217
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,080
Mother, how can you still be so picky about food?

218
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,340
You need to eat everything to grow...

219
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,100
I guess you're all grown up.

220
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,710
Then let's have a nice meal once we get there.

221
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,780
At the scenic beach.

222
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,220
- The beach? 
 - Yes.

223
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,060
I've been traumatized by the ocean ever since I almost fell off a yacht.

224
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,150
Didn't you know?

225
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,730
Well...

226
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,430
We can get to know each other slowly.

227
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,100
Let's try to do that today.

228
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,580
Then never mind the beach. What mountain is nearby?

229
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,320
Hyeong, should we listen to the radio or something?

230
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,600
Great idea. Mother, you like listening to the news.

231
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,860
   

232
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,110
 Let's go over the current issues. 

233
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,810
 People are busy talking about the "divorce of the century" from AL Group. 

234
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,200
 What are your thoughts? 

235
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,990
What?

236
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,750
Why isn't the car accelerating?

237
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,560
You're out of gas.

238
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,060
What?

239
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,410
What?

240
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,590
What...

241
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,610
What just happened...

242
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,160
Okay, got it.

243
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,350
Mr. Kim will be here soon.

244
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,050
Insurance or Mr. Kim, we'll wait for whoever gets here first.

245
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,400
How can you not even know that you're out of gas?

246
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,970
I never fill up the tank.

247
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,440
I've never worried about gas in my life.

248
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,400
I think we need to move the car over there.

249
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,970
Can we do that?

250
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,520
If you and Mother help push it.

251
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,750
What? Do you want me to push the car?

252
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,900
It'll be hard for Ju Won alone.

253
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,550
- How about you? 
 - I'll have to steer.

254
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:22,470
I don't want you to push the car, but you don't have a license.

255
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,490
You can't drive because you're traumatized by an accident at age seven.

256
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,900
Oh, my. You remember stuff like that so well.

257
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,750
You're mistaken.

258
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,510
Hey! Push harder!

259
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,460
Mother! Harder!

260
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,820
That scoundrel...

261
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,180
More! One, two! One, two!

262
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,290
One, two! One, two!

263
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,790
Just a little more!

264
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,940
A little more!

265
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,700
Okay, okay!

266
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,850
Okay! Mother, that's enough!

267
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,780
- Done? 
 - Yes.

268
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,880
My back!

269
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,450
W-Why are you smiling?

270
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,380
I'm just in disbelief. Should I get a picture of you?

271
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,070
What? Don't take it. Don't!

272
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,420
Let's get a photo, Mom!

273
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,140
One, two, three!

274
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,520
- You guys. Stop! 
 - One, two, three!

275
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,390
Let's take one altogether.

276
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,310
Don't, don't! Boys, don't.

277
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,760
One, two, three!

278
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,850
Boys, come on...

279
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,680
Mother, have some.

280
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,700
It's not your favorite Jamaica Blue Mountain

281
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,990
but it's pretty sweet.

282
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,530
Don't you know I'm watching my glucose levels?

283
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,820
Of course, you don't.

284
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,680
Let me know if I can help with the lawsuit.

285
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll help as much as I can.

286
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,600
The lawyers will handle it.

287
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,160
It'll be different coming from a family member.

288
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,960
I'm on your side, too.

289
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,860
I want you to be happy.

290
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,700
Thank you.

291
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,510
I haven't had anything to eat.

292
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,670
They're selling toast over there. Should I get some?

293
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,190
No, no toast. I don't like street food.

294
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,870
But you drank all the coffee.

295
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,900
I'll get some. Just wait a second.

296
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,100
- Whose idea was this? 
 - Pardon?

297
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,510
Getting fresh air, I mean, a change of scenery.

298
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,120
I know it wasn't your idea. Whose was it? Mi Jin?

299
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,930
Yun Seo.

300
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,760
I met her yesterday.

301
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,000
I told her I'd allow the marriage

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,380
if she took care of our scholarship foundation.

303
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,630
If we use the story of her overcoming her poor background,

304
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,120
I thought it could help our company's image.

305
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,760
Did you know?

306
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,240
I happened to find out.

307
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,260
Yun Seo said...

308
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,180
I can always be angry,

309
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,660
but I only get to console you now.

310
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,500
That's family.

311
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,800
It might sound like an excuse,

312
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,640
but I thought that if she was becoming family anyway, I could put her where we need her.

313
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,090
Prioritizing what's good for the company

314
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,670
was so obvious to me, but she said...

315
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:46,960
 Even if I end up leading the scholarship foundation, 

316
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,070
 please don't let Ju Won find out 

317
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,950
 about revealing my family history. 

318
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,250
 And don't let him find out who the source is, even if there's an article. 

319
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,060
 Why? 

320
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,210
 Ju Won will be worried. 

321
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,250
 He'll feel bad. 

322
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,340
 I only thought of the company, but she... 

323
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,070
only thought of you.

324
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,410
It made me wonder if I made the wrong offer.

325
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,070
I've been embarrassed about it.

326
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,530
A happy family...

327
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,050
I've never had that myself.

328
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,300
That's why I couldn't give it to you two.

329
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,220
But I think she can.

330
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,790
Tell her to forget about revealing her family history.

331
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,250
Get married...

332
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,600
as soon as possible.

333
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,040
Maybe...

334
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
it'll help bury my story a bit.

335
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,650
Can I ask for just that?

336
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,190
Mother!

337
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,500
Aigoo! Come on.

338
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,540
- Have one. 
 - Thank you.

339
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,920
Cheers!

340
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,080
   

341
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,110
Did you sleep well?

342
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,660
Come on...

343
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,640
What do you think?

344
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,180
You should've gone home after the meeting! Why did you drink so much?

345
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,510
You have your own room here. Sleep there!

346
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:14,230
Hey. Once you get married, you'll never sleep in the same bed with me again.

347
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,390
I managed to convince Mi Jin that once you're married,

348
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,800
I won't be able to spend time with you like this even if I want to.

349
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,300
Exactly.

350
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,380
Why did you convince her?

351
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm cold. Give me the blanket.

352
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,850
- Go! 
 - Why?

353
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,430
- Get out! 
 - Stop it!

354
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,030
I'm going to catch a cold!

355
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,500
   

356
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,420
Hello.

357
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,410
   

358
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,190
   

359
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,490
Good morning!

360
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,260
   

361
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,810
Can I fax this?

362
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,520
Oh, yes.

363
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,510
 Why did Yun Seo go to the Teenager Department? 

364
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,400
She said she's always been interested in it.

365
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,190
I mean, Mother offered the executive office.

366
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,550
Why did she take over a smaller department?

367
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,560
 I want to learn the ropes one by one slowly. 

368
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,280
 That's why you started as a newbie, right? 

369
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,580
 That's true, but... 

370
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,720
 You're going to the foundation because you want to, right? 

371
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,810
 Of course. 

372
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,610
 When I saw Mr. Lee supporting young artists, 

373
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,250
 I thought of working pro-bono for a non-profit once I started my own business. 

374
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,600
 When Ji Seok and I first left home, 

375
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,100
 we couldn't get any support because we still legally had parents. 

376
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,440
 It was hard. 

377
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,130
 So... 

378
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,670
 try to understand me, okay? 

379
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,820
 There's nothing to understand. It all worked out. 

380
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,770
 I'm sorry about that time. 

381
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,700
 When I thought my sister was being disrespected, it pissed me off. 

382
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,540
 Ji Seok, the respect you get from others isn't that important. 

383
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,290
 Knowing my own worth is enough. 

384
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,340
 Wow. She's something. 

385
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,850
You two must be so busy right now. Is the wedding prep going okay?

386
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,880
Of course. As you saw in my room, we took the wedding photos.

387
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,520
I picked the venue, the champagne for the reception,

388
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,570
and the design for the bouquet.

389
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,970
Wait. What about her?

390
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,120
Yun Seo is busy,

391
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,320
but she said she'll be here today to look at the invitations.

392
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,490
I guess they're kind of unique.

393
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,470
Kind of?

394
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,050
Wow, I thought you looked up to me when you were drunk.

395
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,650
Where's all that respect?

396
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,610
I don't know about respect.

397
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,600
But I am thankful. You must be busy with the new exhibit prep.

398
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,770
I am, but I wanted to make sure I painted your invitations, so...

399
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,700
I went out of my way.

400
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,350
Yun Seo seems very busy these days. Can she come today?

401
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,060
Come on. Of course, she should come.

402
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,930
It's the invitation reveal day.

403
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,600
Are you on your way?

404
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,320
 I'm sorry. I don't think I can make it. 

405
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,070
I'm on my way home from a meeting.

406
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,720
I was going to drop off Deputy and then come,

407
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,080
but they need the scholarship award schedule right away.

408
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,450
Yes.

409
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,610
I'm sorry. I'll just have to see pictures of the invitations.

410
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,610
I'm getting a call. Bye!

411
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,120
 Yun Seo. Ha Yun Seo– 

412
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,830
Just talk to me. I know it's not ideal with just us two, but...

413
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,640
Yes, sure.

414
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,090
 But this was just the beginning. 

415
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,520
What do you mean, the meetings are backed up?

416
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,120
Yun Seo. Ha–

417
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,330
Should we reschedule for tomorrow?

418
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,950
We can't put this off anymore.

419
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,210
Then pick it out with me.

420
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,940
 I took care of the invitations with Lee Seong Min, 

421
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,910
 the furniture with Mi Jin, and... 

422
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,640
I feel strange living above newlyweds, but...

423
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,370
why can't my sister make it?

424
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,960
To get additional funding,

425
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,050
she has to go to headquarters.

426
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,990
 I had to look at our new home with Ji Seok. 

427
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,120
Hyeong, let's go.

428
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Are you okay?

429
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,370
- Should we go to the hospital? 
 - It's just a little sprain.

430
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,570
Can you hold me a little longer?

431
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,250
Wow. It's a really nice house. The tub is so big.

432
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,670
It'll be nice to wash up in there.

433
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,310
Right?

434
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,560
It's perfect for newlyweds.

435
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,350
That's AL Group's youngest son looking for his new home, right?

436
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,310
Yes.

437
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:01,940
Let's not fight anymore and live well happily, okay?

438
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,910
There were rumors that the Chairwoman was against it.

439
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,120
Was it because...

440
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,790
 The group had to stop unexpected rumors. 

441
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,030
 But even more challenging thing was... 

442
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,190
 that I missed Yun Seo. 

443
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,430
Is she really busy?

444
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,480
I'm not a petty guy who gets upset over this stuff.

445
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,890
 You can't make it today, either? 

446
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,710
Yes. I'm sorry.

447
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,020
I need to edit the scholarship recipient list.

448
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,960
 Do you have to finish that today? 

449
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,820
We were going to visit Uncle Jae Ha and Yi Rae.

450
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,190
Check to see if Ji Seok is doing well at his job.

451
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,580
Sorry. I'll reschedule the date with Yi Rae.

452
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,330
I'll call you when I'm done.

453
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,150
 ­  

454
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:01,720
What if my hubby cries his eyes out for joy when he sees these?

455
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,050
 ­  

456
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,300
Was it too much that I made these myself?

457
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,470
Come in.

458
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,730
They're from the Vice Chairman Seo Si Won.

459
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,140
Oh, my. So pretty.

460
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,290
Your necklace.

461
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,530
Wow, so pretty. It looks good on you.

462
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,390
When did you get it?

463
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,830
You don't know?

464
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,240
 She's cold. 

465
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,860
 It must be a necklace I should know about. 

466
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,760
Excuse me. Here's the cake you ordered.

467
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,400
We didn't order a cake.

468
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,020
- But you did. 
 - What?

469
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,580
The person who made the reservation call did.

470
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
   

471
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,000
Happy wedding day?

472
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,850
- Wifey... 
 - Tell Mr. Kim thanks for the cake.

473
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,800
- I... 
 - Thank him for the gift, too.

474
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,300
- I... I can... 
 - Done eating, right? Let's go.

475
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,550
Wifey! Mi Jin!

476
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,770
Wifey!

477
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,930
Mi Jin...

478
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,860
Let's go home separately.

479
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,470
S-Seperately?

480
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,130
Why?

481
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,780
I thought the gift and dinner were all your ideas.

482
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,290
I thought it was because of our wedding anniversary.

483
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,960
I'm sorry.

484
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,200
We've never celebrated it before, so...

485
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,530
Exactly! We haven't before, but now...

486
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,300
Now I like you, Hubby.

487
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,520
That's why I thought it would be different this time.

488
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm leaving.

489
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,330
Hey, Mi Jin...

490
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,870
   

491
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,810
   

492
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,720
   

493
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,610
Hello?

494
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,150
 It's not your honey, it's Uncle Jae Ha. 

495
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,450
Uncle? Why are you answering?

496
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,860
Is Ju Won there?

497
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,120
What? I said we should come together next time. Why did you come?

498
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,610
Well, Father-in-law was expecting us...

499
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,760
I mean,

500
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,220
Uncle Jae Ha made an off-menu chicken stew for us.

501
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,140
He boiled it for three hours with Ji Seok. How could I not come?

502
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,070
I'm sorry. You know what's going on with me these days.

503
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,720
I do. I know work is more important than me.

504
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,200
You know I'm busy with an important project!

505
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,970
I do.

506
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,630
Ha Yun Seo is so thorough that she has to take care of everything.

507
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,220
What's with your tone?

508
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,600
What's with your gaze?

509
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,430
- You want to fight?
- I've been holding back.

510
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,910
Holding back what?

511
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,420
This is too much.

512
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,430
How can you work so hard and half-ass the wedding prep?

513
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,290
What? Half-ass?

514
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,030
Yeah, half-ass.

515
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,760
I got the venue, I picked out the reception champagne,

516
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,110
and I even chose the bouquet design.

517
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,230
It'll be small with just family. All venues look the same.

518
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,800
I had you deal with champagne because you know it better.

519
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,620
Bouquets all look the same. What am I supposed to do?

520
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,390
S-Supposed to do?

521
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,450
Wow. Seriously?

522
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,670
I wasn't going to say this. But I picked out the invitations with Lee Seong Min,

523
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,130
the furniture with Mi Jin, and the house with Ji Seok!

524
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,720
I looked at the invitation via photos, the furniture via catalogs,

525
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,750
and we said we'll go back to the house next week.

526
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,060
What's the problem?

527
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,140
It's a huge problem! You should see with your eyes and touch with your hands!

528
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,690
I was so sad and lonely on my way home yesterday that I bought a plant!

529
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,910
What does a plant have to do with that?

530
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,580
Are you a T?* 
  (MBTI personality types) 

531
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,930
You two, the boss says stop fighting at her business premises and leave.

532
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,230
We're trying to run a business here.

533
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,570
That was so mean.

534
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,910
I'm working so hard because I don't want to embarrass him by doing a poor job.

535
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,320
   

536
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,820
I didn't get to thank her for picking out the furniture.

537
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,930
   

538
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,810
Do I call her or text her?

539
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,280
Oh, well.

540
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,620
It's late. Let's do it tomorrow.

541
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,950
 Hello? Yun Seo? 

542
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,650
 Hello? Yun Seo? 

543
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,740
 Yun Seo? 
   

544
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,070
What do I do?

545
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,670
Hello? Yun Seo?

546
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,900
Hello.

547
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,060
Is something the matter?

548
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,190
Well...

549
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,350
I'm sorry I didn't make it to shop for the furniture.

550
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,940
Oh, no need to feel bad for me.

551
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,720
I did my best to pick good ones. Enjoy. It's my wedding present.

552
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,690
No way! That's too much.

553
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,110
Then you can buy me a drink sometime.

554
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,780
-  A drink?  
 - Yes.

555
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,510
I want to be friends with you, Yun Seo.

556
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,450
I was going to ask you to a meal, but you seemed busy.

557
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,940
Are you still working?

558
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,600
 No, I'm on my way home. 

559
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,050
Can you get a drink now?

560
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,530
Right now?

561
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,060
Yes. I really need a drink right now.

562
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,770
Where are you? Let's meet.

563
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,560
I've been looking forward to having a drink with you,

564
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,090
and it's happening today!

565
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,840
I know.

566
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,500
Hello, Director.

567
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,660
I don't have a reservation. Is that okay? Is the room open?

568
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,530
Well, there's a long-standing reservation, so...

569
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,080
Let me find a way.

570
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm sorry, Yun Seo. I should have called ahead.

571
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,620
It's okay. I'm okay going anywhere.

572
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,730
But I didn't want you to be uncomfortable.

573
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,640
Can I take you to somewhere I know well?

574
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,870
Somewhere you know well?

575
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,380
Yes.

576
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,380
Here you go.

577
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,740
You want somaek as always, right?

578
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,790
Yes.

579
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,780
Enjoy. Let me know if you need anything else.

580
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,990
Okay.

581
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,200
Wow, this place seems amazing.

582
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,700
It tastes amazing, too.

583
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,170
Should we do cheers?

584
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,800
I must be crazy.

585
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,570
Forgetting our wedding anniversary...

586
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,000
I must be crazy!

587
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,250
 Hi, Hubby! 

588
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,540
 You know our anniversary is approaching, right? 

589
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,390
 It feels different this time. 

590
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,520
 Maybe because it's our first anniversary since I started liking you. 

591
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,750
So I prepared something.

592
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,230
 Ta-da! 

593
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,430
 It's a present! 

594
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,240
 Remember when we went to get makgeolli? 

595
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,890
 I'm making makgeolli glasses, remembering our time together. 

596
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,540
 Let's have a drink soon! 

597
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,820
 Congratulations on marrying me, Hubby. 

598
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,050
 You're so lucky. 

599
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,390
 Let me show you how I make it. 

600
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,770
I'm home.

601
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,250
You're still up?

602
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,920
The second trial is next week.

603
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,820
There's a lot on my mind,

604
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,830
so I was having a glass of wine.

605
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,420
How about you?

606
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,370
Are the wedding preparations going well?

607
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,420
Yes.

608
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,000
I knew Yun Seo would do well,

609
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,750
but she's gone above and beyond.

610
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,380
She visited every organization, had meetings

611
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,820
and selected scholarship recipients.

612
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,960
Apparently, there are many kids

613
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,450
whose parents are still alive but are being neglected.

614
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,850
That's why she's re-writing the recipient criteria.

615
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,730
   

616
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,300
 ­  

617
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,880
 ­  

618
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,590
I'm a crazy bastard.

619
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,330
I don't even deserve her love...

620
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,320
   

621
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,570
She must be really mad.

622
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,350
Damn it.

623
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,920
Is she crying somewhere?

624
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,830
 Cheers! 

625
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,260
That's crazy.

626
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,770
Director, you know how to drink.

627
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,730
"Director, Director."

628
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,100
Let's figure out what to call each other.

629
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,840
Then, Hyeongnim?

630
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,170
Hyeongnim? Sure.

631
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,750
Call me Hyeongnim.

632
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,400
Sister-in-law.

633
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,110
Yes, Hyeongnim.

634
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,680
Hyeongnim, did something bad happen today?

635
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,050
- Why? 
 - You said you really needed a drink.

636
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,070
I had a fight with Si Won today.

637
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,720
I had a fight with Ju Won today, too.

638
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,600
Really? Why?

639
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,690
He told me I'm half-assing the wedding prep!

640
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,730
It's so hard adjusting to my new job already.

641
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,550
Can't he take on a little more?

642
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:58,790
Right. If work is stressful, you can half-ass wedding prep.

643
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:01,100
I didn't think Ju Won was like that.

644
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,090
How petty.

645
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:07,210
I wouldn't say petty...

646
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,030
Why did you get into a fight, Hyeongnim?

647
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,660
Today's our anniversary, and Si Won forgot.

648
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,840
I got so excited about getting a gift, but it turns out his assistant sent it.

649
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,010
No way. He should have done it himself!

650
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,340
How inhumane.

651
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,800
I wouldn't say inhumane.

652
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,780
I think Mother might be the inhumane one.

653
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,190
How can she give you money to break up with Ju Won?

654
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,760
Look at you! You're talented, virtuous,

655
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,950
and make a mean somaek!

656
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,100
I know.

657
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,500
You know what? Let's go confront them.

658
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,600
- C-Confront them?
- Yes!

659
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,930
Whose fault is it that we're upset today?

660
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,010
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

661
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,450
Mother and her sons!

662
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:02,120
Let's go confront them about everything.

663
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,580
   

664
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,420
Hey, Hubby.

665
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,430
Me?

666
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,800
I'm drinking with Yun Seo. No, no need to come.

667
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,980
We're headed to Mother's place to confront her about stuff.

668
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,990
 What? 

669
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,280
Wifey, you're confronting my mother? What do you mean?

670
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,800
Wifey? M-Mi Jin? Mi Jin!

671
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,380
This is bad.

672
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,650
This is so bad.

673
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,760
Hey, Ju Won. Emergency.

674
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,780
Yun Seo and Mi Jin are headed home to confront Mother.

675
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,530
Wait outside until they–

676
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,830
What? You're not home?

677
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,900
You're not home?

678
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,930
I'm on the way to Yun Seo's.

679
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,820
Okay, got it. I'll head home now.

680
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,400
Mr. Kim, I have a sister-in-law now.

681
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,750
Somaek!

682
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,920
Let's go! Let's go, I said!

683
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,410
Could you go a little faster?

684
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,790
Let's go! Step on it!

685
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,810
Can we do this?

686
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,180
Sister-in-law!

687
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,530
Fighting!

688
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,570
Wait, wait, wait.

689
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,020
Over there, there.

690
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,050
Mother!

691
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,070
Mother!

692
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,680
Mother, come outside!

693
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,930
Boom, boom, boom!

694
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,000
Let go!

695
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,730
- Let go! 
 - Mother!

696
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,880
What?

697
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,010
What happened?

698
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,320
I was with the director...

699
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,420
 No, 

700
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,800
 Hyeongnim and I drank... 

701
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,050
 We went to the chairwoman's to confront her, 

702
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,810
and Ju Won came...

703
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,380
I must have lost my mind!

704
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,130
How could I go there? I must be crazy...

705
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,630
   

706
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,770
What do I say to apologize?

707
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,060
   

708
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,360
 Yun Seo. How are you feeling? 

709
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,370
 I'm sorry about last night. 

710
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,380
 If you're upset, it's all my fault. 

711
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,500
 Call me when you're not mad anymore. 

712
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,570
She read it. Why isn't she responding?

713
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,870
 I'm hungover. Get me some medicine. 

714
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,270
Should I have brought some soup?

715
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:28,820
What? Why didn't she close the door?

716
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,470
Oh, hey.

717
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,100
Hey.

718
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,290
The door was open.

719
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:13,330
I was making some fish, and it smelled.

720
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:16,920
What's up all of a sudden?

721
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,210
I just...

722
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,940
wanted to say sorry.

723
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,650
About making you do the wedding prep alone...

724
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,820
and causing a scene last night.

725
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,470
So I prepared something.

726
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,980
Wow, it looks amazing.

727
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,170
I've been craving soybean soup since last night.

728
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,810
It's a stew.

729
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,470
I haven't made it in a while, so I messed up the portions.

730
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:00,160
You sure think big. Love it, love it.

731
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,320
Honey, the rice is so good. Perfectly cooked.

732
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,400
It's microwavable rice.

733
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,230
- The side dishes are so good.
- Ji Seok made them.

734
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,800
I just made the stew.

735
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,990
Right.

736
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,130
It's too salty, right? I'll add more water.

737
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:42,410
No. It's perfect.

738
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,460
Just a little more water.

739
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,780
It's so good.

740
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,310
Really?

741
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:50,690
Then, just a little.

742
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,900
It wasn't too horrible, right?

743
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,090
Of course not. It was good. The best!

744
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,350
But I can't promise you I'll make it often.

745
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,030
Okay. Thanks.

746
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,830
I mean...

747
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,810
That's too bad.

748
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,350
I'm not a passive guy who just eats what you make for me.

749
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:27,550
So just do what you love and what you're good at.

750
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,280
Right, I wanted to show you.

751
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,470
Our invitation.

752
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,810
I asked Mr. Lee to make them fast.

753
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,810
This makes our wedding feel real, right?

754
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,220
Yes.

755
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,340
I feel a little strange.

756
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:57,820
♫  You smile at me  ♫

757
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,720
I love you.

758
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,950
So suddenly?

759
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,990
Not so suddenly.

760
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,200
I love you always.

761
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,670
Me, too.

762
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,920
I love you, too.

763
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:20,270
♫  I'll become your ground  ♫

764
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:29,320
♫  I'll become solid, if you don't mind  ♫

765
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,520
Wedding invitations?

766
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,910
I still can't believe...

767
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,720
that those two are getting married in a few days.

768
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,060
I know.

769
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,740
But Team Leader Ha will be happy, right?

770
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,290
I mean, a chaebol family is intense. What if she's bullied?

771
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,240
It's a terrible table manner!

772
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,770
Not in the same league. Can't eat with you.

773
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,880
Should we eat the dessert by ourselves?

774
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,910
I think it'd be a waste.

775
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,190
Oh, my God!

776
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,730
Come clean this now!

777
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,900
No, no. Not that!

778
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,580
 This! 

779
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,100
M-Me?

780
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,240
W-Wait! Can I take this with me?

781
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,910
Mother! I've never had lobster before!

782
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,120
Mother!

783
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,390
- Please stop. 
 - Yes.

784
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,930
Team Leader Bae, you've seen too many dramas.

785
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,640
R-Right.

786
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,210
I will get rid of my TV immediately.

787
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,540
- Should we do cheers? 
 - Yes!

788
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,050
- One, two, three, cheers! 
  - Cheers! 

789
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,840
Congratulations!

790
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:47,600
 Of course, the fairytale I'm about to write might turn out to be a crazy drama. 

791
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,400
Oh, my, my, my.

792
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,900
What's wrong with you?

793
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:57,100
 Like in many fairytales, the ending, "They lived happily ever after," 

794
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,310
 doesn't happen in real life. 

795
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,260
Cheers?

796
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,150
These glasses are so pretty.

797
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:16,070
I feel like the drinks go down smoother because you made them.

798
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,140
Right? You're grateful, right?

799
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,250
Make sure you remember our next anniversary.

800
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,880
I am really sorry about that.

801
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,660
I actually thought the day we started dating was more important than our wedding.

802
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,160
I was preparing a gift for our 100-day anniversary.

803
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,600
Are you making that up because you feel bad?

804
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,460
No, no. For real.

805
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,590
I knew you would say that.

806
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,420
So I prepared something.

807
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,930
What is it?

808
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,240
Here.

809
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,960
Interior design. On our 100th day, let's share a bedroom.

810
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,800
One hundred days?

811
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,480
Let's just share starting today.

812
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,050
- Mi Jin. 
 - Yes?

813
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,690
I love you.

814
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,250
Me, too.

815
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:22,250
 But even still, 

816
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:26,850
 I'm going to try to believe in eternal love. 

817
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,490
Ji Seok, shopping is the start of cooking. Got it?

818
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,520
I'm a regular here. Look at this.

819
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,910
This one.

820
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,980
- It's a live octopus.
- Stop it. That's crazy!

821
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,500
Uncle!

822
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,700
 When little moments of happiness pile up day after day... 

823
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,560

♫  I can always feel you approaching me  ♫

825
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,000
 Perhaps reality could be. 

826
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,700
 even lovelier than a fairytale.

 Cinderella at 2 a.m. said this. 

834
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:52,300
 2 a.m. isn't a painful time. 

835
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,340
 It could be an exciting time. 

836
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:02,100
 Jumping in without expecting pain is arrogance and ignorance, 

837
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:08,100
 but stepping forward, knowing you might suffer, is courage.

♫  Don't go alone  ♫

♫  Fading you, like a fog  ♫

848

♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

849
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:44,490
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

850

♫  The time will hold onto us, you know  ♫

853
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,810
 I have my loved ones near me, 

854
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,230
 and I have enough courage. 

855
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,900
 The end of this story has to be a happy ending.
