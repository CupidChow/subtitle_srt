1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,460
   

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,550
   

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,370
   

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,970
   

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,330
   

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:34,860


7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,050
   

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,900
I thought you wanted a pat on your back.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,180
I mean...

10
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,220
Thanks for coming all the way here to wrap things up.

11
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,580
Today must have been tough for you.

12
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,680
We handled it well. Thanks to the assemblyman's article,

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,920
I don't think there will be more speculation so don't worry.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,540
I have a meeting regarding the hanok stay so I should go.

15
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,790
Travel back safely. Great job today.

16
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,150
Why is he just leaving?

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,230
I know.

18
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,870
What do you mean why? What else would he do?

19
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,770
You know.

20
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,330
Just last night, he was one-upping me like some kind of kid.

21
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,230
He just saw us like this.

22
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,870
Like what? What did we do?

23
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,120
We drew some pictures and consoled each other.

24
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,730
I know!

25
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,650
We sat side-by-side drawing, and you patted me on the back, comforting me.

26
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,910
He's the king of jealousy. Isn't it weird that he just left?

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,110
That's not strange to you?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,100
 Director, I'm on my way to Yeosu. 
   

29
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,360
 If reporters swarm the place, someone should be there. 

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,080
What is it? What's wrong?

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,620
Yun Seo is on her way to Yeosu.

32
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,130
I know it's for work, but it bothers me.

33
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,700
I got a helicopter for you last night. You didn't get her back?

34
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,210
Get her? I got swept up in my feelings and got drunk.

35
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,940
I got wasted in front of Yun Seo and Lee Seong Min and acted up.

36
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,510
I can't stand this. I need to go there, too.

37
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,550
Hey.

38
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,210
What? I'm busy. Why are you getting in my way?

39
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,560
Mother is in distress, and I'm busy with work and personal life.

40
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,600
I wasn't going to butt into your love life anymore, but this...

41
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,450
I can't just watch this happen.

42
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,400
So what? Will you step in again? No thanks.

43
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,550
I got on a helicopter because of you and totally failed.

44
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,950
Hey, I told you to get Yun Seo back, not get wasted.

45
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,320
Be honest. You ran over last night and told her you were jealous,

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,640
that you wanted her back. You told her everything. Right?

47
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,880
- How did you know? 
 - Hey, bro, you're nothing but a beanpole.

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,640
Who plays cards with an open deck?

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,070
If you show her how you feel, you've already lost that game.

50
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,570
Now, you need a different strategy.

51
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,320
- A different strategy? 
 - Yes.

52
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,660
If you really want her back...

53
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,570
let her go now and get her later.

54
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,100
This tactic is called "one step back, ten steps forward."

55
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,780
If I really want her back, I'll let her go, then get her back.

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,800
   

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,240
What's wrong?

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
Does it feel weird that Seo Ju Won just left?

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
N-No.

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,270
I'm just hungry so I was thinking about what I'll eat at home.

61
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,430
I think black bean noodles or tteokbokki sounds good.

62
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:17,520
What happened today was challenging because politics got involved.

63
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,730
It's weirder to mix personal feelings into it.

64
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,730
I think he seems to know how to separate work and private life.

65
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,940
It made me think of Seo Ju Won differently.

66
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,650
But he doesn't seem like he'd just let it go.

67
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,980
I'm already tired, thinking about how he'll come at me tomorrow.

68
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,040
So do you want to have noodles and tteokbokki with me?

69
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,730
Why would I have that with you?

70
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,880
No thanks.

71
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,690
Why not?

72
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,080
Are you worried the director will find out?

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,430
Wh-What? Who's worried about that?

74
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,960
 I was worried. I was bothered. 

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,540
 The next day, Ju Won was more different than I expected. 

76
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,630
Good morning.

77
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,320
Hi. Good morn... I mean, morning.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,930
Actually, it's a bit of a challenging morning.

79
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,670
What's wrong? Did something happen?

80
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,820
The director is moving his office.

81
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,330
What?

82
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,390
Director, why are you moving your office all of a sudden?

83
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,090
I have a lot of meetings with Marketing Team 3 coming up.

84
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,730
Are you coming back?

85
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,050
I don't know.

86
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,300
I'm not sure when.

87
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,570
Okay, then.

88
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:00,300
 The first thing you need to do is move your office. 

89
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,650
My office? Why?

90
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,790
Why? You have never been out of Yun Seo's sight.

91
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,600
You don't notice someone who's there, but you do notice when they're gone.

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,980
If she expected you by her side at all times, then doesn't see you...

93
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,800
she'll think of you more.

94
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,640
But there's also a saying, "out of sight, out of mind."

95
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,510
What if she couldn't help but think of me when I was there but feels great when I'm gone?

96
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,510
Stop that.

97
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,530
Don't waste your time being so frustrating.

98
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,220
Pack up right now.

99
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,220
The director is really trying to get over her, right?

100
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,470
I guess so.

101
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,420
At the Team Leader's house, and at the staff dinner...

102
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,760
He still seemed to have intense feelings for her.

103
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,700
But if he's packed up and gone, I think it's really over. Over!

104
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,400
- Right? 
 - Let's go.

105
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,120
 He still showed up to the meeting. I didn't think he would. 

106
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,900
Thanks for the report.

107
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,480
When we signed on Lee Seong Min,

108
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,420
one of the terms was to support young artists' projects.

109
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,050
I think it's a good cause I'd like to pursue.

110
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,520
What do you think, Team Leader?

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,430
Yes, I think it'd be good.

112
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,510
I think it'd help our brand image as well.

113
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,930
How about making an artist's residence at the hanok stay?

114
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,990
I don't like it.

115
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,730
 From now on, you're a bad guy. 

116
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,200
 A bad guy? What is that? 

117
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,000
 Gosh, my mouth hurts from having to explain all this. 

118
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,630
 As if you're the best person in the world, 

119
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,650
 you've been nothing but tender, sweet, and polite to Yun Seo, right? 

120
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,580
 Of course. I care about her. 

121
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,320
 But... 

122
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,870
 women might badmouth bad guys, but they love them. 

123
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,950
 A guy who makes her anxious with desire. 

124
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,980
 Look. 

125
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,200
 You keep clinging to me because I'm rude to you, right? 

126
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,020
 Were you anxious or not? 

127
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,340
 - I was. 
 - Exactly. 

128
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,620
 Why does it have to be just you? Make her want it, too. 

129
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,880
 Until now, every time, you've been... 

130
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,760
 "Okay. Got it." From now on, 

131
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,630
 say "no." "I don't know." And be particular! 

132
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:57,320
 If you turn into a jerk, she'll be antsy and want you more, trying to change your mind. 

133
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,200
Then what about supporting them in the form of scholarships?

134
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,730
Maybe three artists...

135
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,020
Four would be better, no?

136
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,060
Sure.

137
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,490
Then let's make it four.

138
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,810
As for funding, the amount that allows them to stay abroad for about a year–

139
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,450
A year and a half would be better.

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,260
How about we order food before we continue?

141
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,840
Good idea. Team Leader, what would you like to eat?

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Let's just have some kimbap.

143
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,650
I don't know.

144
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,280
Tuna kimbap would be better.

145
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,920
What is this all of a sudden?

146
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,780
Just a few days ago, he said he couldn't live without me.

147
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,060
Why is Seo Ju Won being like this all of a sudden?

148
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,640
Right.

149
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,840
Did you do something to turn him off?

150
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,740
What could I have done? Even so...

151
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,070
it hasn't even been three days. What could I have done?

152
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,390
Hey. That one time.

153
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,080
When you came asking for hangover soup after drinking all night.

154
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,730
You said you got wasted with Ju Won and made a mistake.

155
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,630
Did you make a spectacle of yourself then?

156
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,970
 Is that why you can't forget me? 

157
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,480
 Because I'm so pretty? 

158
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,580
As if he wasn't drunk himself? He was even more drunk than me!

159
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,960
That's right. It couldn't have been his first time seeing Yun Seo drunk.

160
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,520
I think it's something else.

161
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,790
Something else? What?

162
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,690
I overheard in the kitchen that

163
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,330
you've been friendly with another guy lately.

164
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,970
You said Ju Won wasn't happy about it.

165
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,700
Despite that, you weren't cautious. Perhaps he's disappointed?

166
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,490
The certainty that you were the one to spend his life with disappeared.

167
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,300
That's possible.

168
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,550
If you did that when he said he didn't like it,

169
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,310
it could've come across as inconsiderate.

170
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,190
Whatever.

171
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,240
He can think of me as inconsiderate or whatnot.

172
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,780
It's a good thing. We're broken up. We should have distance.

173
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,910
What's the big deal?

174
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,310
 Hyeong, I'm scared. 

175
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,220
Yun Seo seemed angry in the meeting yesterday.

176
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,910
I think I need to stop.

177
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,640
Get it together!

178
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,550
Go wash your face in cold water.

179
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,370
You're about to throw the final punch.

180
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,170
- The final punch? 
 - Yes.

181
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,940
- What is that? 
 - Come over here.

182
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,310
It's...

183
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,090
called the "Jealousy Operation."

184
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,690
- Jealousy Operation? 
 - Yes.

185
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,960
When another guy pursued Yun Seo, it set you on fire, right?

186
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,060
Yes.

187
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,970
Put yourself in her shoes.

188
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,630
That jealousy you feel. That primal feeling.

189
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,970
Yun Seo has to feel it to know how precious you are.

190
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,680
Call a female friend and hang out with her where Yun Seo frequents.

191
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,170
I don't know any girls besides Yun Seo.

192
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,530
How can you be Gen Z and not have a female friend?

193
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,220
Then go on a blind date.

194
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,930
No way. That's not playing hard to get. That's cheating.

195
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,610
That's not cheating. It's the Jealousy Operation, I said!

196
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,700
Aigoo, seriously...

197
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,070
   

198
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,890
Hold on.

199
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,750
Yes.

200
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm at the office.

201
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 Really? Have fun working. See you later. 

202
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,070
Later? She's in Paris.

203
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,410
Hey, Ju Won!

204
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,820
Find someone! The Jealousy Operation really works!

205
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,160
Jealousy? No thanks.

206
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,820
 The canceled artist event is rescheduled for next week. 

207
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
 Just letting you know. 

208
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,230
 Anyway, jealous Seo Ju Won is back to normal, right? 

209
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,010
Back to normal? No.

210
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,070
I should be thankful that he's finally over me.

211
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,130
It's a good thing.

212
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,310
What?

213
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,750
Hey, is that the director's girlfriend?

214
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
No, it's the vice chairman's wife.

215
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,500
Executive Director of Eunoh Department Store.

216
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,660
Oh, right. I've seen her on social media.

217
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,430
 I remember Executive Director Lee Mi Jin. 

218
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,800
 I was so taken aback that I didn't recognize her. 

219
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,310
 It was a quick misunderstanding, but it will actually happen someday. 

220
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,470
 I really did want him to meet someone great. 

221
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,980
 But I was still shocked that 

222
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,900
 merely seeing someone else by Ju Won's side 

223
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,100
 took me by surprise, more than I thought it would. 

224
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,580
Sister-in-law, you can let go now.

225
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,490
Should I?

226
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm wearing high heels so I was holding onto you for support.

227
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,930
I'm sorry if you were uncomfortable.

228
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,370
More than that, the employees are watching.

229
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,550
They know I'm your sister-in-law, though.

230
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,660
Wait.

231
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,430
Is there someone here you're self-conscious of?

232
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,080
Ju Won, are you dating someone at work?

233
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,880
Is that why you left home?

234
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,910
I know it's a secret that you're here. I won't tell Hyeong about meeting you.

235
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,400
Go ahead.

236
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,190
Okay.

237
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,930
  ­ 

238
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,070
Why did she call me?

239
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,400
She's in Paris. But "See you later"?

240
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,790
She talks so strangely.

241
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,930
She was posting everything she ate in Paris.

242
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,680
What did she eat today?

243
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,500
Oh?

244
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,840
She hasn't posted anything today.

245
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,890
She ate bread yesterday and macarons the day before.

246
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,360
What is this?

247
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,070
I never pressed this.

248
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,990
Aigoo! I love this.

249
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,800
So comfortable.

250
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,080
   

251
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,870
Is she there to work or to eat?

252
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,090
This looks good. Where is this?

253
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,060
I don't know.

254
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,590
Is someone there?

255
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,100
Geez, when did I press this?

256
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,170
She didn't see it, right?

257
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,950
I mean, she has more than 10,000 likes.

258
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,610
Even if she has, she can't know that it's me.

259
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,950
I only have a burner account with no posts so I can lurk.

260
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,800
Don't worry, Si Won.

261
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,860
Husband?

262
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,760
Hi.

263
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,460
Wait...

264
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,130
I thought you were in France. Why are you here...

265
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,130
I told you earlier. "See you later."

266
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,870
Work ended a little early.

267
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,300
Was that what you meant?

268
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,730
But why did you come here instead of home?

269
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,300
To give you this as soon as possible.

270
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,830
What is this?

271
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,590
You must have wanted them badly if you "liked" my photo.

272
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,800
L-Liked what? What are you talking about?

273
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,500
Did you think I didn't know that you look at my social media?

274
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,950
What social media?

275
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,140
I once posted something at home and heard your notification.

276
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,320
Your ID is so obvious. I memorized it in one go.

277
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,940
- Stop. 
 - Westcool.

278
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,290
Stop it.

279
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,170
Seo*... 
  (*Seo means "West" in Korean) 

280
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,470
Si Won.

281
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,790
 (Siwon means "Cool" in Korean) 

282
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,380
From now on, if you want to know what I'm doing, just ask.

283
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,110
If you want to eat anything, ask me to bring you some.

284
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,410
Okay. I will.

285
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,820
What are you doing? Try it. They're really good.

286
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,550
Okay.

287
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,330
Thank you. I'll enjoy them.

288
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,300
Okay.

289
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,740
The natural light in here is nice. It'll be great for photos.

290
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,070
Ta-da!

291
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,760
Delicious!

292
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,810
- Does it pass? 
 - Absolutely.

293
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,200
- Uncle. 
 - Yes.

294
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,650
Then...

295
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,720
Let's launch the clam stew on the 15th. Done?

296
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,330
- Done! 
 - Good.

297
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,090
Hey, what is that?

298
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,980
What's going on that day?

299
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,470
- It's Yun Seo's birthday. 
 - Oh?

300
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,540
Yun Seo's birthday? Hey! Tell her to come over.

301
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,540
I'll make seaweed soup and japchae.

302
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,430
It's fine. She doesn't like it when others celebrate her birthday.

303
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,950
Who does that?

304
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,780
She does. I gave her a gift once, and she didn't accept it.

305
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,720
But that's what people do to care for each other.

306
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,500
But when I think about it...

307
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,290
Yun Seo never worries about you.

308
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,870
Why are you always worried about Yun Seo?

309
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,340
Did you give birth to her? Why are you so good to her?

310
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,720
Her own parents weren't good to her.

311
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,220
What does that make me?

312
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,970
Anyway...

313
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,500
Never mind being happy,

314
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,700
I just hope nothing comes up that day...

315
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,700
Ha Yun Seo.

316
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,820
   

317
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,540
Working hard first thing in the morning.

318
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,440
 Nuna, it's my turn to clean at school, so I'm leaving early. 

319
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,550
 Eat before you go to work. 

320
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,420
 Happy birthday. 

321
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,200
What is it? It's early.

322
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,810
What else? I wanted to be the first one to wish you a happy birthday.

323
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,980
Let's share this and go to work.

324
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,740
I got a bento perfect for sharing.

325
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,340
I told you not to do anything for my birthday.

326
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,060
Come on.

327
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,610
You shouldn't have.

328
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm going to.

329
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,600
To finish...

330
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,890
You didn't make a heart with peas or something, right?

331
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
♫  You're a small boat floating in the sea  ♫

332
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,180
You're so mean.

333
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,670
I'm sorry.

334
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,500
I even burned my hand boiling these peas.

335
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,670
How can you do this to me?

336
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,260
Are you okay? Let me see.

337
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,380
Are you hurt anywhere else? So why did you–

338
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:31,720
♫  The compass in my hand spins around and around  ♫

339
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,700
♫  You're my only one shining star  ♫

340
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,920
Coffee's here.

341
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,550
All right, Ju Won!

342
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,430
- Here's yours, Deputy Bae. 
 - Thank you.

343
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,670
- Two sleeves? 
 - Two.

344
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,170
Team Leader.

345
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,450
Thank you.

346
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,040
 Today is Ha Yun Seo Day. You do whatever you want to do today. 

347
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,930
   

348
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Are you crazy? I told you not to be obvious at work.

349
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,240
If you do that one more time...

350
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,890
I get it. I'm sorry. Instead,

351
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,680
I'll give you the egg.

352
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,970
Fine. If you're giving me your egg, I forgive you.

353
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,460
But why tteokbokki? I wanted to take you to somewhere nicer.

354
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,900
You said I can do whatever I want today.

355
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,030
I wanted the tteokbokki from here today.

356
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,120
Sir, here's your order.

357
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,870
Did you order something else? Good job–

358
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,320
What is this?

359
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,280
Actually, I wanted to do this somewhere more romantic,

360
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,380
but we came here, so...

361
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,950
It doesn't go with the vibe here, but...

362
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,880
please take it.

363
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,300
Thank goodness no one's going to go overboard this year.

364
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,520
No way...

365
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,540
- Coffee's here! 
 - Coffee?

367
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,760
I ran into the director at the cafe. It's his treat!

368
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,300
Deputy Bae, a latte for you.

369
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,730
Team Leader, an Americano for you.

370
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,160
And a cappuccino for me!

371
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,590
Enjoy! 
    

372
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,320
 Have the happiest day. 

373
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,980
A day as full as the foam on this cappuccino!

374
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,170
Thank you! Come again!

375
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,110
What is this? Who wrote this?

376
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,390
The barista. He was so sweet.

377
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,260
I got a cookie on the house, too!

378
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,840
Why are you here looking so down?

379
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,060
Is it hard playing hard to get?

380
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,470
Ju Won.

381
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,340
If you get over this hump, you can get Yun Seo back.

382
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,690
So be strong.

383
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,230
Still.

384
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,380
It's hard to hold it in today.

385
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,700
I wanted to make her happier this birthday.

386
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,230
Her birthday? Are you crazy?

387
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,790
It's her birthday, and you're sitting here doing nothing?

388
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,270
You said let her go, then get her back–

389
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,060
You punk! Should I hold you by the neck?

390
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,380
You still need to do something on her birthday!

391
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,220
If you don't take care of this, you'll never get her back.

392
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,340
Okay.

393
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,530
We've let her go until now, so let's get her back today. It's D-Day.

394
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:57,740
Let's get her back.

395
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,130
- D-Day? 
- Yes.

396
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,940
First, make a reservation at the best restaurant you know.

397
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,650
Rent out the whole place.

398
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,450
Yun Seo hates it when people flaunt money.

399
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,790
- Really? 
 - Yes.

400
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,510
Then what does she like?

401
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,400
Super spicy tteokbokki?

402
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,440
This is super hopeless.

403
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,450
Hey. Get a reservation at the hottest place in Seoul,

404
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,240
and prepare something small and shiny.

405
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,550
Like a ring–

406
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,020
I got that.

407
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,310
Look at you.

408
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,870
 Are you really going to be like this? 

409
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,240
I wanted to do something nice for my girlfriend's birthday.

410
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,620
Why are you giving it back?

411
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,770
Can't you just accept it?

412
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,420
It's just that...

413
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,490
it feels awkward for me to celebrate my birthday.

414
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,250
Every family has their own thing, right?

415
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,000
My family didn't care for birthdays or celebrate them.

416
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,890
It wasn't like that.

417
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:19,410
So, when I hear "Happy birthday," I'm not sure what to say.

418
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,240
I don't know if it's something to celebrate.

419
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,380
What are you doing?

420
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,250
♫  If you were I, what would you do?  ♫

421
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,660
This is the most special day out of

422
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,960
the 365 days of the year.

423
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,300
Thank you for being born.

424
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,000
♫  Countless distance between us  ♫

425
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,300
 That was the first time I had heard something like that. 

426
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,440
 Maybe that one memory kept me anticipating... 

427
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,300
 that something good might happen. 

428
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,480
 Anticipating, being jealous, my heart feeling down... 

429
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,620
 I felt his absence more than I thought I would. 

430
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,230
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

431
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,860
Hello.

432
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,350
 I'm calling from Jisan Hospital. 

433
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,610
Yes? What's going on?

434
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,700
 Can we meet today? 
   

435
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,410
Let's set clear goals

436
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,350
and expectations for the marketing performance report.

437
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,950
For instance, "increase sales."

438
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,190
This is how we can set a goal to increase. 
    

439
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,230
As for the cost per customer, through marketing efforts...

440
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,490
Aigoo, Director!

441
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,350
Long time no see! We missed you!

442
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,520
Yes.

443
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,130
Team Leader went home early today.

444
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,790
Did something happen?

445
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:52,020
I don't know. But she did seem quite out of it when she left.

446
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,620
 What happened? 

447
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,270
 Did I act foolishly out of selfishness? 

448
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,580
 Even so, she's not the type to react so emotionally. 

449
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,400
Have a good night. Bye now.

450
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,310
I'm so embarrassed every time I see her.

451
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:33,080
 Did you think I didn't know that you look at my social media? 

452
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,000
 I once posted something at home and heard your notification. 

453
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,420
Does she think I'm some kind of pervert who creeps on her?

454
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,040
This damn notification!

455
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,110
Hey!

456
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,210
You make me want to look. She caught me lurking because of you!

457
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,470
I can't deal with you anymore. I'm punishing you.

458
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:56,350
I'm turning you off.

459
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,530
Hey.

460
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:16,570
Have you had dinner?

461
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,930
What is this?

462
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,620
You promised not to post my picture on social media.

463
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,920
I know, but people are saying our marriage is for show again.

464
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,210
I thought they'd talk about divorce–

465
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,230
Then you should have told me!

466
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,040
She came to my office with macarons for the picture.

467
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,370
She wanted a setup to quiet the rumors.

468
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,910
I thought it was for me.

469
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,650
People are going to tear me apart again.

470
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,080
Like the time I posted a crying selfie.

471
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,110
   

472
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,460
   

473
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,710
What is this reaction?

474
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,640
   

475
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,470
   

476
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,450
   

477
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:01,540
I make people feel jealous?

478
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,130
I've committed a great sin.

479
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,000
Let's atone, Si Won.

480
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,100
What's this?

481
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,960
Why is everyone calling me cute?

482
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm the charismatic type.

483
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,850
A guy like me...

484
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,860
"The definition of looking cute together."

485
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,070
Sounds good.

486
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,030
Capture. 
    

487
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,180
What?

488
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,840
Wh-Where did it go?

489
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,480
What?

490
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,130
Hey...

491
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,260
I'm sorry.

492
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,590
I didn't know you'd hate it that much.

493
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,170
I deleted it so don't worry. Good night.

494
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,230
Oh, w-wait...

495
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,520
I didn't get to read the new comments.

496
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,920
The picture disappeared so suddenly.

497
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,420
People must be so disappointed.

498
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,130
Can I have a glass?

499
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,480
If I knew you'd screenshot them, I wouldn't have deleted it.

500
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,350
Well...

501
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,040
I've never had people react to me like this.

502
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,930
It's strange, so I...

503
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,650
Should we take one together and re-post it?

504
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,240
Gosh, no way. What are you saying...

505
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,160
Really?

506
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,420
Okay, then.

507
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,830
I think I'll have some wine.

508
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,290
Today...

509
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,280
I'm going to post this one.

510
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,010
Aigoo. You're in it.

511
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,930
I did it because you looked cute.

512
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,840
What?

513
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,290
The marriage for show thing was an excuse.

514
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,270
I posted that photo because you looked cute.

515
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,920
R-Really?

516
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,430
I... I'm sorry I overreacted, too.

517
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,130
I was touched that you came to give me macarons.

518
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,370
When I thought you came just for the photo, I was disappointed.

519
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,160
I see.

520
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,260
Then can I start posting pictures of you? Sometimes?

521
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,090
Gosh, we're married.

522
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,120
If my wife is asking, I can't protest too much.

523
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,760
I respect you.

524
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,280
Then you want to take a picture together?

525
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,380
Well, if you want.

526
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,770
♫  I picture you smiling  ♫

527
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,130
♫  Everyone I meet every day  ♫

528
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,150
♫  You help me deal with it  ♫

529
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,320
Two, three!

530
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,680
You're good.

531
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,380
I've never done this.

532
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,050
♫  Those days where you used to tilt your head  ♫

533
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,440
♫  At the end of this truthful moment  ♫

534
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,870
♫  We're here together today  ♫

535
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,130
We look like a real married couple in this.

536
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,600
We look good together, too.

537
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,670
♫  I can't help but smile  ♫

538
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,090
♫  Wait a moment, wait for me  ♫

539
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,410
   

540
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,760
♫  Just gonna be alright  ♫

541
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,850
This husband keeps being cute.

542
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,900
So cute.

543
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,890
♫  I will do the same  ♫

544
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,340
♫  I'll always feel it  ♫

545
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,740
♫  You, who came to me  ♫

546
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,200
   

547
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,890
 I'm calling from Jisan Hospital. 

548
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,970
Yes.

549
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,900
The hospital?

550
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,500
 Are you Ha Yun Seo, Patient Kim Hui Suk's daughter? 

551
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,850
 I need to discuss your mother's funeral process with you. 

552
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,360
 Kim Hui Suk has been with us for three years for kidney failure. 

553
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,220
 She passed away yesterday. 

554
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,230
 The last time I saw my mother, I was a senior in college. 

555
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,220
   

556
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,600
 I got a call saying my father was dead. 

557
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,580
 He was drunk driving 

558
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,990
 and was being sued by the victim. 

559
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,650
 Then he drove drunk again and died instantly. 

560
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,740
 It was a death befitting for that man. 

561
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,580
 And to clean up that man's mistake, 

562
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,400
 I saw a face I didn't want to see ever again in my life. 

563
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,080
 This person, called mom, 

564
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,260
 turned a blind eye whenever I was beaten up. 

565
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,570
Is it good?

566
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,280
 Why? Why? Why? 

567
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,510
 I can't even run away because of you two! 

568
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,820
 This is how I'm living! 

569
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,080
 Why! 

570
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,710
It's okay.

571
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,080
 She drank like my father 

572
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,180
 and sobbed like a monster. 

573
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,930
Let's see...

574
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,110
Damn it...

575
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,500
Hey. You annoying little brat.

576
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,700
Take this little bastard and disappear from my life.

577
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,990
Disappear!

578
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,090
Just disappear!

579
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,120
Why...

580
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,120
did you want to see me?

581
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,230
He's still your father.

582
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,500
You should pay your respects one last time.

583
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,410
That's a child's duty.

584
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,240
Aren't you graduating soon?

585
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,940
You'll get a job then.

586
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,500
You'll need to pay back your father's debt.

587
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,110
Stop wandering and come back. You can't cut ties with your bloodline.

588
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,830
My bloodline?

589
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,950
If the connection between parent and child

590
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:54,760
is god-given,

591
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,900
I'll take the punishment.

592
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,600
My family is Ji Seok.

593
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,330
Only Ji Seok.

594
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,270
That's right.

595
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,980
Say whatever you want.

596
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,420
So how do you feel?

597
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,650
I don't know.

598
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,080
After I left home, I struggled so much.

599
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,270
Maybe because of that,

600
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,040
I know I'll be punished for this, but...

601
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,730
I'm not sad at all.

602
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,220
I'm not going to his funeral.

603
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,250
I'm never going to

604
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,410
pick up my mom's calls again.

605
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,120
Why today?

606
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,890
Stop drinking.

607
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,990
You might pass out.

608
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,030
Why are you here?

609
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,180
I was meeting with the marketing team

610
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,720
and saw a woman looking sad sitting by the window.

611
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,980
A bottle of soju and a glass, please.

612
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,030
 Sure. 

613
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,900
What's going on?

614
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,320
They say she's dead.

615
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,310
What?

616
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:11,060
She should've been better to her children.

617
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,900
I never asked for much.

618
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,890
I just...

619
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,980
wanted her to say one thing.

620
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,840
"I'm sorry."

621
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,370
Is that so hard to say?

622
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,440
Are you crying?

623
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,250
No.

624
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,950
I have no tears to cry

625
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,370
for someone like that.

626
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,460
 Yun Seo. 

627
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,270
 Did something happen? 

628
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,110
 I'm worried. Please respond. 

629
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,590
Why am I such a fool every single time?

630
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,420
I wanted to live with no regrets.

631
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,240
I clenched my teeth and survived until now.

632
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,420
Someone I hated is dead, and it shook me up.

633
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,810
Actually...

634
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,980
when I heard about your father,

635
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,050
I was surprised.

636
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,760
I went through the same thing.

637
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,700
My father was violent, and my mother was a bystander.

638
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:56,500
So I ran away from home with my brother

639
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,660
and became estranged from her.

640
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,960
But today,

641
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,850
I heard the person called my "mom"

642
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,590
passed away.

643
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,330
Maybe because I'm struggling...

644
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,570
my heart grows weak.

645
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,580
I keep thinking of him.

646
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,320
The first person...

647
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,500
who told me that he was glad I was born.

648
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,260
I keep thinking of him.

649
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,010
It's annoying.

650
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,640
   

651
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,990
Yun Seo.

652
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,050
It's Lee Seong Min.

653
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,910
Why are you calling me from Yun Seo's phone?

654
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:45,720
I know it's unpleasant to hear from a guy on your ex-girlfriend's phone,

655
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,910
but there's no need to be so aggressive.

656
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,090
Please explain what's happening.

657
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,850
Team Leader fell asleep after drinking.

658
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,220
 We're near the office. Please come get her. 

659
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,160
 But don't if you don't want to. 

660
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,100
I'm calling as a courtesy since it seems like she's not over you.

661
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,820
 - I'll assume you two are over–  
 - Ten  minutes.

662
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,660
Stay right there. I'm coming.

663
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,210
Don't look at me like that.

664
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,730
I felt so sad for her today.

665
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:47,030
Just for today, I thought it would be best if you were with her.

666
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,010
Did something happen to Yun Seo?

667
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,250
I don't know.

668
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,570
It's not my story to tell.

669
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,250
Ask her yourself when she wakes up.

670
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,690
If you two want each other so much, why did you break up?

671
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:13,380
It's none of your business.

672
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,280
Then take care of it.

673
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,540
What happened?

674
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,110
Nothing.

675
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,260
I just got a call.

676
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,730
Just ten more minutes.

677
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,820
What?

678
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,070
I'm sorry.

679
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:29,640
For making you spend today like this.

680
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,510
I'm sorry...

681
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:36,130
for everything.

682
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,940
No need to be sorry.

683
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,670
I think it's best to keep our distance and drift apart.

684
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,350
This won't happen again. Good night.

685
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:57,520
♫  Every scar, every tear  ♫

686
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,550
Are you okay?

687
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,240
♫  Clouds in your eyes  ♫

688
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,700
Can I ask you what's going on?

689
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:10,370
♫  Don't go alone  ♫

690
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,260
♫  Time  ♫

691
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,890
You don't have to worry.

692
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,030
If I call you again, don't answer.

693
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,330
You can ignore it. Actually, please just ignore it.

694
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,400
How could I not care?

695
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,390
♫  Fading you  ♫

696
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,180
♫  Fading you  ♫

697
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,970
How could I not pick up your call?

698
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:38,940
♫  Like a fog  ♫

699
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:46,470
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, it might all disappear  ♫

700
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:55,490
♫  So I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

701
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,940
Where were you? Why are you home so late?

702
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:37,330
It's a scary world out there.

703
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:40,550
You've been drinking a lot these days.

704
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,740
It's your birthday.

705
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,190
I know you don't like birthdays, but I thought we'd at least eat dinner together.

706
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,830
Hold on. Let me make you some honey tea.

707
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,040
Ji Seok.

708
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,240
You don't want honey tea?

709
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,540
I...

710
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,110
got a call today.

711
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,170
What call?

712
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,640
Mom...

713
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,810
has been in a nursing hospital.

714
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,760
Then her condition got worse,

715
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,200
and she passed away yesterday morning.

716
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,800
- The funeral– 
 - So?

717
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,190
So what?

718
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,230
Should we go there and wail?

719
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,260
Dress up in black and organize her funeral?

720
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,350
- Ji Seok... 
 - Nuna.

721
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:43,120
I still remember how she used to choke you.

722
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,880
- What? 
 - How she would grab you and cry every night.

723
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,750
Pushing you, hitting you, cursing you to get out.

724
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,910
When I was so hungry I cried, you made me porridge with the leftover rice.

725
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,860
And that woman...

726
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,380
cussed you out, saying you should be earning money instead.

727
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,140
You fed me porridge while covering my ears.

728
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,160
Why...

729
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:15,860
Why do you still remember that?

730
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,660
Is she a parent just for giving birth to you? I feel nothing for that woman!

731
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,690
You're my only parent, my only family.

732
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,110
You're my mom and my dad.

733
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,420
I don't need anyone else.

734
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,490
I never thought you weren't enough.

735
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,630
Nuna...

736
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:47,270
Was I not enough for you?

737
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,780
It's not like that.

738
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,630
Then don't go.

739
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,700
Neither you nor I have any reason to go.

740
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,070
Are you going to work?

741
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,950
Yeah.

742
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,910
See you.

743
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,600
Sure, sure. Don't worry.

744
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,800
Yes, Team Leader.

745
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,630
Got it. Bye.

746
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,030
What? What's going on?

747
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,130
What did she say?

748
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,610
Team Leader Ha won't be in today.

749
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,040
What?

750
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,580
Oh, hello, Director!

751
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,170
Good morning.

752
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,040
What brings you here this morning?

753
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,020
Well...

754
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,860
I heard Team Leader Ha isn't coming in today?

755
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,980
Yes, well...

756
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,490
 Did something happen to Yun Seo? 

757
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,510
 It's not my story to tell. 

758
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,110
 Ask her yourself when she wakes up. 

759
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,090
Who is this?

760
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:27,910
   

761
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:33,470
Why am I here?

762
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:02,920
   

763
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,230
   

764
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:21,900
   

765
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,220
   

766
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,370
How can they not show up to their parent's funeral?

767
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:06,570
They didn't even know that she was in the nursing hospital.

768
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:08,520
It must be the end of the world.

769
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,390
She hears that her mother is dead and hangs up on me.

770
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:15,040
I heard she has a son, besides the daughter who picked up.

771
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,020
They both have it coming for them.

772
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,710
   

773
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:20,060
   

774
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:24,650
How did you know?

775
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:27,070
Ji Seok called me.

776
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,690
He asked me to stay by your side.

777
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,660
Yun Seo.

778
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:37,260
Yun Seo!

779
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,270
Let go of me!

780
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,410
Why are you here?

781
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,570
Who are you to come all the way here? Why?

782
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,780
- Yun Seo. 
 - I don't know how much you've heard, but...

783
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,090
not every family is the same.

784
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,500
I don't consider that woman my mother.

785
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,460
I'm not sad at all.

786
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,460
So go.

787
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,990
Go!

788
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,040
So why are you crying?

789
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:29,590
You say you're not sad.

790
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,270
I don't know.

791
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,340
I don't know...

792
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,630
 ­  

793
01:03:57,150 --> 01:04:01,450
 I've never cried like that in my life. 

794
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:09,100
 When we first ran away from home and couldn't find a room, 

795
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:15,490
 when I couldn't do more for Ji Seok, 

796
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,940
-  I didn't cry.  
 -  It's okay. 

797
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:29,610
 Even though I grew up never hearing a proper "happy birthday," 

798
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,960
 I never cried. 

799
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,120
 ­  

800
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,340
 But at those hands patting my back silently, 

801
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:44,970
 the gaze that seemed to feel more pain than I did, 

802
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:50,870
 my sorrow became so overwhelming that 

803
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:53,230
 I broke down. 

804
01:04:57,990 --> 01:05:08,300


805
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,710
♫  Your scent is inside me  ♫

806
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:25,360
♫  You shake up my entire heart  ♫

807
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,770
♫  My eyes are covered, so I can't see  ♫

808
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:35,300
   

809
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,510
 Yun Seo, let's get married. 

810
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,330
 What? You proposed? 

811
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:42,100
 But I'm not going to beg. I'll just wait. 

812
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,630
 If you're going to do this, Ha Yun Seo will be unable to go anywhere. 

813
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:49,030
 Do you want to ruin her because of you? 

814
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,430
 I have to go to Spain suddenly. I'm leaving right now. 

815
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,200
 Seo Ju Won! 

816
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:59,880
 I'm going to chase after you now. 

817
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:06,010
♫  Throughout this long while  ♫

818
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:11,280
♫  My heart should fade  ♫

819
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:17,210
♫  But like a light that seeped through  ♫

820
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:25,900
♫  You come to me again and make me cry  ♫

821
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:39,760
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

822
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:46,570
♫  You help me fall asleep every night  ♫

823
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:52,110
♫  At the end of the day, I try to erase you  ♫

824
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:57,270
♫  But I'm still here  ♫

825
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:03,100
♫  Do you spend your day like this, too?  ♫

826
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,990
♫  A day missing you  ♫

827
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:21,010
♫  Maybe we feel the same way  ♫

828
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:26,970
♫  My struggling heart  ♫

829
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:32,630
♫  I've gone through countless nights  ♫

830
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:38,950
♫  You're inside me  ♫

831
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:46,600
♫  I can't end this like I want to  ♫

832
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:55,400
♫  Do you spend a day missing me?  ♫

833
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:07,600
♫  Maybe we feel the same way  ♫

834
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:13,660
♫  My struggling heart  ♫

835
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:19,130
♫  I've gone through countless nights  ♫

836
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:25,320
♫  You're inside me  ♫

837
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:33,400
♫  I can't end this like I want to  ♫
