1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,530
   

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,670
   

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,440
   

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,460
   

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,290
   

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:35,690


7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,190
   

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,000
 Team Leader! There's a fridge full of ice cream. 

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,770
 Plus a coffee machine and a massage chair! 

10
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,710
 Team Leader! Big news! 

11
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,310
 Check the company message board right now. 

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,800
- What's going on? 
 -  Hurry! Look at this! 

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
   

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,690
   

15
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,850
 What do I do? 

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,920
 He came back before I could even process the breakup. 

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,130
 From being a junior employee to the director. 

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,110
 From a boyfriend to an ex-boyfriend. 

19
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,640
   

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,150
 Where did you find something so cute? 

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,600
 I'm glad you think it's cute. 

22
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,250
Because you're so pretty.

24
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,450
­- What? 
 - What?

25
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,810
Did I just say that out loud?

26
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,900
­I...

27
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,030
I mean, that wasn't all of a sudden...

28
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,020
For a while?

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,080
No...

30
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,390
You look especially...

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,810
pretty today.

32
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,070
What? Ju Won, you're so funny.

33
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,370
I wasn't trying to be funny.

34
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,250
I meant it.

35
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,360
♫  I sleep without sleeping  ♫

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,670
♫  I dream without dreaming  ♫

37
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,980
But that's too bad.

38
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm not into younger guys.

39
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,990
I don't like older women, either.

40
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,280
- What? 
 - It's not that I like older women.

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,780
I like pretty women.

42
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,560
♫  Sweet drama, will it be there for me?  ♫

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,840
♫  Will I embrace love like it's love?  ♫

44
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,450
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.

45
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,970
♫  I promise you  ♫

46
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,600
I'll be careful moving forward.

47
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,340
♫  Sweet drama only we can make  ♫

48
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,190
Why would he say such a thing?

49
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,640
Thank you.

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,870
Okay, then.

51
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,220
They wanted to transfer me abroad,

52
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,320
but I convinced them to have me stay. That's why I'm late.

53
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,700
Why did you do that?

54
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,200
- That just makes us uncomfortable. 
 - I'm not.

55
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,000
If you want to break up with me, that's your right.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,970
But...

57
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,240
it's up to me to chase after you.

58
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,440
From now on,

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,770
I will cling to you.

60
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm going to be as pathetic as I can be.

61
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,170
Take pity on me, Yun Seo.

62
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,110
Director.

63
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,680
Vice Chairman is waiting for you.

64
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,900
Yes. Let's go.

65
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,480
See you later.

66
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,930
I must've surprised all of you.

67
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,670
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before.

68
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,910
No worries! There must be a reason you couldn't tell us.

69
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,470
I agree. We're sorry for not noticing.

70
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,310
You must've been flustered when I left my post for a week.

71
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,860
Thank you for understanding.

72
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,430
Understanding? Ju Won.

73
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,800
I mean, Mr. Ju Won.

74
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,700
I mean, Sir. You can go on vacation anytime you need to.

75
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,740
When I heard you went on vacation, Sir,

76
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,940
I thought, "Maybe he needs healing time." I totally got it.

77
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,000
Sir? Mister? Please don't be so formal.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,460
Keep teaching me the ropes like before.

79
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,710
I brought you coffee too.

80
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,150
This is for you, Deputy Bae.

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,460
- For you, Deputy Lee. 
 - Thank you.

82
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,200
You don't have to do this anymore.

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,400
I know you don't like it hot

84
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,140
so I took special care to get two sleeves.

85
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,310
Two?

86
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,720
Right, Deputy Bae would get so angry when you got only one sleeve.

87
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,090
Ye Yeong, wh-when did I get angry?

88
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,160
I wasn't angry. It's just my face.

89
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,760
Just an angry-looking face. It's a misunderstanding.

90
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,160
And this is for you, Team Leader.

91
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,700
Thank you.

92
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,150
But, Director, what brings you here?

93
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,610
You're not working around here anymore.

94
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,880
How can you say something so cold?

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,010
Here, here. Go ahead.

96
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,760
May I escort you to your office?

97
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,790
My office...

98
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,010
is right there.

99
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,120
How can this be the Director's office?

100
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,590
I got it remodeled over the weekend.

101
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,140
   

102
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,590
Oh, my, why...

103
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,700
Why didn't you go somewhere nicer?

104
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,050
I like it here the best.

105
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,410
I've learned so much from you all and want to keep learning.

106
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,910
I felt it was best to stay close, so I set up my office here.

107
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,250
They say out of sight, out of mind.

108
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,420
I don't want to be out of sight.

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,800
Then, should we get to work?

110
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,720
Yes...

111
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,700
What? What?

112
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,370
The youngest on our team is Chairwoman's youngest son

113
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,440
and Vice Chairman's brother?

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,950
On top of that, his office is right here? Is this real?

115
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,810
There are so many empty offices. Why over there?

116
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,550
I know!

117
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,940
Wait.

118
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,080
Maybe there's someone he wants to see here.

119
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,270
Someone he wants to keep seeing

120
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,040
and make them uncomfortable.

121
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,150
Hey!

122
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,540
Why would Ju Won, I mean the Director, want to make me uncomfortable?

123
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,080
What did I do?

124
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,790
I mean, I guess you didn't do much.

125
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,820
You just made him do coffee runs, criticized him for being slow,

126
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,900
badmouthed the company for having crappy benefits,

127
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,660
told him his hair was weird, picked on his appearance... Aigoo.

128
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,760
I should write my letter of resignation.

129
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,760
You should have known better.

130
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,250
Whoa.

131
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,650
It looks like our team leader might quit, not me.

132
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,700
What? Why would the Team Leader quit?

133
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,600
Hear me out!

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,950
She worked so hard, got promoted quickly before her peers,

135
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,750
but he got promoted even faster because of his parents!

136
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,770
She must be furious.

137
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,050
- You think? 
 - Of course.

138
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,980
   

139
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,700
What is this? What do you mean you'll chase me?

140
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,740
What do you mean you convinced the chairwoman?

141
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,620
I already explained. Why are you acting like you don't get it?

142
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,540
The chairwoman said if we break up, you'll get transferred abroad–

143
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,660
That was her plan,

144
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,690
but I convinced her to transfer me here.

145
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,000
You were able to convince her?

146
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,080
I pretended that you blindsided me and broke up with me.

147
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,660
If I said I heard from Hyeong, he'd get in trouble.

148
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,270
I thought you might be at a loss, too.

149
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,030
I said the breakup was so unexpected that I needed time to process it.

150
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,570
I told her if I went abroad now, I'd drink constantly and mess up at work.

151
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,470
What?

152
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,750
And I pitched a vision I prepared under a good team leader.

153
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,060
That I'll take the AL Card from No. 2 to No. 1 in the industry within two years.

154
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,340
If I don't succeed, then I will go abroad.

155
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,070
Is that possible in two years?

156
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,930
I'll have to make it possible.

157
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,190
If my mother wants to expand our business through a strategic marriage,

158
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,600
I'll prove that I can do it on my own.

159
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,630
That's how I can stay by your side.

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,410
Where is your pride?

161
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,190
I took money under the condition that I break up with you.

162
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,310
Ha Yun Seo likes money. That's nothing new.

163
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,280
Since when do I like money?

164
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,940
You stay at work late to get overtime pay and work on the weekends for the bonus.

165
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,750
That was just fulfilling my duty as a disciplined employee–

166
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,930
Anyway, I promised the Chairwoman that I would break up with you.

167
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,520
So you did.

168
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,980
Then you've fulfilled your promise. Can we date again now?

169
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,210
You didn't promise her that you wouldn't get back together.

170
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,380
What...

171
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,900
Wait.

172
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,200
But why are you suddenly speaking informally to me?

173
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,640
Actually...

174
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,200
I couldn't figure it out, so I looked up how to get your ex to come back to you.

175
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,300
It said the best way was to show them a new side of you.

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,900
It said one way for younger men to melt someone is to speak informally, Yun Seo.

177
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,230
I also read that this might make her melt.

178
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,010
Yun Seo, you're so cute.

179
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,210
What are you doing?

180
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,020
Why not? You're so cute.

181
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,960
What are you doing?

182
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,810
- What? 
 - So cute.

183
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,540
What are those two doing?

184
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,460
Those two... It can't be.

185
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,260
How do I explain this?

186
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,610
They caught us doing that. It's game over.

187
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,020
What you saw earlier...

188
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,500
It's okay.

189
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,180
- No need to explain. We get it. 
 - What?

190
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,670
But honestly, we feel betrayed.

191
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,400
How can he get ahead of us like that?

192
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
What?

193
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,100
Get ahead of us?

194
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,200
Yes! What he just did!

195
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,810
This thing! Pretending like you're cute because he got promoted!

196
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,020
This thing! Treating you like some kind of lowly puppy!

197
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,180
Petting you like that! That's what he was doing.

198
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,290
I know. I didn't think he was like that. I'm scared!

199
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,690
- That's not it... 
 - What do you mean?

200
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,410
Don't protect your pride.

201
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,520
You must be so upset. Your subordinate became a director overnight.

202
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,680
You went in there to scold him, then got overpowered.

203
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,210
If we don't get it, who will?

204
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,780
That's not it–

205
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,260
 Wait, is it better if they misunderstand? 

206
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,120
But when you think about it, this isn't the worst.

207
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,710
If he's willing to remodel an office just to be near us,

208
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,520
it means his memories with us aren't so bad.

209
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,970
It's not bad to get along with the owner's son.

210
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,300
This might be a pretty sweet deal for us.

211
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,580
You're right, but...

212
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,350
How come he never came across as a chaebol at all?

213
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,520
What? What do you mean? Maybe not a chaebol, but I knew he was rich.

214
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,610
He always smelled like money.

215
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,200
 His clothes were all luxury brands. 

216
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,290
Really? They never had logos. I thought they weren't branded.

217
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,540
No, no.

218
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,600
Real rich people never wear logos.

219
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,550
People who buy luxuries once in a blue moon wear ones with huge logos.

220
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,040
Aigoo... 
    

221
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,710
Now that I think of it, he was different at the convenience store.

222
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
 Here they are... 

223
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,060
   

224
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,090
 Ju Won! It's buy one, get one free. 

225
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,580
 I just need one. 

226
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,420
 What? He doesn't want a freebie? 

227
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,130
 Is he a chaebol or what? 

228
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,960
I trash-talked him, not knowing he was an actual chaebol!

229
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,750
On top of that...

230
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,600
 Daebak! 

231
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,100
 Wait, you said you couldn't make it to Deputy Oh's wedding, right? 

232
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,780
 I'll deliver the gift money for you. 

233
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,940
 Thank you. 

234
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,980
 I've never done this before. How much do people usually give? 

235
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,000
 For a work colleague, like five? 

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,800
 Five? 

237
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,100
 Here's 500,000 won. 

238
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
 I mean, not 500,000. 

239
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,740
 I meant 50,000 won. 

240
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,990
Laying down a cool 500,000 for a colleague's wedding?

241
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:09,390
Carrying that much cash in his wallet? It made no sense!

242
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,110
­Gosh.

243
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,500
See? 3,000 won.

244
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,760
This is the reality of office workers!

245
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,680
But 3,000 is so little.

246
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,970
I just carry this to get a pastry.

247
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,970
Anyway, when Ju Won first got here, I thought he was nuts.

248
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,190
I thought, "What kind of person is this?"

249
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,010
Now that I think of it,

250
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,970
it was all because he was a chaebol!

251
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,640
I should have paid more attention. How did I not catch that?

252
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,050
You didn't know, either, Team Leader. Right?

253
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,890
Well...

254
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,030
It must be confusing for all of you, but nothing has changed.

255
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,030
Please continue to do your jobs from where you are.

256
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,010
You might feel pressured by the director's office being so close,

257
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,460
but we won't have to see him as much as before.

258
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,830
- Okay. 
 - Got it.

259
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,120
 - Dinner? 
 - Yes. 

260
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,280
I feel like I caused you concern unintentionally.

261
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,990
You're working late, and I saw you head out to dinner. So, I want to treat you.

262
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,150
How does beef BBQ sound?

263
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,240
No, thank you. We decided on seolleongtang*. 
  (*Korean bone broth soup) 

264
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,110
That works, right?

265
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,710
Gosh. We didn't know the Director was going to treat us to BBQ.

266
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,800
That's right.

267
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,600
If we're talking about BBQ, seolleongtang is like a cow washing its toes in the water.

268
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,510
If we're eating out, beef BBQ sounds a hundred times better. Aigoo.

269
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,900
The place across the street is supposed to be amazing.

270
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,030
How does that sound, Director?

271
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,660
I'm into anything. Should we go?

272
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,120
Let's go.

273
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,260
I'm okay. I'll stay back and look over some paperwork.

274
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,460
Stop making us feel uncomfortable! It's not like we're eating noodles.

275
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,050
If you don't eat, how can we go eat? Let's just go.

276
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,930
He's right! Let's just eat quickly and come to work after. Let's go.

277
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,160
- Let's go! 
 - Well...

278
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,040
- Excuse me, I'm okay. 
 - Let's go get some beef!

279
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,080
Let's just go eat and enjoy.

280
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,990
What a great day we're having!

281
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:24,700
Soju and beer would make all this even better.

282
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,580
Soju and beer? We need to have a meeting after this.

283
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,410
I'm joking.

284
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,440
We've been working late nonstop to prepare for the presentation.

285
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,200
I'm just saying. Do you think I would actually drink?

286
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,320
Then should we have a drink tonight and delay the presentation?

287
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,180
Delaying the presentation for alcohol? That's nonsense.

288
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,700
It's not that.

289
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,610
I looked over the materials. It's lacking a lot.

290
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:58,140
Lacking? How? Which part do you mean?

291
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,530
Lacking time.

292
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,300
The timeline was tight to start.

293
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,690
When I left the team, you were short on hands.

294
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,670
I meant that it could be perfect with an extra week.

295
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,940
Right. You said that a few more days would help, Team Leader.

296
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,300
Right, right.

297
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,080
That's true, but...

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,190
Let's have a drink tonight to bond as a team.

299
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,550
Tomorrow, we'll work even harder.

300
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,670
Can we get some beer and soju over here?

301
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,120
And four more orders of sirloin, please!

302
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,600
I love this!

303
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,960
Ju Won!

304
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,010
Director.

305
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,600
I'm so sorry for everything.

306
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,270
Please don't fire me.

307
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,900
Why would I fire you? Don't say that.

308
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,270
Get home safely.

309
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,960
Seriously? Let me go with him. I'm going in the same direction.

310
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Sure, sure.

311
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,310
Promise me you won't fire me.

312
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,760
Promise me! Pinky swear!

313
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,980
Pinky swear.

314
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,960
Pinky swear? Go home!

315
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,550
- Get home safely! 
 - Okay!

316
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,150
Excuse me.

317
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Why are you following me, Director?

318
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,940
I wasn't following you. I'm going to the office too.

319
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,320
Stop lying! You're following me.

320
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,300
No, I'm not.

321
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,040
I thought you didn't drink so you could get back to work.

322
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,510
I'm doing the same. I have a lot to do, so I just had one beer.

323
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,840
All right then.

324
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,910
I have a lot of work. Bye.

325
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:53,770
♫  Every scar, every tear, one less spark, clouds in your eyes  ♫

326
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:04,730
♫  Fading you  ♫

327
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:13,260
♫  Fading you, like a fog  ♫

328
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,790
♫  If I try to reach you, to catch you  ♫

329
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,540
 I thought he would leave if I pretended like I hated him. 

330
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,170
 I thought he would accept it once he knew I took money. 

331
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,040
   

332
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,900
   

333
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,400
   

334
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,400
♫  The more I get to know ya, can't tell the feelings I feel  ♫

335
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,260
♫  Sometimes it doesn't feel so right  ♫

336
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,190
♫  Boyfriend, boyfriend  ♫

337
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,410
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

338
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,560
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend, boyfriend?  ♫

339
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,910
♫  Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend?  ♫

340
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:35,480
♫  Call me back when you're sober, I'm afraid I might just love ya  ♫

341
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,750
 And after that day, like his declaration of war, 

342
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,100
 he started to throw himself at me. 

343
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,220
What should we get for lunch?

344
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,620
How about crispy fried tonkatsu?

345
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,920
I love the sound of tonkatsu.

346
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,190
Director!

347
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,550
Are you going to eat with us?

348
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,000
Let's get some crispy tonkatsu.

349
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,580
Director, are you going to keep eating with us?

350
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,770
Yes.

351
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,860
I've been used to eating with you all ever since I started.

352
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,230
More than anything,

353
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,650
I like eating with you.

354
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,550
Me, too.

355
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,690
I'm heading out.

356
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,800
♫  When I call out your name  ♫

357
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
The bill, please.

358
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,500
One moment.

359
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,710
Okay.

360
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,080
♫  Sweet drama  ♫

361
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
What? What are you doing?

362
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,140
Sorry, I thought it was candy.

363
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,890
Candy? What?

364
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,990
Don't be like this at work.

365
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,200
We're not at work. We're in a restaurant.

366
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,230
You must be crazy!

367
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,720
♫  Before the morning comes, I'll hold your hand  ♫

368
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,470
Are you headed home?

369
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,520
Can you drive me?

370
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,510
Please stop it. You can't come onto me like this at work.

371
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,900
Then can I come on to you outside of work?

372
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:27,900
♫  When my heart full of feelings for you opens up  ♫

373
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,110
Are you okay?

374
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm not okay. Please go out with me.

375
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:45,210
What does that have to do with your foot?

376
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,530
Go out with me.

377
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,770
I'm hungry. Can you buy me dinner?

378
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,910
Buy dinner for a chaebol?

379
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,260
- Then can a chaebol pay? 
 - No thanks.

380
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,280
Why would we have dinner? What are we?

381
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,390
Exes?

382
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,670
If you know that, please go your own way, Director Seo Ju Won.

383
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,900
You're obligated to buy me dinner.

384
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,470
I did the math roughly.

385
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,240
While we were dating, I paid for dinner more often.

386
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,210
About 27 times more.

387
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,670
What? What a specific number.

388
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,340
Do you have proof?

389
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,050
Of course.

390
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,810
My phone.

391
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,000
I photographed everything we ate and did.

392
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,570
Plus, I can do the math from my credit card transactions.

393
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,160
Bye.

394
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,790
You're the one who said splitting is the new way.

395
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,340
Let it go. You're rich.

396
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,440
So are you. Pay with the money you got from my mother.

397
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,990
I'm going to spend that money slowly later.

398
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm not spending a penny on you, Director.

399
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,970
Wow. See? You love money.

400
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,480
That's why I'm perfect for you.

401
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,840
If you date me, you get money and me.

402
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,430
Buy one, get one free.

403
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,430
Buy one, get one free only goes so far!

404
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,720
Stop following me.

405
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,630
She's really gone.

406
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,690
 Are you really okay? 

407
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,880
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.

408
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
Ignorance is bliss sometimes.

409
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,500
No.

410
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Thanks for telling me everything.

411
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,580
I thought you might chase after Yun Seo

412
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,760
but didn't expect you to reject working abroad.

413
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,380
You've never gone against Mother.

414
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,680
She's never offered me a deal I wanted to refuse.

415
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,890
Alberto! Come out.

416
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:30,800
That little...

417
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,870
Hyeong, why are you dressed like that?

418
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,500
Who cares? I'm alone.

419
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,220
Ju Won, do you know when I'm glad that I'm in an arranged marriage?

420
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,870
- Do I need to know? 
 - Right now.

421
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,150
Right now.

422
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,060
Freedom like I've never experienced before.

423
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,100
As soon as we got married, my wife went to France, and I started living alone.

424
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,320
But wow...

425
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,730
All my life, I felt locked up, even at home, with all eyes on me.

426
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,950
I was so uncomfortable watching my behavior.

427
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,350
All that...

428
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,570
is gone. I am so comfortable.

429
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,510
I don't know how I got through it all this time.

430
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,990
Okay. Congrats.

431
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,500
- I'm leaving. 
 - Already?

432
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,700
Hey, come on!

433
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,300
You must feel down. Have another drink!

434
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,560
Hey, you don't feel like drinking?

435
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,920
Do you want to watch a movie?

436
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,910
You know, I set up a little home theater recently.

437
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,580
I want to watch romance movies and cry as much as I want.

438
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,290
Right.

439
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,220
You don't like movies.

440
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,570
I do.

441
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,040
- Watching movies is my hobby these days. 
 - What?

442
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,340
You said cinemas are dark and cramped.

443
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,170
You feel suffocated staring at the screen.

444
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,730
I did.

445
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,170
Going with Yun Seo makes it feel okay.

446
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,280
Yun Seo loves horror movies.

447
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,360
- Horror movies? 
 - Yes.

448
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,990
You especially hate horror movies, don't you?

449
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,340
 Ju Won is trying hard. 

450
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,890
It's easier said than done to chase an ex like that.

451
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,370
Hey. It's hard for me, too.

452
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,590
Worry about me. I'm your friend.

453
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,550
I'm saying this because you're my friend.

454
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,530
Honestly, so what if the mother is against it?

455
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,770
Right. Not everyone in the world can approve of you.

456
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,430
It's not that.

457
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,060
Yun Seo, if you look up our restaurant-

458
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,450
Not "our" restaurant.

459
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,630
My restaurant.

460
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,920
Anyway, if you look up CEO Yi Rae's restaurant, you see a score.

461
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,600
But some people give it one star, and some people give it five.

462
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,150
Even though they had the same food and makgeolli.

463
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,900
That's what life is.

464
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,000
So what if your future mother-in-law gives you one star?

465
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,040
The young master Ju Won is giving you five stars so generously.

466
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,690
You can't satisfy everybody in life.

467
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,920
That's what I'm saying.

468
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,390
Parents disapprove of their children's partners all the time.

469
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:11,480
That's right! To be blunt, your parents can oppose a chaebol son-in-law.

470
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,810
Get it together. She doesn't have parents.

471
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,890
Right.

472
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,620
Yes! Did you call for me?

473
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,530
Yes! Coming.

474
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,350
 How dare you talk back to me? 

475
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,580
 I told you to go buy some alcohol! 

476
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,510
 Look at you... Do I need to throw something at you? 

477
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,880
 Go! 

478
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,380
Yu Na! Give it to me. Mommy will carry it.

479
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,340
I can carry it. It's not heavy.

480
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,350
People will badmouth me if they see a kid carrying alcohol.

481
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,150
Does your dad need soju this badly?

482
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,310
Let's go.

483
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,170
- Do you have a cold? 
 - Yes.

484
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:38,130
I think I was out in the cold for too long yesterday.

485
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,790
If I had known, I'd have made some soup.

486
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,120
So you can have something hot.

487
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,420
Mess up my soup like you messed up your midterms?

488
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,720
Hey!

489
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,880
Cough or nag, pick one!

490
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,080
Eat.

491
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,060
The more I think of it, the more pissed I am.

492
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,420
That weakling made my sister stay out in the cold.

493
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,450
The weakling?

494
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:13,010
My sister's boyfriend. I don't like him.

495
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,490
It's so annoying.

496
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,950
Want to feel less annoyed and go play some games? Skip school?

497
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,500
No, I'm not skipping school.

498
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,040
Why not? You never study. Why do you even go to class?

499
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,110
My sister says not to skip class at the very least.

500
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,080
It's not like I'm paying attention.

501
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,390
You bastard!

502
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,380
Carry some cash.

503
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,470
Are you poor?

504
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,750
Next time, bring more.

505
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,560
What are friends for?

506
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,000
You should lend me some money when I need it.

507
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,600
It started as a joke, but it's getting worse.

508
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,830
I know. Are they still doing that?

509
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,900
Do something.

510
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,990
- They listen to you, though. 
 - I need money.

511
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,320
I need money.

512
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,870
Hey. Answer me!

513
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,300
- Why bother? 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

514
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,100
- Let's go. 
 - Why don't you answer?

515
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,520
Wait, please.

516
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,970
 The door is closing. 

517
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:39,330
 He said he heard from his brother. He knows I took the money. 

518
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,790
 He knows I dumped Ju Won. 

519
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,170
 This is so awkward. 

520
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,160
It's cold out today.

521
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,900
Yes, the temperature really dropped.

522
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,110
- Ju Won is bothering you a lot these days, right? 
 - Sorry?

523
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,750
He can be quite unpredictable sometimes.

524
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,300
He surprises those around him.

525
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,580
But it's cute, so it drives you crazy. Right?

526
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,760
Yes.

527
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,410
No.

528
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,750
Yesno?

529
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,330
I mean, I'm not feeling well.

530
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,430
I misspoke.

531
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,330
Your brother and I have already broken up.

532
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,400
So...

533
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,080
please don't talk to me about this at work.

534
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,580
Sure. Got it.

535
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,500
I was just giving you some information.

536
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
Information?

537
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,930
Ju Won is strong-willed and stubborn. No one can stop him.

538
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,510
I'm telling you, it won't be easy to beat him.

539
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,590
Sometimes, I think he has bigger guts than I do.

540
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,100
If he's met someone he really likes, he won't give up easily.

541
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:08,240
Actually, I was surprised when he told me about movies yesterday.

542
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,230
You made a kid who hated movies into a cinephile.

543
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,810
That was kind of unbelievable.

544
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,380
Pardon?

545
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,450
 Going down. The door is closing. 

546
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,390
Seo Ju Won doesn't like movies?

547
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,610
 - Here you go. 
 - We would always eat and watch movies. 

548
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,590
 If we liked a movie, we would often see it over again. 

549
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,480
Honey.

550
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,900
The Exorcist is back in cinemas. Want to go today?

551
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,620
 He knew about releases way more than me. 

552
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,590
 He doesn't like seeing movies? 

553
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,290
 Good morning. 

554
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,010
♫  I like the warmth  ♫

555
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,000
♫  Don't know at the start (The shine on my place)  ♫

556
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,510
♫  You laugh at my boring jokes  ♫

557
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,480
 What does he like besides movies? 

558
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,070
 The opera. 

559
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,240
 Did we ever go to the opera? 

560
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,350
 Honey, want to go to the opera next week? 

561
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,320
 No. 

562
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,270
 Right. 

563
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,930
Did that happen?

564
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,520
He never mentioned the opera again after that.

565
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,340
♫  Anyway  ♫

566
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,900
 Seo Ju Won, are you going to keep making me a bad person? 

567
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,530
Team Leader, could you take a look at this?

568
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,400
Yes.

569
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:59,620
♫  You listen to the stories that happen around me  ♫

570
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,780
♫  I just like thinking about you  ♫

571
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,310
   

572
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,610
What? When did you get here?

573
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,280
Just now.

574
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,160
I got you some porridge. You look tired today.

575
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,510
Director, aren't you busy?

576
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,500
I am.

577
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,650
But this is more important than anything else.

578
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,000
Eat this...

579
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,220
and take these. 
    

580
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,270
It's okay. I'm fine.

581
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,160
You don't look fine at all.

582
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,690
I'll take care of myself. Don't butt in. Go.

583
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,760
This isn't from your ex-boyfriend. It's from your colleague.

584
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,290
You're sick but still here because of the presentation.

585
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:10,570
Have some. Let me get you some water.

586
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,880
   

587
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,600
You don't look well.

588
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Why don't you take a sick day off tomorrow?

589
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,900
Maybe you forgot since you became a Director.

590
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,700
It's not easy for an office worker to take a day off.

591
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,000
Look.

592
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,800
This is the difference between you and me.

593
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,380
You can take a day off anytime.

594
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,700
I'm an office worker who struggles to take a day off.

595
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:01,030
Then give me your car keys. I'll drive you.

596
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,300
Take my help today.

597
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,200
I'm fine! I don't need your help, Seo Ju Won–

598
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,530
Yun Seo! Ha Yun Seo!

599
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,010
Yun Seo.

600
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,810
Yun Seo!

601
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,260
Are you awake?

602
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,660
Where am I?

603
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,680
This is the VIP room, right?

604
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,960
I'm heading out.

605
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,710
Where do you think you're going? Finish your IV.

606
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,690
I don't have time for this.

607
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,830
Workers compensation?

608
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,510
Workers compensation only goes so far.

609
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,660
What kind of company gets a VIP room for an employee?

610
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,110
This one.

611
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,030
Team Leader Ha Yun Seo sets the standard for benefits.

612
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,390
Well, you can be proud.

613
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,170
I'm really fine. I'm leaving.

614
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,600
Are you actually fine?

615
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,320
It looks like you're pretending to be fine.

616
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,500
Am I wrong?

617
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,270
Yun Seo...

618
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,470
I'm having a hard time.

619
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,050
I told myself I would do this,

620
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,200
but it's hard to keep getting rejected.

621
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,190
It's hard to watch you pretend like everything's fine when it's not.

622
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,180
If it's hard,

623
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,460
why did you do it?

624
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:56,050
I heard it's hard for you to watch movies.

625
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,540
I heard you don't like sitting somewhere cramped.

626
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,300
Why did you endure it?

627
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,150
Who said that?

628
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,250
The Vice Chairman.

629
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,620
We...

630
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,600
went out for a year and six months.

631
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,180
But I just found out today from someone else.

632
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,400
It wasn't on purpose. I...

633
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,600
Was it for me?

634
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,260
No.

635
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,220
For me.

636
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,230
I wasn't white-knuckling through something I hated.

637
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:43,240
I wanted to like the things Ha Yun Seo likes.

638
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,560
You're right.

639
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,580
Honestly, I was white-knuckling it at first.

640
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,420
 Those times were hard at first. 

641
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,040
 But it was cool to see you enjoy yourself so much. 

642
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,200
 When you watched something you liked, you were so pretty and shined. 

643
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,490
 So I watched another one, then another one. 

644
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,600
 I started enjoying myself, too. 

645
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,130
After that, I started to genuinely enjoy movies.

646
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,570
I even collect DVDs now.

647
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,790
It's more than just movies.

648
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,630
I couldn't eat spicy food before.

649
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,590
I didn't like mixing beer and soju because it's too strong.

650
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:48,530
I didn't like winter. Too cold. But I do now.

651
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,510
I wasn't white-knuckling myself through things I hated.

652
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:57,540
Thanks to you, there are more things I enjoy.

653
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,460
You should have told me earlier.

654
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:12,860
I never expected you to accommodate me so one-sidedly.

655
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,430
The opera might have felt strange and boring,

656
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,100
but if I knew how much you liked it,

657
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,400
I would have tried to enjoy it for you.

658
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,520
You never gave me a chance.

659
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,810
I'm sorry.

660
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,250
Let's...

661
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,300
eat together. Twenty-seven times.

662
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,660
What?

663
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:49,410
I don't like how you did it, but you tried for me all this time.

664
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,940
You tried hard at dating,

665
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,490
so let's try hard to break up.

666
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,040
I don't want to try hard at that.

667
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,040
But still.

668
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,800
I had a thought.

669
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,330
Maybe it's like a cold. You have to get over a big one.

670
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:17,600
Maybe that's how you get over emotions.

671
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,430
What?

672
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,000
Do you want to get over me like a cold?

673
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,090
Treating me like a virus?

674
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,700
Is that how it is?

675
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,270
Then I'll cling to you like an antibody.

676
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:32,740
Fine.

677
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,840
No matter how we eat, 27 times.

678
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,320
I just want to eat with you.

679
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,900
I'll show you how much I like you and why we should stay together for real.

680
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,220
♫  You're like a chore on a chaotic day  ♫

681
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,210
Here you are.

682
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,330
Thank you.

683
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:10,400
Enjoy.

684
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,600
♫  You were the one who helped me deal with others  ♫

685
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,630
Eat.

686
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,290
♫  Those confusing days of the past  ♫

687
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,800
♫  After facing the truth  ♫

688
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,080
♫  We are here now  ♫

689
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,780
♫  Just wake up, any time  ♫

690
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,030
 That's how we started eating together. 
  

691
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,440
♫  Can you be awake all night, wait for me?  ♫

692
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,720
♫  The moment I had with you  ♫

693
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,380
♫  Just follow me, all right  ♫

694
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:03,280
♫  No need to say anything, I can tell from your face  ♫

695
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,020
♫  I know you feel the same, I can always feel it  ♫

696
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,680
 You have to pour the sauce on the sweet and sour pork. 

697
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,050
♫  Just make a smile, anytime  ♫

698
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,000
♫  Seeing you makes me smile  ♫

699
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,840
 It felt like the start of a non-date date. 

700
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,330
♫  Wait for me, those moments with you  ♫

701
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,780
♫  Just follow me, all right  ♫

702
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,990
- So good. 
 - It's good here.

703
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,300
Try this.

704
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,550
This?

705
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:49,400
 While we were eating, it felt like we were back as lovers. 

706
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:56,700
♫  No need to say anything, I can tell from your face  ♫

707
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,660
♫  Do you feel the same?  ♫

708
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,000
♫  I can always feel it  ♫

709
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,200
♫  You're coming to me  ♫

710
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,230
Ju Won is upsetting you, isn't he?

711
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,230
I didn't want to take it this far.

712
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,570
I thought they broke up. Why are they still seeing each other?

713
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:52,940
From what I know, Ha Yun Seo is trying her best.

714
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,820
Ju Won is chasing her intensely.

715
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,910
Even if you gave your blessing, Ha Yun Seo would refuse.

716
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:04,430
That feels uncomfortable in its own way.

717
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:09,490
Just keep your eye on them. You know you can't cut someone off at once.

718
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,600
Anyway, she seemed responsible. I'm sure she'll keep her word.

719
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,000
Can you take care of these?

720
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,720
Don't let Ju Won see them.

721
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,700
Why not? You don't want him to see these?

722
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,700
Nothing good will come out of it.

723
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,110
Also, you're sure Ju Won doesn't know I met with Ha Yun Seo, right?

724
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:38,240
He doesn't know I'm taking these pictures, right?

725
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,560
Of course not.

726
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,820
So stop taking pictures like these and give them some time.

727
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:47,000
Ju Won will handle it.

728
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:53,260
But do you want Ju Won to have an arranged marriage?

729
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,020
You did the same,

730
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,240
but Father hasn't been back from New York for the past two years.

731
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,600
Mother, let me take care of these right away.

732
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,160
By the way.

733
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,670
Why are all the pictures of them eating?

734
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,620
Are you ready?

735
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,340
Okay.

736
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,800
But why do we seem like we're going for a foodie challenge?

737
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,690
So what? Let's go.

738
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,610
   

739
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,440
   

740
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,040
Ma'am, we're here.

741
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,560
Welcome!

742
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,530
We'll have the really spicy one.

743
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,010
- A bottle of soju as well. 
 - Okay.

744
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,980
Actually, no alcohol, please.

745
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,010
Okay.

746
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,630
What?

747
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,490
You always have soju. Why not today?

748
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,300
We said we would eat. Not drink.

749
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,450
Are you worried getting drunk will weaken your resolve?

750
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,370
- Weaken my resolve? 
 - You're holding it in.

751
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,560
If you drink, you might want to take back the breakup.

752
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,960
Ma'am, a bottle of soju over here!

753
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,110
Make that two.

754
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,440
 Okay! 

755
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:49,770
The car is waiting for you. You're headed home, right?

756
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:53,750
Could we stop by the wine store? I feel like a drink.

757
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,770
Sure.

758
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,910
Don't you have the 2000 vintage Chateau Doen?

759
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:07,030
I'm sorry. It's so expensive that not many ask for it.

760
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,360
But when Director Lee Mi Jin posted about it a few days ago,

761
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,480
there was a surge in orders.

762
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,940
My wife?

763
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,990
Yes.

764
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,370
   

765
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:29,030
She's quite an influencer.

766
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,850
What...

767
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,900
Did we have this at home?

768
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,490
When did we get it?

769
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,450
I don't remember getting it.

770
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,730
What a daebak event.

771
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,740
- So, you know their Chairman? 
 - Yes.

772
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,700
What is he like in real life?

773
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,410
He's exactly like how he is on the news.

774
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,380
So how do you call him?

775
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,200
Ahjussi.

776
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,800
- So weird. 
 - What?

777
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,030
I feel like I'm with a celebrity.

778
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,160
Plus, you seem so nonchalant about it.

779
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,440
Wow, Seo Ju Won.

780
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,650
Okay.

781
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,090
- Want some fan service from a celebrity? 
 - What?

782
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,130
Go away!

783
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,130
Aigoo...

784
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,620
You two are always so cute.

785
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,270
When is the wedding?

786
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:38,180
Ma'am, we broke up.

787
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,910
What? What are you talking about? For real?

788
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,980
Yes, we broke up for real.

789
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:46,880
So I'm being clingy, but she's stonewalling me.

790
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,950
Aigoo! Whatever! Broken up or not,

791
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,900
here's a bottle of beer on the house. Enjoy.

792
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,130
- Thank you. 
 - No!

793
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:58,610
Ma'am, no free bottle.

794
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,990
I need to empty out her wallet.

795
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,020
What? Is she paying today?

796
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:08,290
Yes. Twenty-two more times.

797
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,630
You don't know this, but this guy here is super rich.

798
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,760
But he keeps wanting to eat for free on me.

799
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,950
The rich are the stingiest.

800
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,130
Fine. If you pay 22 times,

801
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,800
I'll pay 220 times. That works, right?

802
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,830
Aigoo, come on now! Stop the lovers' quarrel.

803
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:30,080
Enjoy your meal and go.

804
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,080
It's not a lovers' quarrel. We really broke up.

805
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,120
I'm so sad.

806
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,110
So...

807
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,440
should we mix soju and beer?

808
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,670
- You just wait. I'll mix it in golden ratio. 
 - Okay.

809
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,570
- So good. 
 - Right?

810
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,870
Give me one.

811
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,810
Broke up? My ass.

812
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:31,100
They're hopelessly in love.

813
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,960
Why do you keep doing that?

814
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,390
Ju Won.

815
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,180
Seo Ju Won.

816
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:53,180
We should get home. Call a... I mean,

817
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,440
call your secretary.

818
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,450
Call him. I'm leaving.

819
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:18,230
Wh-What? What are you doing?

820
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,220
Yun Seo.

821
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:24,050
Let me ask you one thing.

822
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:29,680
Will you really break up with me?

823
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,550
Don't you like me anymore?

824
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:55,420
♫  Fading you  ♫

825
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,600
♫  Fading you  ♫

826
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,180
 Why did I do that? 

827
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,890
 The night was dark. 

828
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,400
 The wind was blowing. 

829
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,540
 We were drunk. Is that why? 

830
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,960
♫  So I just let the color wash over me  ♫

831
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,970
 I ended up telling him the truth. 

832
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,600
No.

833
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,230
I still...

834
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,740
like you a lot.

835
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,450
♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

836
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,440
♫  Every moment we'll go through  ♫

837
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,470
♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

838
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,410
♫  Every moment we'll go through  ♫

839
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:51,470
♫  Shining you  ♫

840
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:59,930
♫  Shining you, like a starlight  ♫

841
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:07,400
♫  When I look at it, follow it, it's always shining  ♫

842
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,040
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫

843
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,590
   

844
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:20,730
 I was the worst yesterday. 

845
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,530
 Husband! 

846
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,790
 What luck? He definitely remembers everything. 

847
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,200
 I think I was pathetic just now. 

848
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,500
 You can keep your promise to break up with Ju Won, right? 

849
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,870
 This is how she looks at my son? 

850
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,270
 Want to hang out with me tomorrow? 

851
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:41,750
 What? 

852
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:44,740
 Let's laugh a lot and hang out. 

853
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,610
 I want to spend one last day with you. 

854
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,540
 Can't we? 

855
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:03,960
♫  Fading you, like a fog  ♫

856
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:11,540
♫  If I try to reach you, catch you, you might just disappear  ♫

857
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:20,660
♫  I just let the color wash over me like this  ♫

858
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:29,390


859
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:33,490
♫  Every breath, every word  ♫

860
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:40,540
♫  Hold on tight, the lonely struggle  ♫

861
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:47,600
♫  Always by your side  ♫

862
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:55,990
♫  Time is treasuring us  ♫

863
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:59,530
♫  You know, right?  ♫

864
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:07,440
♫  Shining you  ♫

865
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:16,040
♫  Shining you, like a starlight  ♫

866
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:23,520
♫  When I look at it, follow it, it's shining on you  ♫

867
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:32,540
♫  You stay deep in my heart  ♫

868
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:36,490
♫  Looking at you makes it true  ♫

869

♫  Shining you, like a starlight  ♫

874
