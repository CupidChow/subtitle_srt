1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,519
(Episode 20)

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
All these years,

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,239
have you really not changed at all?

4
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Just see me off up until here.

5
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,799
What's wrong?

6
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,799
Are you still upset with me?

7
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,090
Are you not even going to say goodbye?

8
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,530
Can't you stay?

9
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,240
It's not like I'm not coming back.

10
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,159
And saying goodbye...

11
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,919
means we'll see each other again.

12
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,599
I'm going now then.

13
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
This time,

14
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,439
I don't want to let you slip away again.

15
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,199
Is this...

16
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
too sudden?

17
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm just a little surprised.

18
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
It's okay.

19
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Maybe...

20
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,759
we both need some time.

21
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,960
Wei Ran.

22
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Actually,

23
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
my feelings for you back then...

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,719
were just my own feelings.

25
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,439
They were really good memories...

26
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,919
of my youth.

27
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,560
But that's all in the past.

28
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,759
What about now?

29
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,730
Now...

30
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,839
Now, I think...

31
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,120
we need more time...

32
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,240
to figure out how we feel about each other.

33
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
Okay.

34
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,879
Then let's do as you said.

35
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,240
Let's give each other more time.

36
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Let's not talk about the past.

37
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,050
Let the future take its course.

38
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,519
Okay.

39
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
This time,

40
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,160
I don't want to let you slip away again.

41
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,079
You're up.

42
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Good morning.

43
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,240
Breakfast is almost ready.

44
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,959
- Let me help you. - It's okay.

45
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,279
Help me taste this coffee then.

46
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,279
What do you think?

47
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
I brewed this according to my habit.

48
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
It's pretty good.

49
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
You don't have to go to so much trouble anymore.

50
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,439
Just order delivery for breakfast.

51
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,680
If you want to eat home-cooked dishes,

52
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
hire a domestic helper.

53
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,959
No.

54
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,160
You don't like outsiders at home.

55
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,959
Besides, it's just making breakfast.

56
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,079
It's really easy.

57
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,439
I like it.

58
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,160
A while ago,

59
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,920
I was indeed in bad shape.

60
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,120
I'm sorry for keeping you from your work.

61
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
No, you didn't.

62
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,800
I can't always rely on you.

63
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,399
Otherwise, I'll feel quite useless.

64
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,879
I want to change...

65
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,279
and try more things.

66
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,240
Can you give me Ning Meng's contact information?

67
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,600
Why do you want her contact information?

68
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,120
Last time, she mentioned doing a design collaboration.

69
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I want to try it.

70
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,199
It was such a good chance to escape from singlehood.

71
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,519
Why didn't you seize it?

72
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,360
I can't believe you.

73
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,720
Who told you to tell him about the gift?

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,040
I was so embarrassed that I almost died.

75
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,600
I did it for the sake of your happiness.

76
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,600
You two wouldn't have progressed so rapidly last night...

77
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,639
without my intervention.

78
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,920
How great would it be if you said yes to him?

79
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,839
You used to like Wei Ran so much.

80
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
That was a long time ago.

81
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,879
That's exactly why...

82
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,199
it seems like your reunion was arranged by fate.

83
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,959
You used to like him,

84
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,399
but he had a girlfriend.

85
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,920
It wasn't meant to be.

86
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,039
But now both of you are single.

87
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,240
Fate has brought you together.

88
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,679
It's perfect timing.

89
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
You don't still like that ex-boss of yours, do you?

90
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,399
What are you saying?

91
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,330
That...

92
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,720
That tiny spark that ignited at the time...

93
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,159
has already completely died.

94
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,799
Then why did you turn Wei Ran down?

95
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,559
I don't know.

96
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,279
I just think...

97
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,879
he's not the same as he was in college.

98
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,399
That's normal.

99
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,720
Aren't you also different...

100
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
from when you were in college?

101
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,210
Not only have you guys changed,

102
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,679
but your situation has changed too.

103
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,399
You used to be the one chasing after him.

104
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,450
Now, he's pursuing you.

105
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,600
It's all up to you.

106
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,360
Give this more consideration, will you?

107
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,159
I got it.

108
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,480
Then I'll say one last thing.

109
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
I don't want to hear it.

110
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I have to tell you anyway.

111
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,090
Meng Meng.

112
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,759
It's not easy for you to be wandering...

113
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,919
in this big city alone.

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,519
Isn't it good to find someone who knows a thing or two...

115
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,919
to be with you and protect you?

116
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,840
If you encounter any difficulties in the future,

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,480
you won't have to endure them alone.

118
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,679
Isn't that kind of life good?

119
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
Ming Ming.

120
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,840
Do you not want me to go?

121
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,960
I remember you're an independent artist.

122
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,279
I don't think you've ever done...

123
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,360
this kind of business collaboration.

124
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,960
I was always indulged in my own world, painting.

125
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,919
I want to take this opportunity...

126
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,840
to connect with the outside world...

127
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,360
and share ideas.

128
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,919
It should be fun.

129
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
What do you think?

130
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,240
If it helps you,

131
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,879
of course I support you.

132
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,519
Okay.

133
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
I'll send her a message then.

134
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,399
No.

135
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,120
It's Sunday. Don't disturb her.

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,519
I'll contact her myself tomorrow.

137
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,450
There's no such thing as a weekend...

138
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,399
in the investment industry.

139
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,159
Stop forcing your own standards on other people.

140
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,960
"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."

141
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,639
A workaholic's life is so boring.

142
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Okay, I got it.

143
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I realize...

144
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,600
your clothes don't really have...

145
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,759
any color coordination.

146
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,399
I'm at home.

147
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Why does there need to be color?

148
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,039
It's the same for your work clothes.

149
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,919
They're all black, white, or grey.

150
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,360
It does look simple,

151
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,919
but it also seems a bit cold.

152
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,240
I bet your coworkers are all afraid of you.

153
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,039
No.

154
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Why would they be afraid of me?

155
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,759
Let me make some changes for you.

156
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
How?

157
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Why do you keep looking at me?

158
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Watch the road.

159
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Mr. Lu.

160
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,000
You look so handsome today.

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

162
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Mr. Lu.

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're handsome.

164
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,039
Something is going on.

165
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
If we want to eat this cake,

166
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,720
it will require strategy, organizational skills,

167
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
and taking the right direction.

168
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,440
The execution has to be highly efficient.

169
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,120
Focus, will you?

170
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Yang Xiao Yang.

171
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Yang Xiao Yang.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
- What are you doing? - I dropped my pen, Mr. Lu.

173
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I'm sorry.

174
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Let me continue.

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,080
From the rise of a market to its maturity,

176
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
it will go through this kind of business path.

177
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Look at milk tea,

178
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,679
e-commerce, and delivery apps.

179
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,799
Tell me.

180
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Didn't they all follow...

181
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
this business path?

182
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,159
All right.

183
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,799
That's all for today.

184
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mr. Ren.

185
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
What are you doing down there?

186
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Mr. Lu.

187
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,399
Do you have the link to where you bought your socks?

188
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,799
Mr. Lu, you look so handsome today.

189
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,000
There's also a hint of wittiness in your handsome look.

190
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,559
No matter how much you flatter me,

191
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,399
I won't give you a raise.

192
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,519
Meeting adjourned.

193
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
This is just in.

194
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,320
Spring is here for Mr. Lu.

195
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,759
Ms. Ning Meng.

196
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,000
I think Mr. Lu definitely got a girlfriend.

197
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,600
I wonder what Mr. Lu's girlfriend is like.

198
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I'm so curious.

199
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,000
She must be very beautiful.

200
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,840
I've never seen Mr. Lu like this before.

201
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,679
He's usually like a volcano.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,799
I thought only you were able to hold down this volcano.

203
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,159
Hello.

204
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,879
Hello, is this Ning Meng?

205
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm Han Yi Meng.

206
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,120
Yes, I am Ning Meng.

207
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Hello.

208
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,360
Regarding the collaboration you mentioned...

209
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
at the exhibition last time,

210
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,080
I want to try it.

211
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,720
Really? That's great.

212
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
How about this?

213
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,879
I'll arrange for you to meet the other party.

214
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,840
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

215
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,360
Hello.

216
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,000
It's the great artist, Ms. Han Yi Meng.

217
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,639
You look even more elegant and beautiful in real life...

218
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,000
than in your photos.

219
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,840
This is the founder of Mobi Sport, Lin Da Yi, Mr. Lin.

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,799
- Hello, Mr. Lin. - Hello.

221
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,919
Hello, Mr. Lin. I'm Lu Ji Ming.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
Are you Mr. Lu from Joint Capital?

223
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
A famous artist and a famous investor...

224
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,519
are both here at our little company today.

225
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm so honored.

226
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,279
Come on. Please come in.

227
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,519
Let's go.

228
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,559
Watch your step.

229
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,720
Ms. Han's paintings...

230
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,759
surely convey a strong artistic conception.

231
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,080
This really matches the charisma of our products.

232
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

233
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,519
Mr. Lin.

234
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,960
We've already looked at the collaboration details.

235
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,080
- We're very interested. - Really?

236
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
That's great.

237
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,319
Let me put it this way.

238
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,480
It's our honor to be able to collaborate with Ms. Han.

239
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,200
Yes. We're looking forward to the sparks we create...

240
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,410
through this collaboration.

241
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,839
Mobi Fitness Equipment already has...

242
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,920
a very good appearance to begin with.

243
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:21,039
Other than its practicality,

244
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,559
it can also serve as a high-class home decoration.

245
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,680
That's rare in the same type of products.

246
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,039
That's right. Look at that.

247
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,680
Ning Meng hit all the right points.

248
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,890
Mr. Lin, you can communicate with me...

249
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,920
regarding the contract later on then.

250
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,039
Sure, no problem.

251
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
Mr. Lu, you sure are thoughtful towards your girlfriend.

252
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,799
I'm right, aren't I?

253
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,650
You two are boyfriend and girlfriend, right?

254
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,319
A talented man with a beautiful woman.

255
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,039
What a great match, right?

256
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,960
All right. I look forward to working with you.

257
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,119
- I look forward to it. - Thank you.

258
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

259
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
Did Ning Meng...

260
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,519
use to be your secretary?

261
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,039
Yes. Why?

262
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,359
It's nothing.

263
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,839
I just think she's quite capable and experienced.

264
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,680
She thinks very thoroughly.

265
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,559
She's very competent.

266
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,680
That's because I trained her well.

267
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,920
What are you looking for? Let me help you.

268
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,079
No, I'll do it.

269
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,240
Xiao Song always leaves things in random places.

270
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,170
Hello, Peng Fei.

271
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,170
Okay.

272
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,960
Help me entertain Mr. Hu first.

273
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,650
Brief him on the project.

274
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,720
Put emphasis on modularization and technological empowerment.

275
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,650
I'll be there in half an hour.

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Do you have to work overtime tonight?

277
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,440
No.

278
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,559
I just have a meeting in the afternoon.

279
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,119
I'll have dinner with you tonight.

280
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,759
You just signed your first business deal.

281
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
This calls for a celebration.

282
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,559
Sure.

283
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll make steak at home.

284
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,079
There happens to be wine at home.

285
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
That's great.

286
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm in for a treat tonight.

287
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,279
Meng Meng, you're right.

288
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,839
She's quite a sensitive and delicate person.

289
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,799
I can't believe it.

290
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,359
How did she and that hot-tempered Mr. Lu...

291
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,920
get together?

292
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,170
I guess they complement each other.

293
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,720
I saw them together today.

294
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,039
They look quite good together.

295
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,319
Do you really mean that?

296
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,759
Are you really over him?

297
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Of course.

298
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,039
Meng Meng.

299
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,119
It looks like you've really matured.

300
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Of course.

301
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:24,240
You can only pick something up if you learn to let go.

302
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,759
I just want to focus on my career...

303
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,039
and doing my projects well now.

304
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,279
Hearing you say that...

305
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,920
means you're still not mature enough.

306
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,079
You could totally grasp your career in one hand...

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
and love in the other.

308
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,079
Greed will only end up harming you.

309
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,920
You know what they say.

310
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:42,279
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

311
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,039
It's the cake.

312
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,119
Hurry up. The cake!

313
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Hello, cake.

314
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,319
Wei Ran.

315
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,599
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

316
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,170
No, you aren't.

317
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,359
Go ahead.

318
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,240
Are you free this weekend?

319
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,440
Do you want to watch a movie with me?

320
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Is it inconvenient for you?

321
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,920
No, it's not.

322
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,799
I'm free.

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's great.

324
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,559
Set a time and let me know.

325
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,039
Okay.

326
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,559
Pick a movie you like.

327
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
See you this weekend.

328
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,240
See you this weekend. Bye.

329
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,599
What did I tell you?

330
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,890
You have it all now.

331
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,599
Let me check...

332
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,119
what romantic movies are showing this weekend.

333
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,720
Romantic movies? No way.

334
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,960
That's awkward.

335
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,890
I don't really watch romantic movies anyway.

336
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,319
What movie do you want to watch?

337
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,359
Animation, sci-fi, suspense. Any of those are fine.

338
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm going to find a romance for you anyway.

339
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,759
You're back.

340
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,400
Did you do all this decoration?

341
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,799
The house is filled with cold colors.

342
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,440
I added some colors and flowers to harmonize them.

343
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:10,799
What do you think?

344
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
It's nice.

345
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,119
How is it?

346
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,519
It's good.

347
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,119
Try the steak.

348
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,640
I still remember you used to eat really fast when you were young.

349
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,720
You gulped your food down without chewing.

350
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,160
My dad trained me to be like that.

351
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,960
Mr. Lu used to be really harsh on you.

352
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,160
You had to eat on time every day.

353
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,920
And he insisted on not letting you watch TV while you were eating.

354
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
You had to finish dinner in half an hour...

355
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,240
and do your homework right away,

356
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,519
or else he would throw away your food.

357
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,839
Yes.

358
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
I was traumatized back then.

359
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,279
Right.

360
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,240
Mr. Lin sent over the contract.

361
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,039
I think there are a few parts that are not strict enough.

362
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,319
I'll amend them tonight.

363
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,960
We can talk to him about it tomorrow.

364
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,359
You can take care of the contract. I'm not worried.

365
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
By the way, Ming Ming,

366
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,640
if we'll be cooking at home often,

367
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
should we consider buying...

368
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,359
a garbage disposal unit?

369
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,839
That's good.

370
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,880
I saw a garbage disposal unit project...

371
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,440
a while back.

372
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,759
I even did due diligence on the company.

373
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Is that so?

374
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,839
I used one a lot when I was abroad.

375
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,839
It's very convenient.

376
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,519
Dishwashing and food waste disposal...

377
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,319
are the two biggest problems...

378
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,000
for those who cook.

379
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,799
Did you invest in this project?

380
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,039
No.

381
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,599
Why not?

382
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,279
In my opinion,

383
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,319
from an eco-friendly perspective,

384
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,279
whether the discharge method of the unit...

385
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
is truly reasonable...

386
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
is yet to be determined.

387
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,920
Here is the most important thing. Look.

388
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,160
Our eating habits in China...

389
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,799
are very different from other countries.

390
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
We eat a lot more varieties of food.

391
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,319
There's a lot of oil too.

392
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,359
Over time,

393
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
oil residue may accumulate easily...

394
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,359
and plug up the drain.

395
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
The clean-up and maintenance that comes after that...

396
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,880
will cause a headache.

397
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,960
Why did I start talking about all that?

398
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,839
It's okay. Come on.

399
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Cheers.

400
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,559
Why don't we go out and relax this weekend?

401
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Sure.

402
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,799
Do you want to see Munch's exhibition?

403
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,039
Sure.

404
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,880
Or we could go to a concert or watch a movie.

405
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:57,519
You choose.

406
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,799
I'll arrange it then.

407
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,599
Five and six.

408
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,759
- It's here. - We're sitting here.

409
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,400
Do you like comedies?

410
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:33,839
Do you not like them?

411
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I like them too.

412
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,920
I just don't get to watch them often.

413
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,240
The movies I watch are so boring.

414
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,400
You'd probably fall asleep.

415
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,519
I think comedies are pretty good.

416
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,200
Work is usually quite stressful.

417
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,559
- We're sitting here. - Okay.

418
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,359
What's wrong?

419
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,480
I was saying...

420
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
that work is quite stressful.

421
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,759
Watching a comedy can cheer us up.

422
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
That's right.

423
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,799
It's starting.

424
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
Thank you.

425
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
- What about the circus? - Nonsense!

426
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Do you know how hard it is to get tickets to that circus?

427
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,119
No, getting tickets is a piece of cake for you.

428
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Think of something.

429
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,119
Can you sit down? You're blocking my view.

430
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,680
It's such a big screen. How can I be blocking your view?

431
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
You are.

432
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,079
Handsome, give me two tickets.

433
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,119
I'm sorry. We're sold out for the day.

434
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,319
It's still so early, yet you're sold out?

435
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,640
Handsome!

436
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
You first.

437
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,119
- Let's go. - Let's go.

438
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
- It was a pretty good movie. - Wait for me.

439
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,079
Get your stuff. Don't leave them behind.

440
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Let's go.

441
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,359
Let's finish watching the credits.

442
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,240
There may be a bonus scene.

443
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,039
You must really like this movie.

444
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,319
I quite liked it.

445
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,640
- Let's go. - Okay, I'll hold it for you.

446
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,680
The movie was quite good. It was interesting.

447
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,799
Yes.

448
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,039
Plus, after watching comedies like this,

449
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:20,039
I do feel quite happy.

450
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Mr. Lu.

451
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Mr. Su.

452
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,519
Ning Meng.

453
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Mr. Lu.

454
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,079
Ms. Han.

455
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You're here too.

456
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
This is...

457
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,079
Hello, I'm Han Yi Meng.

458
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Hello, I'm Su Wei Ran.

459
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What a coincidence.

460
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Yes.

461
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,519
What a coincidence.

462
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,359
It's rare for us to have time to relax.

463
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,279
Ning Meng likes watching comedies.

464
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,319
Then I guess your ticket money has gone to waste.

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,279
I don't think this movie was very good.

466
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
I couldn't laugh at all.

467
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,759
We won't disturb you then.

468
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,960
We'll get going now.

469
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,720
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

470
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,839
Bye.

471
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,200
I thought it was pretty funny.

472
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,319
Exactly.

473
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Let's go.

474
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,880
That Mr. Su...

475
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,640
Is he Ning Meng's boyfriend?

476
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Who knows?

477
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,039
They look good together.

478
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,000
Their height difference is so cute.

479
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,519
Cute?

480
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,079
Isn't she tired of looking up all the time?

481
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,160
Ms. Han is Mr. Lu's girlfriend, right?

482
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,759
What does she do?

483
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
She's a painter.

484
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
No wonder.

485
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,240
She clearly has an artistic temperament.

486
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,559
I didn't expect Mr. Lu to like this type.

487
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,119
They look good together.

488
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
That's true.

489
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,079
But...

490
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,599
maybe they feel the same way looking at us.

491
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Ning Meng.

492
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,119
Actually, I asked you out today...

493
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,599
to thank you properly.

494
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,680
For what?

495
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,039
Do you remember the AR glasses we saw together a few months ago?

496
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,680
At that time, we had different judgments.

497
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,279
But during this time,

498
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,880
I thought about it carefully...

499
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,440
and decided to find corporate-class usage scenarios...

500
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,039
on the business side.

501
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,359
Once the quantity increases and the cost goes down,

502
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,240
we'll target the consumer market.

503
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,359
This way,

504
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,960
the entire logic of the investment becomes clear.

505
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,839
Are you going to invest in it?

506
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,240
We just signed the letter of intent.

507
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,559
As for the rate of return,

508
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,720
we'll leave it to time.

509
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,200
We'll consider it...

510
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,880
as giving a little support...

511
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,559
to our nation's scientific community.

512
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,359
It's meaningful.

513
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,359
Ning Meng, thank you.

514
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,799
You helped me complete this project.

515
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,160
You thought up the investment logic yourself.

516
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,799
I didn't do anything.

517
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,480
You made me realize it.

518
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,079
You're right.

519
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Other than money,

520
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,759
there is also spirit and love...

521
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,519
in people's lives.

522
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Ms. Shi.

523
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Ning Meng.

524
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,720
Let me show you the sketches of Mobi's collaboration collection.

525
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,680
Lin Da Yi is a man of action.

526
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,240
I wish my projects could progress this efficiently.

527
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,920
They're really pretty.

528
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Even I want one for my house.

529
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,160
It won't be too hard to snatch one, right?

530
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,599
Don't worry.

531
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,240
I'll get one for you. I have good luck.

532
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:58,039
I even got a train ticket during the Spring Festival.

533
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,880
I see you're very confident...

534
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,920
in the popularity of this collection.

535
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Have Ms. Han and Mr. Lu known each other for many years?

536
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,839
I find it quite weird.

537
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,240
How does someone with a personality like Mr. Lu's...

538
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,400
get along with a famous artist like Ms. Han?

539
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,279
- It's Mr. Lin. - Answer it.

540
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Mr. Lin.

541
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Ning Meng.

542
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,759
How much do you know about Han Yi Meng?

543
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
What's the matter?

544
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,039
It's like this.

545
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,519
I've already called for a stop on the backboard printing.

546
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,039
There's a problem with the copyright of the drawing.

547
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
What?

548
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,440
When the marketing team was preparing information,

549
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,720
they discovered there's a painter named Sui Tang in the US.

550
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,480
He has a painting on exhibition recently...

551
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,160
and it's so similar to the painting that Ms. Han provided.

552
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Moreover, he already registered the copyright in the US.

553
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,519
I'm glad we found out earlier.

554
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,400
Otherwise, if we wait until the products are released,

555
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,480
who knows what kind of trouble might arise?

556
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,200
Mr. Lin, don't be anxious.

557
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,359
I'll go and find Ms. Han now.

558
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,319
I'll get back to you once I look into it.

559
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,039
Okay. I'll be waiting.

560
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Okay, bye.

561
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,519
What's wrong?

562
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,159
There might be a problem...

563
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,159
with the copyright of Ms. Han's painting.

564
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,329
I have to go find her now.

565
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,329
It's not convenient for you to go.

566
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,599
Why don't we get someone else?

567
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,519
It's okay, Ms. Shi.

568
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,719
It's not inconvenient.

569
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,329
I'll go now.

570
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,119
That's all I know.

571
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,559
Ms. Han.

572
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,519
What exactly is the situation?

573
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:50,079
This guy called Sui Tang...

574
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,440
is Yi Meng's ex-boyfriend.

575
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,960
Then who created...

576
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,809
this painting?

577
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,239
Ning Meng.

578
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:06,519
What do you mean by that?

579
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,519
Do you suspect her too?

580
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,039
I just want to understand the situation.

581
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,079
What's the situation with Lin Da Yi now?

582
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,880
The factory has stopped printing for now.

583
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,519
They stopped printing?

584
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,639
That makes us look guilty.

585
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:29,639
We all want to believe Ms. Han.

586
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,719
But this can't be solved simply by believing her.

587
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,039
Ning Meng.

588
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,199
My personal matters brought you such big trouble.

590
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
We can terminate our contract.

591
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,960
I can pay for all the damages. What do you think?

592
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,119
You can't do that.

593
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,480
Then you'll be forced to suffer in silence.

594
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't agree with that either.

595
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,360
This isn't about terminating the contract right now.

596
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,199
I know a piece of work...

597
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,519
is very important to an artist.

598
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,239
I also believe you poured a lot of effort and affection...

599
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,599
into your work.

600
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,679
What we have to do now...

601
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,079
is to get to the bottom of this.

602
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,719
To be honest,

603
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,199
it has always been hard for me to bring this up.

604
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,960
I also didn't want to face it.

605
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,679
But this has caused so much damage...

606
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,239
to you and your companies.

607
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,199
I think there are some things I have to explain.

608
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,719
We met in the US.

609
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,329
It was at my graduation exhibition.

610
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,239
Back then, he was already quite a famous Chinese painter.

611
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,199
I admit it.

612
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,239
I was attracted to his talent.

613
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,400
During the years I was with him,

614
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:57,880
I had a surge of inspiration.

615
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:00,769
This painting you're using...

616
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:02,809
was created during that time.

617
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,400
But later on,

618
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,079
the problems in his personality...

619
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,599
gradually started to show.

620
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,880
He's very controlling.

621
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,639
He wanted to control my life.

622
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,400
He even interfered with my work.

623
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,769
Whenever he was upset,

624
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,289
he would belittle my work.

625
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,769
He would even negate me as a person.

626
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,679
That's the reason I broke up with him.

627
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,719
Of course, that's not the only reason.

628
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,809
When we were about...

629
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,920
to get engaged,

630
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
I discovered...

631
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,239
that he had another woman.

632
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,719
What a jerk.

633
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,519
As an artist,

634
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,519
you have to keep challenging...

635
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,559
and surpassing yourself.

636
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
But I know...

637
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,039
he doesn't have the ability anymore.

638
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,809
So he plagiarized this painting of yours, right?

639
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,159
I got it.

640
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,400
Ms. Han, I'll explain it to Mr. Lin.

641
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,000
But with only this,

642
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:30,289
it's not very convincing.

643
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,440
After all, they hadn't broken up yet...

644
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,119
when she painted this.

645
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,639
We need to have strong evidence.

646
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:46,769
Ms. Han.

647
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,289
In every one of your paintings,

648
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,679
I see there's a bird.

649
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:53,239
Does it mean something?

650
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,360
This is an element I put in all my creations.

651
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,079
It's because I like the meaning of birds.

652
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,000
It represents...

653
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,239
how people yearn for the sky.

654
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,840
There's the meaning of freedom and hope,

655
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,599
and at the same time,

656
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,239
it represents the shackles and fate that come with it.

657
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,480
I remember when I was in college,

658
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,440
I held an exhibition.

659
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,039
There was a painting...

660
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,119
that was very similar to this painting.

661
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:33,769
I remember it.

662
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,519
Someone bought it in the end, right?

663
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,599
Do you remember who bought it?

664
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,519
I think it was someone who runs an art gallery.

665
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,840
I don't remember his name.

666
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,289
He gave me his business card.

667
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,769
- I just slipped it into a book. - What book?

668
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,289
It has been so long.

669
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,769
I forgot whether it was a book...

670
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,519
or an art book.

671
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,639
Where is it?

672
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,119
My parents definitely wouldn't throw it away.

673
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
I think it's in our old house.

674
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,880
Hello, Mr. Qian.

675
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
I already told you the details just now.

676
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,289
Is this enough evidence...

677
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,769
to prove the artist's innocence?

678
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:52,559
Okay.

679
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,480
I'll find the painting as soon as possible.

680
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,199
Bye.

681
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,719
What did the lawyer say?

682
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,239
It's as we expected.

683
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,559
Finding the painting is the key.

684
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,519
How are things going with Mr. Lin?

685
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,119
I bought us three days' time.

686
00:41:09,289 --> 00:41:10,599
He'll deal with the shareholders.

687
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,519
Lin Da Yi is quite righteous in times of need.

688
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
You were right about him.

689
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
Yi Meng.

690
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:27,400
Don't worry.

691
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
This will definitely be resolved.
