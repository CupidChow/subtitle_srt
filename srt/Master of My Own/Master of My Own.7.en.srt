Qiu Junlin, are you out of your mind?

4
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,800
Do you think you know me so well?

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,370
Do you believe that I can use your trick

6
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,000
to slander Ning Meng on you?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you'll be unable to work in the investment field anymore.

Goodbye, Mr. Qiu.

Hello, Xiaoyang.

10
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,510
Meng, let me tell you. Qiu Junlin was the one who spread the rumors.

11
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,360
Qiu Junlin?

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,370
You have no idea. Mr. Lu scolded Qiu Junlin very fiercely.

13
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,370
Mr. Lu was so cool and so manly.

14
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,110
Was...

15
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,640
Was my scolding very horrible?

16
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,190
It was as bad as how Mr. Lu scolded Qiu Junlin.

17
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,930
Meng, you've blamed Mr. Lu wrongly.

18
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,240
Apologize to him quickly.

19
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,540
I must hang up now. I have to get back. Bye.

Mr. Lu, I might have spoken irresponsibly.

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,450
You understand how alcohol works.

35

Take a seat.

- Here.
- Thank you, Ms. Shi.

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
Are you nervous?

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,550
You weren't like that when you were with Mr. Lu.

53
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,550
Did you find a new job?

54
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,610
No.

55
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,720
The investment field values working experience and seniority.

56
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,800
I actually have a good impression of you.

57
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Do you want to try working here?

58
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,780
Eaglestone Capital is newly founded.

59
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,340
We're still in the stage of exploring and pioneering.

60
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,170
I don't want to be bound by anything when I recruit.

61
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,740
I only care about this.

62
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,330
I believe in one line.

63
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,700
One who is capable takes the position.

64
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,780
Ms. Shi, your sudden words have really flattered me surprisingly.

65
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,750
There's nothing surprising.

66
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,060
I mentioned it when I was at Mr. Lu's.

67
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,730
You have great potential in investment.

68
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,830
May I ask why you left Joint Capital?

69
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Actually, Mr. Lu values my capability as a secretary.

70
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,290
He wanted me to stay as a secretary.

71
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,170
But my dream was to work in investment.

72
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,320
So I'd rather leave Mr. Lu's circle and find a new job.

73
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,060
Mr. Lu and I have a strategic partnership.

74
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,840
If you work here, you may have to be in touch with him.

75
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,870
Just like you said, you may not be able to leave his circle.

76
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,060
Do you mind?

77
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,420
To be honest, I was just thinking about this problem a few days ago.

78
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,400
I did mind then.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,420
But I've figured it out.

80
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,280
The past three years in Joint Capital are my experiences.

81
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,820
I've learned a lot from Mr. Lu.

82
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,270
Besides, if I work in investment, it's inevitable to have contact with Mr. Lu.

83
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,190
The last question.

84
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,510
Are you willing to join Eaglestone Capital?

85
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,430
Of course, I'm willing.

86
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,840
You scared me.

87
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,740
I love your enthusiasm. Sit.

88
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,110
Start working on Monday.

89
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,910
But before you become an investment manager,

90
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,240
I would like you to first work as an analyst

91
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,010
to go through the most basic stage.

92
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,680
This is also a process of accumulating experience. Is that okay?

93
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,150
Of course. Let alone an analyst, I can even start as an intern.

94
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,250
Welcome to Eaglestone Capital.

95
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,120

I'm Tang Ya of the Project Department.

97
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,320
I'll arrange for you some basic work.

98
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,540
If you have any questions, you may ask me.

99

Thank you, Ms. Tang.

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,710
Don't call me that. Ya is fine.

101
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,770
- Everyone calls me that. Our company doesn't care about this.
- Okay

102

Which one is yours?

117
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,830
This cactus.

118

Yes, it's not fastidious.

This one as well.

128
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,180
It bears fruits after a while.

Got it.

134
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,290
For this kind of project, look at the market share first.

Then compare it to those of a similar type. Then there's the basic judgment.

166
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,050
Here's the thing. Tomorrow,

167
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,130
the flagship store of the Kirin Furniture Art Gallery is opening.

168
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,860
I want you to go with me.

169
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,460
What's wrong?

170
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,620
Are you afraid to meet Mr. Lu?

171
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,960
Here's my thought. You introduced this project to me

172
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,680
when you were in Joint Capital.

173
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,590
It also contributed to the first cooperation between Mr. Lu and me.

174
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,690
Hence, I think you should go and say hello to Mr. Lu.

175
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,130
It won't be awkward when I'm with you.

176
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,350
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Shi.

177
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,840
There's another thing.

178
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,520
I've always wanted to talk to you about.

179
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,580
Right now, you're at an investment post.

180
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,070
The way you dress should be different from how you were as a secretary.

181
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,630
Do you know?

182
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,510
An image change can cause an attitude change.

183
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,540
Look. Your eyes are beautiful.

184
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,750
Why do you always wear glasses?

185
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,690
I'm too busy, so wearing glasses is more convenient.

186
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,790
Are you busier than me?

187
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,620
So that's just an excuse.

188
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,490
You must know that dressing up elegantly at the workplace

189
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,900
isn't just respect for yourself and the others,

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,000
more importantly, it's a symbol of ability.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,980
A symbol of ability?

192
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,100
It means you can take care of work and life calmly

193
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,200
and you're not exhausted.

<i>[Kirin Furniture]</i>

195
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,960
- You said Ning Meng is on the guest list?
- Yeah.

196
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,580
I don't see her.

197
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,980
She must be ashamed to see me.

198
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,650
Her face is still the same, but...

<i>[Kirin Furniture Flagship Store Opening Cocktail Party]</i>

200
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,510
- Ms. Shi.
- Long time no see.

201
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,200
Long time no see.

202
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
Hello, Mr. Lu.

203
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,250
Can't you recognize her?

204
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,410
Let me reintroduce her.

205
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,730
This is Ning Meng of the Investment Department of Eaglestone Capital.

206
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,940
Turns out that when she's with you

207
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,870
even her shortsightedness is cured.

208
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,830
Mr. Lu, I didn't steal your staff.

209
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,410
I recruited Ning Meng after she left Joint Capital.

210
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,680
Will you mind?

211
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,980
Why would I?

212
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,920
However, I must remind you.

213
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,670
You let a secretary do investment.

214
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,040
It's just like letting a trishaw cyclist drive a high-speed train.

215
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,035
You must be careful. Don't let her ruin things.

216
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,475
You're so humorous.

217
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:29,915
To be honest, a strong general doesn't have weak soldiers.

218
00:16:29,915 --> 00:16:33,265
Ning Meng is a good seedling you cultivated.

219
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:35,835
I'm lucky to have her.

220
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,765
That's fine.

221
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:40,515
Mr. Lu. Ms. Shi.

222
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,165
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

223
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,905
- Congratulations, Mr. Tang.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,165
I'm so happy that you came.

225
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:48,475
To be honest, we have our success today,

226
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,695
thanks to your help and support.

227
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:52,535
Thank you.

228
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,325
Mr. Tang, you're welcome.

229
00:16:54,325 --> 00:17:00,065
To be able to meet an entrepreneur with craftsmanship is our honor.

230
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:01,015
You flatter me.

231
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:04,745
Besides congratulating you, we're also here to hear your future plan.

232
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:06,435
I'm full of energy now.

233
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:10,115
With your support, I would like to do something great now.

234
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,385
Ms. Ning, go get Mr. Lu a glass of champagne.

235
00:17:13,385 --> 00:17:16,165
We'll talk while we drink. Okay?

236
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:22,255
Mr. Tang, Ning Meng is no longer Mr. Lu's secretary. I told you about it.

237
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,995
New secretary?

238
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm the one.

239
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:29,705
This is my temporary secretary.
<i>("temporary" pronounces as "dai")</i>

240

Ms. Dai? I get it.

241
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,785
Dai, we'll be in touch more.

242
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,165
Mr. Tang, my surname is Yang.

Xingyang?

244
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,065
Dai Xingyang is a good name.

245
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:48,215
Then, I shall get everyone champagne.

246
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:49,335
- Thank you.
- Let me take you there.

247
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,255
- This way.
- Okay.

248
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:55,345
Enjoy yourself. I have to work.

249
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,445
Okay. We'll help ourselves.

250
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,435
Sister Meng, what is this?

251
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:03,455
Without glasses, you're so stunning.

252
00:18:03,455 --> 00:18:04,545
You're a sweet talker.

253
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,375
I'm always sweet.

254
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,675
Sweet.

255
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,155
Let's go.

256
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,435

Mr. Lu.

Mr. Lu, try this. This is delicious.

260
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,185
All you do is eat.

261
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,595
Ms. Shi, do you want one?

262
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,255
Thank you.

263
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:37,655
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

264
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,345
<i>[Kirin Furniture Flagship Store Opening Cocktail Party]</i>
I'm not good with words.

265
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:42,325
I didn't want to be here, but they insisted.

266
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,705
I'm a craftsman.

267
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,585
All I know is to get work done.

268
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:52,685
Regarding capital operation and so on,

269
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,555
I'm a layman.

270
00:18:54,555 --> 00:18:59,725
Therefore, Kirin Furniture has today's success

271
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:02,905
thanks to this person alone.

272
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:06,785
He's Mr. Lu of Joint Capital.

273
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:08,985
Why did I say that?

274
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:15,255
Because besides providing us with strong financial support,

275
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,585
more importantly, he taught me

276
00:19:18,585 --> 00:19:20,205
how to make choices.

277
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:25,155
When immediate interests and long-term interests

278
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,485
are both available,

279
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,755
what choice should I make?

280
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:32,805
Because of this help,

00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:36,395
Kirin Furniture can be on the right track.

Who?

292
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:43,675
Regarding the matter of background research, I blamed you wrongly.

293
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,345
Weren't you angry?

294
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:49,935
I was too impulsive.

295
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:54,095
I already removed you from the blacklist.

296
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:56,965
Don't. It's good to be in there.

297
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,165
It's quiet.

298
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,615
Don't. You need the crowd sometimes.

299
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,835
You wronged me once and I wronged you once.

300

We're even.

301

Even? No way.

302

I would like to see what achievement can you make.

303
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:25,945
Here, look into the camera.

304

Three, two, one.

305
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:35,995
The prospect of Moody Lens is quite good.

306

They have a distinguished style.

307
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,925
I'm investing in this project.

308
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,745
What do you know about women's products?

309
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:46,075
I know more than you.

310
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:48,245
Tiantian helped me in researching.

311
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:53,585
Tiantian isn't useless.

312
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:57,275
Especially when it comes to cosmetics, she's very professional.

313
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,565
Speaking of the devil.

314
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:08,465
Ning Meng was also there?

315
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:10,525
Is the positioning wrong?

316
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,485
Why did she stand next to Shi Ying?

317
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,085
She went to Shi Ying's company?

318
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,135
Send me the financial report of Moody Lens.

319
00:22:20,485 --> 00:22:23,165
Does the lighting or the phone have a problem?

320
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:26,225
Why do you look so horrible?

321
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:30,085
There are three words on your face. I'll zoom in.

"Can't move on."

323

What can't move on?

324
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:36,645
What can't I move on from?

325

Lu Jiming, to be fair.

326
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:44,485
Your subordinate, Qiu Junlin, was quite despicable.

327
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:48,045
But it's not all his fault that Ning Meng left.

328
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:49,735
You're at fault, too.

329
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:53,695
Zeng Yuhang, is something wrong with your brain?

330
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,665
What fault do I have?

331
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,165
I was never wrong.

332
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:00,535
You're not wrong, I'm wrong.

333
00:23:03,685 --> 00:23:05,335
Hello?

334
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:07,505
<i>Ning Meng is really at Shi Ying's?</i>

335
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:10,215
<i>Did Mingming recommend her?</i>

336
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:14,825
Don't think too much. Why would Mingming find Ning Meng a job?

337
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,605
Oh no, he's mad.

338
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:20,405
I'm hanging up. If not, I may die.

339
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,625
Who was it? Xu Sitian?

340
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,295
Who else?

341
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:27,595
She's never serious.

342
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:30,075
She only cares about petty things.

343
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:32,255
Don't be mean to everyone.

344
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:36,135
Tiantian hasn't forgiven you regarding the scolding last time.

345
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:40,175
My 30th birthday is next week.

346
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,545
I'll give you a way out.

347
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,915
- Let's see.
- No "let's see," let's do it.

348
00:23:44,915 --> 00:23:47,205
Leave it. Are you blind?

349
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,985
- This is my glass.
- Let's do it. Cheers.

350

<i>Ning.</i>

351
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:01,155
Coming! Hold on.

352
00:24:01,995 --> 00:24:03,685
- Ning.
- Madam.

353
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,095
Are you busy?

354
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,555
It's okay.

355
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:08,415
Have some fruits.

356
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,325
Thank you so much.

357
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,195
Why are you here?

358
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:16,335
The lease on this house expires in two months, right?

359
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:19,225
I'll renew.

360
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,895
Have a seat.

361
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,255
I can't rent it to you.

362
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,025
I just sold this house.

363
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:28,895
The new owner wants to live here.

364
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,855
You sold it?

365
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:33,225
But no one came for a sighting.

366
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:35,735
Ning, you may not know.

367
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:39,405
The district school of this area is a laboratory school.

368
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,245
This house is within the school area.

369
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:44,775
Besides, this is a one-bedroom house.

370
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,345
Small and affordable.

371
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:48,045
It's very popular in the market.

372
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:50,805
No sighting is required. It's sold as soon as I listed it.

373
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:55,525
I know it's a little rushed.

374
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,675
But the market is good.

375
00:24:57,675 --> 00:24:59,465
You should understand me.

376
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:03,465
Yes.

377
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:05,595
Okay, then I...

378
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:09,085
I'll look for a new place.

379
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:10,265
Then hurry up.

380
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:13,405
- Please empty the house in the next two days.
- I have to move out in two days?

381
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:16,315
I've done the transfer procedure.

382
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,805
They're waiting to move here.

383
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:20,885
Please understand. Pack up quickly, okay?

384
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:21,965
Don't worry.

385
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:25,855
I'll return all the extra rent you paid.

386
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:28,705
It's decided. I shall leave now.

387
00:25:30,565 --> 00:25:32,185
All right, don't forget to eat the bananas.

388
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,065
They'll rot over time.

389
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,585
Don't see me off.

This is the industry data report I did.

392
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:12,005
As you see, the demand for intelligent conference equipment is increasing.

393
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,045

Sorry.

397
00:26:21,855 --> 00:26:25,845
Mobile video conference is becoming the norm.

398
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,825
The equipment we're researching

399
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:30,915
is an independent product rather than a part.

400
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:33,335
At the same time, they target the enterprise market.

401
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:36,015
Big clients don't care so much about prices.

Excuse me.

404
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,755
Here's the thing. This product is mainly for the enterprise market.

405
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:51,705
For example conglomerates and multinational companies.

406
00:26:51,705 --> 00:26:55,945
They don't care about prices. Hence, the product has a higher profit margin.

407
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:00,895
Okay.

408
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:06,415
Please follow up on the development of these projects.

Okay. That's all for today's meeting.

Okay. Thank you, Ms. Shi.

411
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:15,585
Ning Meng, please come to my office.

412
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,075
<i>[To Li from Rental Agency: Sorry, I'm in a meeting.]</i>

413
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:31,945
Ning Meng, you've been here for over a month. Right?

414
00:27:32,565 --> 00:27:37,645
You should be familiar with helping Tang Ya.

415
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:40,705
It's time for you to handle your job.

416
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:49,855
I got to know the owner of Cozap yesterday at Kirin Furniture's cocktail party.

417
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,165
I've inquired.

418
00:27:51,165 --> 00:27:55,735
They're a trending national chain of home furniture stores.

419
00:27:55,735 --> 00:27:58,385
All the data looks good.

420
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:03,615
I want you to do some research to see if it's worth investing in.

421
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,455
Ms. Shi, you want me to be in charge of this?

422
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:07,965
Yes.

423
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:11,655
Didn't you do this in Joint Capital before?

424
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,825
I believe you can do it.

425
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,485
Although I know a little,

426
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:22,105
I don't know how to make decisions on projects.

427
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:24,475
After all, I was working as a secretary.

428
00:28:24,475 --> 00:28:26,325
I'm afraid...

429
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:31,495
Ning Meng, did you realize

430
00:28:31,495 --> 00:28:34,925
that Mr. Lu likes to mention that you're a secretary?

431
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,335
You also like to mention it.

432
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,135
Secretary is your past.

433
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:43,675
You're at another stage now.

434
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:48,725
Do you believe in my taste?

435
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:53,245
If you trust me, you should trust yourself.

436
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:57,065
I want you to remove and forget

437
00:28:57,065 --> 00:28:58,995
the label of "secretary."

438
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:01,215
Say goodbye to Secretary Ning Meng.

439
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:07,315
Investor Ning Meng.

440
00:29:07,925 --> 00:29:09,405
Hello.

441
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:10,935
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

442
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,705
I'll work hard.

443
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,015
Don't stress yourself.

444
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:16,815
You're in charge of finding the problem.

445
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:19,115
I'll make the final decision.

446
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:22,025
We're short of time for this project.

447
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:25,175
They're in trend now. Many VCs think highly of them.

448
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:29,775
Hence no matter whether we invest or not, I wish to have a decision quickly to get the first chance.

449
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:32,885
I get it. Thank you, Ms. Shi.

450
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:35,955
I'm sorry. I have work to do tonight.

451
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:39,655
I can't go for a viewing. Let's do it another time.

452
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,675
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:52,345
Ning Meng, I'm leaving. Bye.

454
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,905
Bye.

455
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:05,355
Hello, Madam.

456
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,945
<i>Ning, what's going on?</i>

457
00:30:06,945 --> 00:30:09,445
<i>You said you'd move, but why haven't you done anything?</i>

458
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:13,075
I'm sorry. I've been very busy.

459
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,025
I'll move out tomorrow.

460
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:16,825
<i>But you haven't packed anything?</i>

461
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,495
<i>You bought the big wardrobe.</i>

462
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:21,125
<i>You have to take it with you when you move out.</i>

463
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:23,645
You went into my house?

464
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:25,215
<i>The new owner wants to see the house.</i>

465
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:28,085
<i>I couldn't reach you and you weren't home.</i>

466
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,485
<i>What was wrong with you?</i>

467
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:31,415
When did you call me?

468
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,725
Besides, you went into my house without my permission.

469
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:36,805
That's inappropriate although you're the landlady.

470
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,645
<i>Didn't I say I'll compensate?</i>

471
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,455
Don't talk about the compensation.

472
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:43,385
You broke the contract first. You should compensate for the rental.

473
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,165
It's written on the contract.

474
00:30:45,165 --> 00:30:48,435
I'll move out tomorrow. Please leave my house right now.

475
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:50,025
<i>Okay.</i>

476
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,335
What's going on?

477
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:55,145
Ms. Shi.

478
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,155
Nothing. It's about my rented house.

479
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:02,795
By the way, Ms. Shi, may I take a day's leave tomorrow?

480
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:04,395
I know the current project is urgent.

481
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:07,385
I'll just take half a leave off to move.

482
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:10,275
You found a new house?

483
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:11,935
I'm still looking.

484
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:16,055
There are things in life that you can make do.

485
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:20,045
But eating and living shouldn't be sloppy,

486
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,245
especially for a girl.

487
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:23,995
What about this?

488
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:27,235
Leave your work for now and come with me.

489
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,935
Where are we going?

490
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
This way.

491
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,300
Hello. Housekeeper?

492
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,000
May I know the default password for the apartment in Xuhui District?

493
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,100
Okay, thank you.

494
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,900
Come in.

495
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,500
It's got everything.

496
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
How's it?

497
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Does it match your taste?

498
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,200
This is great.

499
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,400
But I think the price is just as great.

500
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,100
The rental is negotiable.

501
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,500
Just talk to the landlady.

502
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
Talk to the landlady.

503
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,200
Ms. Shi, this is your apartment?

504
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
When I was working as Sponsor Representative,

505
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,400
I helped this company get listed.

506
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,500
The director gave me a discounted price.

507
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,900
But I haven't had a look here.

508
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,800
You don't need anything. Just move in with your belongings.

509
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,100
Besides, it's close to the office.

510
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,700
I'll give you a staff discount on the rental,

511
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,100
what do you think?

512
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,500
How can it be?

513
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,700
I'm new in the company and haven't contributed much.

514
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,400
How can I take advantage of you?

515
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,900
You heard quite anxious on the phone.

516
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,400
Besides, I don't want your work to be held up by the move.

517
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,900
Settle yourself well,

518
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,400
so you can get other things done.

519
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Actually, I'm just like you.

520
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,900
I'm not a local here.

521
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,600
When I just came to Shanghai,

522
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,400
I also rented a house.

523
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,500
When things broke down,

524
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,700
the landlord didn't repair them.

525
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,400
I've faced all these.

526
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,800
Yes, it's the same with my house.

527
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,200
The wall grew mold because of the moist, rainy days.

528
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,000
Not only did my landlady not fix it,

529
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,700
but she also blamed me for the damage. How irritating.

530
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
That's why I understand you.

531
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,900
I just want to help you out.

532
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,300
Don't feel pressured.

533
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
In fact, if you work well,

534
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,300
the profits you'll bring are way more than the rental here.

535
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,000
The benefits come from the paid price after all.

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,900
- What?
- No. I'm sorry. I used the wrong words.

537
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,300
It should be...

538
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,500
From the investment point of view, it's called a win-win.

539
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,500
Others are working hard, so who are you to give up?

540
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,100
Mr. Lu.

541
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,600
Mr. Lu.

542
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,100
We're home.

543
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,300
Are you sober?

544
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Why don't I send you in?

545
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,900
Mr. Lu.

546
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,000
What are you doing?

547
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,800
Mr. Lu, you like to be hygienic.

548
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,700
I don't want to dirty your house.

549
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,200
What's wrong with you?

550
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
I'll stop then. Come on.

551
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
You touch me after touching your feet.

552
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,700
Disgusting.

553
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,400
They don't stink.

554
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,900
Mr. Lu, are we going to Mr. Zeng's villa or the apartment in Xuhui District?

555
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,100
Apartment.

556
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
Okay.

557
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,200
I'm almost there.

558
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
<i>I'm going to say this again.</i>

559
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,900
<i>Take advantage of my birthday's atmosphere to reconcile with Tiantian.</i>

560
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,600
<i>Do it for me. Stop playing more tricks.</i>

561
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,400
My attendance is all for your and her sake.

562
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,400
You're late as usual.

563
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
Here, come in.

564
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,300
Why is no one here?

565
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,100
Am I not someone?

566
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,300
I'm trying to give you the opportunity.

567
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,900
Do something.

568
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
No rush.

569
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,700
For you.

570
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,700
What is this?

571
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,500
This is a good year for whiskey.

572
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,200
Do you remember the 25-year-old Oak Whiskey

573
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,400
I gave you on your company's opening?

574
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,100
- Was it good?
- I don't know.

575
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,000
We'll find out later.

576
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,600
This is the one I gave you?

577
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
It's not the same.

578
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
The one you gave me is 25 years old.

579
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,700
This one is 30 years old, limited edition.

580
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,600
What kind of person are you?

581
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
I kept this bottle for five years

582
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,500
and I'm loathed to drink it.

583
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,900
Today, I'm sharing it with you,

584
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,100
yet you're not content.

585
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,900
Look how nice I am to you.

586
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,500
Tiantian said my singing is bad and embarrassing in public.

587
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,600
So she gave me a karaoke system.

588
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
How was it? Isn't nice?

589
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
Tiantian is singing.

590
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I was wondering where this beautiful singing came from.

591
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,100
Turns out it is Tiantian.

592
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,500
Was it good, Mingming?

593
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,700
Mingming.

594
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,100
I haven't sung.

595
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,000
That's not necessary.

596
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,200
The quality is obvious enough.

597
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,500
Others may not know, but the two of us do.

598
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,300
The high quality of Tiantian is there for all to see.

599
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,200
Right, Mingming?

600
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,400
What merits does Tiantian have?

601
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,800
She's quite pretty.

602
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,900
Yes. What else?

603
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
And inner beauty, right?

604
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,600
She's also smart.

605
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,400
And a mind of her own.

606
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,000
Since when do you talk with your nose?

607
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Stop annoying me. I want to sing.

608
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm answering a call.

609
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,100
I have something regarding digital commercialization to talk to him.

610
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,500
- Come with me.
- Okay.

611
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
<i>I'll make a time with Yang Xiaoyang.</i>

612
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,800
Okay.

613
