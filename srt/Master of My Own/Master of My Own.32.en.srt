<i>[Episode 32]</i>

3
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,530
Also, You Qi's birthday. You didn't go purposely.

4
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,950
You were afraid that I'd discover you were colluding with them.

5
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,260
I didn't want to join them at first.

6
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,190
I rejected He Yueluan.

7
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,130
He turned around and got Jin Haiyang instead.

8
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,300
I look down on these people

9
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,360
because my opponents are people like Lu Jiming.

10
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,960
I didn't want to get involved with his father, either.

11
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,160
But slowly, I lost control...

12
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,520
because I realized...

13
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,570
you were still thinking of him subconsciously

14
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,880
when you were with me.

15
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,430
I knew you had been controlling yourself

16
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,620
to keep a distance from him.

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,980
But the more effort you put in,

18
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,630
the more I hated him.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,900
Don't worry.

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,780
I won't hurt you anymore.

21
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,670
My worst mistake...

22
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,910
was to hit you that day.

23
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,130
Senior.

24
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,620
Do you know what hurts me the most?

25
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,210
It's the fact that you looked down on He Yueluan and the rest,

26
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,390
but you still did those bad things...

27
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,780
and those illegal things with them.

28
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,520
You are splitting yourself into another person.

29
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,460
Ning Meng, do you still remember...

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,390
what I told you at the lecture hall?

31
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,640
They were all true.

32
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,570
Sometimes, I would even think...

33
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,000
we would be very much in love

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,110
if we started a relationship...

35
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,720
when we were in university.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,620
We would have had many achievements.

37
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,480
Positive achievements.

38
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,550
If we could have met each other earlier,

39
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,270
you would stop me.

40
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,200
And many things wouldn't have happened.

41
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,000
I wouldn't have become another person.

42
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,910
The person who can save you is not me...

43
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,000
but yourself.

44
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,860
Look.

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,600
You want to change.

46
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,510
There has always been a good self

47
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,060
and a bad self fighting in you.

48
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,290
Your bad self won previously.

49
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,990
Now, it's time for your good self to win.

50
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,080
Go and turn yourself in.

51
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,650
Although accepting punishment

52
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,860
requires courage and might be suffering,

53
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,640
it is also a rebirth.

54
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,200
You are not Jason.

55
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,480
You are your own self.

56
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,830
You are Su Weiran.

57
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,110
You may leave now.

58
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,550
How was it?

59
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,760
He will make a choice.

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
Let's go.

61
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Turn. Turn it around.

62
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,390
Huge corner.

63
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,390
Song. Please stop using jargon.

64
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,600
Can you tell me why you are interested in the investment industry?

65
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,490
Mr. Liu, your coffee.

66
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,300
Investing has been a thing I wanted to do since high school...

67
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,130
Ms. Ning, your coffee.

68
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,370
Thank you.

69
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,930
You're welcome.

70
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,000
Mr. Lu, your coffee.

71
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,810
Mr. Liang invested 20%.

72
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,480
Mr. Lin and Mr. Liu invested 18% together.

73
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,910
In total, it's 38%.

74
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,040
Tang Zhengwang has requested 7% from me.

75
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,980
The total with our shares and some from our minor Limited Partners,

76
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,520
it's just enough.

77
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,030
That's great. We have finally gathered enough plates.

78
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,710
It's time to serve the dishes.

79
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,910
Thank you, Ms. Ning. Thank you, Mr. Lu.

80
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,840
Thanks to Lu Meng for investing in us.

81
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
With both your support,

82
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,760
I feel our intelligent community project

83
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,240
will definitely bring about good development to the city welfare.

84
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,440
We are the ones who need to thank Ms. Huang for your trust.

85
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,030
We will definitely do our best.

86
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,380
I am really touched

87
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,480
because I've contacted many investors.

88
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
The feeling they gave me

89
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
was to have fun with the concept instead of execution.

90
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,650
Today, at L&M Capital, in front of both of you,

91
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,760
I really have the confidence to execute it well.

92
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,720
I hope we can keep working together in the next ten years.

93
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,150
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Ning. Thank you.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,700
I have a meeting in the afternoon. I'll be leaving.

96
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,070
- Sure. Let me send you off.
- All right.

97
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,590
Next Tuesday is our community's ground-breaking ceremony.

98
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,220
I really hope both of you can attend.

99
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,790
- Of course. All right?
- For sure. All right.

100
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,610
Please stay here. Let's meet again on Tuesday.

101
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,070
All right. Ms. Huang. Take care.

102
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,300
- See you later, Ms. Huang.
- Goodbye.

103
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,760
It's finally done.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,430
Let's do a high five, my friend.

105
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,200
You hit hard.

106
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,030
My training didn't go to waste when I was your secretary.

107
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,350
Hello.

108
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,080
Yes. Speaking.

109
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,780
All right. I'll go there later.

110
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,350
What is it?

111
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Su Weiran turned himself in.

112
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:30,470
His good self finally won against his bad self.

166
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,940
Thanks for not giving up.

167
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,710
Are you free next week?

168
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,950
- What is it?
- I spoke to Yuan Jie.

169
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,540
I should visit Phoenix Industry Samples again.

170
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,370
I think we can work together this time.

171
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,550
Yuan Jie is working well with Mr. Tang, right?

172
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,100
How did you know?

173
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,300
- You introduced them?
- Yes.

174
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,610
Am I a good matchmaker?

175
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,050
It's wonderful to have you, my friend.

176
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:31,530
My friend. What you said makes me cringe.

177
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,920
I remember when I was your secretary,

178
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,850
I always felt I was miles apart from you.

179
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,580
I didn't expect us to be good friends.

180
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:55,490
That's because you always dared to do things

181
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,300
and never gave up on your dreams.

182
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,630
Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a capable you

183
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:05,700
and the me who stood up again because of your motivation.

184
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,730
Ning Meng.

185
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,950
There's something...

186
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,130
that I have wanted to say for a long time.

187
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,650
I think we can...

188
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,810
we can expand the intelligent community and make it better.

189
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,740
Yes. Expand and make it better.

190
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,830
Yes. Higher, bigger, better.

<i>[Enforce Strictly, Serve Passionately]</i>

192
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,870
I didn't expect you to come and visit me.

193
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,750
You look well.

194
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,480
You don't look too well.

195
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,120
How can I look well here?

196
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,620
No one forced you initially.

197
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,100
You pushed yourself to this place.

198
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,420
Let's not talk about me.

199
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,440
You have to take good care of yourself when you're alone in the future.

200
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,400
Don't simply spend your salary.

201
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,720
Don't buy anything you see.

202
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,710
Learn to manage your finances from Ning Meng.

203
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,620
Who are you to say that to me?

204
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,090
Sorry.

205
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,410
I came here today not to hear your useless apology.

206
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,150
I know.

207
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,940
You are here to laugh at me.

208
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,700
This will be our last meeting.

209
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,160
Every day in the future,

210
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,080
I will work hard to give myself a better life.

211
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,770
I will have my own life and career.

212
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,250
You woke me up.

213
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,480
Thankfully, it's still not too late.

214
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,980
Have you seen your child?

215
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,850
I saw the picture.

216
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,000
He's a fat kid. Strong and honest.

217
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,840
Looks just like me when I was young.

218
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,720
What is it?

219
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,540
It's nothing.

220
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,870
I wish you happiness.

221
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,230
Let's go.

222
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,900
Did you see him?

223
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,980
Did you tell him about the child?

224
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,120
Forget it. It's meaningless.

225
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,180
This person is no longer important to me.

226
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Looks like you've moved on.

227
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,460
Looking at it now, it's not all bad.

228
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,340
I've grown up at least.

229
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,310
It's not bad.

230
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,450
Something like that should be found out by himself.

231
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,500
Let him have some expectations.

232
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,460
He deserves it.

233
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,881
I feel hungry. Let's eat something good.

234
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,930
- Let's go.
- We'll have a feast.

235
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,090
What do you want to eat?

236
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,080
Seafood.

237
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,760
Peel your own prawns.

238
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,620
I know.

239
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,940
Ning Meng, there's something I've wanted to say for a long time.

240
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,310
You don't know.

241
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,610
No.

242
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,880
I think you've known it.

243
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,180
No.

244
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,880
Actually, I don't know whether you know it or not.

245
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,290
Ning Meng, all these years,

246
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,960
we've argued.

247
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,030
We missed each other.

248
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,730
We also accompanied each other and grew up a lot.

249
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,860
We could understand each other without saying what's on our minds out loud,

250
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,790
but there's one thing that I still want to tell you.

251
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,810
I like...

252
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,240
You...

253
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,510
Hello.

254
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,930
Are you going out?

255
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,430
No. I'm staying at home.

256
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,940
Come in.

257
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,430
You are all dressed up for someone staying at home.

258
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,940
I just bought this suit. I was trying it.

259
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,420
You're only trying the top half?

260
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,040
Well, you knocked.

261
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,480
I've yet to try the pants.

262
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,060
Are you free tomorrow?

263
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,470
Yes.

264
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,420
I'll see you at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow at the office.

265
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,060
There's a surprise.

266
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,300
What surprise?

267
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,900
It wouldn't be a surprise if I told you.

268
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,570
You look good. Remember to wear the pants tomorrow.

269
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,030
This one.

270
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,860
This is too much.

271
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,840
This.

272
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,070
This is too mature.

273
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,890
This one.

274
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,130
It's mature and also playful.

275
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,580
It's very energetic.

276
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,570
Won't this be too much?

277
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,700
Mengmeng, it's your big day.

278
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,980
You have to be the prettiest.

279
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,510
This one it is.

280
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,310
Fine. I'll listen to you.

- What are you doing?

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,200
Mr. Lu, today is the first anniversary of L&M Capital's establishment.

284
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,710
- Have you forgotten?
- Hurry. Let's go.

- Take a look.
- Look.

Ms. Ning, you are not good at keeping secrets.

287
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,800
Mr. Lu came here prepared.

288
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,990
99 roses?

289
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,870
The bouquet looks like it's for a specific person.

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,460
Stop talking nonsense.

291
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,030
Isn't it the anniversary?

292
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,480
This bouquet is for all the employees.

I love you too, Mr. Lu.

Xiaoyang, put the bouquet in the center.

297
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,060
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for your love.

Let go.

299
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,420
Mr. Lu, how did you know it was the anniversary?

300
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,950
I guessed it.

301
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,750
It's not surprising at all.

302
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,800
We really have an astute boss.

303
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,050
You better change astute to smart.

304
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,120
Yes.

305
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,300
Are we too early?

306
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,120

- Ms. Shi.
- Congratulations.

Ms. Ning. Mr. Lu.

309
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,300
- Hello, Ms. Shi.
- Congratulations.

310
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,440
Let me introduce.

311
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,160
This is my boyfriend, Jason.

312
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,970
Jason?

313
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,860
What's wrong?

314
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,140
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing.

315
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,550
Jason is working at a Singaporean fund company.

316
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

317
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,610
- Please come in.
- Okay.

318
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,900
- Take their flowers.
- Just give it to me.

319
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,420
- Ning Meng.
- Ya.

320
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,350
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

321
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,480
- Did you see Ms. Shi's boyfriend?
- I did.

322
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,880
He is so handsome. He's my idol indeed.

323
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,870
I have to learn from her later.

324
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,670
Sure. Go in quickly.

325
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,830
Xiaoyang.

326
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,900
Ms. Ning.

327
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,400
What a lively atmosphere today.

Ms. Ning.

329
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,980
Congratulations.

330
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,430
- Tang.
- It's both of your big days today.

331
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,060
I brought a bottle of good wine.

332
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,050
We have to liven it up.

333
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,920
- Thank you.
- What you said can mean many things.

334
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,730
It's Lu Meng's big day.

335
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,750
They are the same.

336
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,030
Mr. Lin went abroad for work.

337
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,880
- He asked me to bring you flowers.
- Thank you.

338
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,620
- Receive the things.
- Xiaoyang. Receive it.

339
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,930
- Open the wine.
- Sure.

340
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,480
- Please come in.
- Do you have any food?

341
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,210
Of course.

342
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,920
Mr. Lu. Ms. Ning.

343
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,550
- Mr. Yuan.
- Mr. Yuan.

344
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,860
You've lost weight.

345
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,690
Champagne roses. Let's talk later.

346
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,180
- I'm going in first. I'm going in first.
- Sure.

347
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,560
I have some secrets to tell you.

348
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,750
Sorry for pouring it on your flowers.

349
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,580
It's fine.

350
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,010
But they are literally champagne roses now.

351
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,630
Yes. Champagne and roses.

352
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,730
I am Ning Meng's bestie, You Qi.

353
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,360
Hello, I am Yuan Jie.

354
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,060
Mr. Zeng.

355
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,900
Ning Meng.

356
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,460
- How is it?
- It's big enough.

357
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,440
Look who I brought.

358
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,420
Madam Liu.

359
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,260
How are you recently, Madam Liu?

360
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm fine. I just feel lonely.

361
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,170
Well, does your company need a female secretary?

362
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,020
Madam, you'll become an administrative consultant at least.

363
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,490
Come in.

364
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,700
- We'll be going in first.
- Please come in.
- Madam Liu, please.

365
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,700
Everyone's here, right?

366
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,450
We may begin.

367
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

368
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,560
Esteemed guests.

369
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,310
Dear friends.

370
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,370
Welcome to Lu Meng's first anniversary.

371
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,930
This year is a year where heroes ally together.

372
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,720
Ms. Ning's banner is well-written.

373
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,450
"Smooth sailing in the past year.

374
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,460
Still a long way to go for Lu Meng."

375
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,920
Nice!

376
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,910
On this very memorable day, please allow me to say a few words.

377
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,820
Why are you speaking?

378
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,700
Let's invite Mr. Lu and Ms. Ning to say a few words.

379
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,600
- I... I'll speak later.
- Give a speech.

380
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,690
You first.

381
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,770
All right.

382
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm sure all of you present here

383
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,290
know my situation well.

384
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,950
I've been in the capital market for so many years.

385
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,290
I've experienced love and hate.

386
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,690
I was deeply betrayed and I was deeply touched.

387
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,230
I'm grateful to have all of you with us.

388
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,440
Especially you, Ning Meng.

389
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,580
You were my secretary.

390
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,350
I was guiding you.

391
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,170
Now, you are the one who guides me.

392
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,680
Thank you, everyone.

393
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,540
I hope we will always be together

394
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,770
on every Lu Meng's anniversary in the future.

395
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,940
- Thank you.
- Great!

396
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,050
It's your turn.

397
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,640
Good.

398
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,110
All these years, Mr. Lu has changed

399
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,560
from an irritable and inconsiderate Tyrannosaurus rex

400
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,060
into a stoic, warm...

401
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,780
- Little green dragon.
- Little white dragon.

402
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,010
Teddy bear.

403
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,300
Caterpillar.

404
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,820
All of you.

405
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,320
All these years, I've also slowly learned to become an investor

406
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,550
from a normal secretary.

407
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:35,040
Within this period, I've experienced a lot and faced various adversities.

408
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,700
The capital market is complicated.

409
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,870
There's justice and evil.

410
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,810
There are also good and bad people.

411
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,480
Meanwhile, money is a double-edged sword.

412
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,290
It can hurt or save a person.

413
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,400
Thankfully, in many difficult moments,

414
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,300
I didn't go against my original intention of working in this industry.

415
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,610
I also didn't overstep the bottom line.

416
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,200
Also, I never gave up.

417
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,630
I am also very lucky to meet many benefactors

418
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,650
and have many excellent projects and excellent partners.

419
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,170
All of you gave me opportunities to try things out and grow slowly.

420
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:16,450
Within this process, I received everyone's complete trust.

421
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,120
I gained precious friendships.

422
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,550
All of these are my greatest wealth.

423
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:32,360
If there's a no-risk investment project in this world

424
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,400
that won't make you regret forever,

425
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,150
I think it's your dream.

426
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,560
The road ahead is still long.

427
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,080
I want to tell myself

428
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,380
that no matter what I see or experience in the future,

429
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,670
I should not forget my original dream

430
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,220
and my original self.

431
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,120
I hope we get what we want and achieve our dreams.

432
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,010
Great!

433
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,020
Achieve our dreams!

434
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,180
- Let's go, Lu Meng!
- Let's go, Lu Meng!

435
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,750
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

436
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,230
- Let's go, Lu Meng.
- Let's go.

437
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
<i>[L&M Capital, Happy 1st Anniversary]</i>

438
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,260
<i>You can eat a bit. I'll help you take what you want.</i>

439
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,400
Ms. Ning.

440
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,850
Mr. Lu.

441
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,430
A toast to both of you.

442
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,110
Mr. Yuan.

443
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,910
Although you didn't invest in me back then,

444
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,350
you made me understand that rushing things will only make it worse.

445
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,800
It's all thanks to both of you that Phoenix Industry Samples

446
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,060
can be steady and grow further.

447
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,390
You're welcome.

448
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,810
The logic is easy, but executing it well is difficult.

449
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,410
Yes.

450
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:51,162
It's all thanks to Phoenix Industry Samples for the intelligent community's industrial chain to connect together.

451
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:53,490
We are very thankful to you, too.

452
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,800
Cheers. Wishing L&M Capital to be prosperous and booming

453
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,130
and the couple who is running the business to be happy.

454
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,000
Both of you are... not together yet?

455
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Sometimes, it may not be right to take big steps.

456
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
But your steps now are too small.

457
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,500
Mr. Zeng, long time no see.

458
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
<i>She's the one who always gives me this mask.</i>

459
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,700
Ning Meng.

460
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,100
Well...

461
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Since the atmosphere is good, I have something to say.

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Please be my witness.

463
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,000
All right. Say it.

464
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,400
Xiaoyang.

465
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,100
After so many years, I don't think I can hold it in anymore.

466
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I like you.

467
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
Let's be together.

468
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,300
<i>- Great.
- Great!</i>

469
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
Look how red Xiaoyang's face is.

470
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,200
This is because of the wine. Nonsense.

471
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,600
Hurry up.

472
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,500
Mr. Zeng, how can you say that to my goddess?

473
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,900
Xiaoyang,

474
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,600
I promise to let you sit in my side passenger seat.

475
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Give me a chance.

476
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll think about it.

477
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
I did it, Mr. Lu!

478
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,000
Song, you finally said it.

479
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm feeling anxious for you.

480
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,200
What do you mean?

481
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,200
- Didn't you realize that they have been very considerate towards each other?
- Give us a kiss!

482
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,500
<i>- Come on. Give us a kiss! Give us a kiss!</i>
- I realized it.

483
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,400
<i>Give us a kiss!</i>

484
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,000
- Great!
<i>- Give us a kiss!</i>

485
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Give us a kiss!

486
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
A relationship with mutual love is wonderful.

487
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
- Actually, I...
- Actually, I also have good news to announce to everyone.

488
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,000
Tiantian and I finally got married yesterday.

489
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,700
Thank you, everyone.

490
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,100
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

491
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,600
Congratulations. When is your wedding banquet?

492
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,800
My mom wants to choose an auspicious date.

493
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,700
We'll inform you when we've decided.

494
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,200
All right. Congratulations!

495
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
- Congratulations, Ms. Xu.
- Congratulations.

496
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Mr. Lu, what's the situation of the marriage money I invested?

497
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Don't worry. It's enough for you to raise a child now.

498
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
Cheers, my brother.

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,600
Well, what's... what's going on with you?

500
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,000
Will you be fine?

501
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
Why won't I be?

502
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,900
This situation makes me want to recite a poem.

503
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,500
- Come on.
- Show us.

504
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,600
The first anniversary of Lu Meng.

505
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Song and Yang become a couple.

506
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Mr. Zeng and Ms. Xu tied the knot.

507
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,700
Tied the knot...

508
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,300
If you have any more good news, announce it while it's hot.

509
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,400
Announce it.

510
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,800
- I...
- I'll make it four then.

511
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm preparing to expand my business to Singapore.

512
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,200
I'll leave Shanghai to you.

513
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,400
Ms. Shi, don't worry.

514
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
- Well, Shi Ying, everyone knows about this.
- Yes.

515
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
- Do you know that?
- We do.

516
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,600
This is not a surprise.

517
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,400
I welcome all of you to Singapore.

518
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,300
All three people in our family welcome you.

519
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,500
- Three people?
- Three people in your family?

520
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,800
This is a surprise!

521
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,400
Congratulations!

522
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
Come on.

523
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Congratulations!

524
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,400
Where are all of them?

525
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,600
There's a fireworks show today. All of them went to see the fireworks.

526
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,000
Why didn't you go?

527
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,100
I... I wanted to ask you if you were going.

528
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,400
Yes. I know a place with a very good view.

529
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

530
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
The view is quite good indeed.

531
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,000
It's so beautiful.

532
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,300
Yes. Very beautiful.

533
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,900
Ning Meng.

534
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,900
Let's be together.

535
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,800
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

536
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,000
I will never forget that day.

537
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,600
You threw caution to the wind and came back to help me.

538
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,600
I was very touched.

539
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,400
I wanted to tell you how I felt back then.

540
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,300
But I also know the timing wasn't right.

541
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,400
If you needed love to save you back then,

542
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,400
I think I might never fall for you again.

543
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,500
You have to stand up on your own.

544
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,800
The fact proves that you did it.

545
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,470
Your current self is more likable than your previous self.

546
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,200
So, you agreed?

547
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,800
That might be the case.

548
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,900
But I still want to hear you say it to me seriously.

549
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,700
Ning Meng.

550
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
You...

551
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,400
I...

552
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,600
I want to become your father's son-in-law.

553
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,500
May I kiss you?

554
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,000
Your question is really stupid.

555
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,500
Don't ask me questions like this in the future.

556

561
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
They wanted to have a look. I couldn't stop them.

562
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,400
See, I told you not to push. They discovered us now.

563
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,000
We are here to see the night view.

564
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
Today's weather...

565

Where are your manners?

566
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,400
What do you mean? Where are your manners?

567
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Mr. Lu, continue kissing. We won't interrupt you.

568
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
- Continue.
- We won't disturb you.

Well... We are passing by.

570
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,000
- Mr. Lu is shy, we should leave.
- Sure.

571
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,200
Mr. Lu, build up your emotions.

572
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,800
Dismissed, everyone.

573
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
- Let's go.
- All right.

574
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,580
Stand there.
