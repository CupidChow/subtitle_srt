00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,720
It was so jammed that I was afraid I couldn't pick you up on time.

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,630
Long time no see, Mingming.

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,600
Have you been well?

6
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,030
You know them?

7
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,030
Mengmeng?

8
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,390
My former boss.

9
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,460
You mean, that's your ex-boss, Mr. Lu?

10
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,170
Is that his girlfriend beside him?

11
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,560
They are a handsome pair.

12
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Wait.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,530
You said he's quite a terrible guy, right?

14
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,720
Now that's unfair.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,930
How could a person like him get a girlfriend?

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,870
Never mind that. Let's go get a taxi.

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,420
Make yourself at home.

18
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,750
The scenery here is pretty good.

19
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,100
It's not too bad.

20
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,010
And it's just like your style.

21
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,020
What's my style?

22
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,160
Black, white, gray.

23
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,570
I don't suppose you cook very often.

24
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,160
I don't have time to cook.

25
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,660
Anyway, do you want something to drink?

26
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,090
Coffee, please.

27
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,660
At this hour?

28
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,500
Won't that keep you awake?

29
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm used to it.

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
And I have jet lag.

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
I can't sleep at this hour even without coffee.

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,650
Okay, I'll make it for you.

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,670
Yimeng, hold on a second.

34
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,340
Didn't you use to call me Meng?

35
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,820
Why change?

36
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,880
That was way before.

37
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,960
The coffee machine doesn't seem to be working.

38
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,820
It's fine. I'm good with whatever.

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,960
It was a long flight.

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,510
I'm going to get changed.

41
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,750
Okay, go ahead.

42
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,670
I'll figure this out.

43
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,850
Is this the one?

44
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,890
Yes, thanks.

45
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,180
Mengmeng, your house is so nice.

46
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,850
The furnishings and home appliances are pretty high-end.

47
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,900
How much is the monthly rent?

48
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,650
Perhaps He and I should rent a place here, too.

49
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,620
I don't think you'd be able to get the same price.

50
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,270
Because this is my boss' house.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,720
She rented it to me at a discount.

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,080
Really?

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,770
Sounds like your boss treats you well.

54
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,470
Hello?

55
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,870
<i>Hey, Ning Meng.</i>

56
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,320
How do you use the coffee machine?

57
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,310
<i>The one you helped me buy?</i>

58
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,980
I thought you didn't drink coffee at night.

59
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm hosting a friend.

60
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,370
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

61
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,690
Yes, I'm listening.

62
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,810
The manual for the machine is in one of the kitchen drawers.

63
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,350
Just follow the instructions.

64
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,360
Drawer? There are so many drawers. I can't find it.

65
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,890
Just tell me how you made the one for me before.

66
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,050
That was a pour-over coffee. It wasn't made with a machine.

67
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,580
Pour... Pour-over coffee?

68
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,460
How am I supposed to do this?

69
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,300
Listen, stay on the line.

70
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,110
Tell me slowly. Step by step.

71
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,770
Rinse the filter with boiling water.

72
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,820
And then?

73
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,370
Heat the coffee pot.

74
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,320
Then pour the coffee powder evenly on the top.

75
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,570
On the first pour, let it steep for a bit.

76
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,550
Let the water extract its fragrance.

77
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,600
Pour another two or three times.

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,720
Do it slowly in a clockwise direction.

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,670
It takes a bit of patience.

80
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,190
<i>Sounds like a lot of work.</i>

81
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,090
<i>Can't I just pour it directly?</i>

82
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,170
Mr. Lu, if you're in a hurry, just drink instant coffee.

83
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay, I got it.

84
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,140
Thanks.

85
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,270

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,600
I can see the lifting effect.

90
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,260

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,260
<i>Found it. Thanks.</i>

95
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:21,100
Mengmeng, who was that calling you again and again at night?

96
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,300
A colleague.

97
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,440
A male colleague? Female?

98
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,520
None of your business.

99
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,660
Being here, it feels like we're back to our college days.

100
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,870
That's true.

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,370
Here.

102
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,750
Do you remember?

103
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,690
One time, I spilled milk tea all over my comforter

104
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,670
and had to squeeze with you on one bed.

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,640
You're one to talk.

106
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,020
There was no shortage of those incidents.

107
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,040
One time, you had a fight with He and got yourself drunk.

108
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,030
You vomited all over your bed.

109
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,330
You also squeezed on my bed that night.

110
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,370
- Do you remember?
- Okay, okay!

111
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,690
That night, you kept tossing around and grinding your teeth, scolding in your sleep.

112
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,830
I couldn't sleep a wink.

113
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,160
Try this.

114
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,700
It's my first time making it.

115
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,100
I don't know if it's any good.

116
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,720
Your first time?

117
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,300
Let me taste it.

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,370
How is it?

119
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,620
It's pretty fragrant.

120
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,040
Really?

121
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,920
Don't drink it. I'll buy you one.

122
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,790
It's okay. It's been a long day for you, too.

123
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,770
I'll go and get the room ready for you then.

124
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,300
Look how clumsy you are.

125
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,380
I'll do it.

126
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,140
Let me.

127
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,300

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,990
I haven't been sleeping well.

131
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,670
It's nothing. Don't worry.

132
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,670
Ms. Shi, this is the research report for Mobi. Take a look.

133
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,480
That was quick.

134
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,990
Does Mr. Lu know about this project?

135
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,800
He doesn't.

136
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,480
Why don't you ask him if he's interested in investing?

137
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,870
From what I know, this sector isn't in Mr. Lu's investment field.

138
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,440
When I was at Joint Capital,

139
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
Mr. Lu had rejected similar fitness projects.

140
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,680
Saying no before doesn't mean it's a no forever.

141
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,050
Besides, he thinks highly of you.

142
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,910
Who knows, he might be interested in your project?

143
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,120
Ms. Shi, to be honest, we have the capabilities to be a sole-limited partner.

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,980
As such, Eaglestone will have more say in the project.

145
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,770
There is no need to have Mr. Lu be a joint GP with us.

146
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,310
Mr. Lu has a lot of experience.

147
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,140
Even if he's not investing, it's good to get his opinions.

148
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,450
Have a chat with him.

149
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,300
Promote the idea a bit.

150
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,060
Is that too big an ask?

151

- Thank you.

167
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,080
Sister Meng, that's a really interesting ring you have there.

168
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,470
Is it a foreign designer brand?

169
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,650
The Chinese designer is a friend of mine.

170
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,960
If you like it, I can give you her contact.

171
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,320
That would be awesome. Thanks, Meng.

172
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Meng, how long will you be staying this time?

173
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,850
I'm not sure. But I'm planning to stay longer.

174
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,850
Yes, stay longer.

175
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,620
I think you could come back and work.

176
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,540
These past years, the local contemporary art market has been booming.

177
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,630
Besides, nowhere else is as vibrant as China. Right?

178
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,300
Stop talking nonsense.

179
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,520
Meng has lived overseas for a long time.

180
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,010
She's pretty much settled down there.

181
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,410
It's not that easy to uproot everything.

182
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,430
Am I right, Meng?

183
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,180
Meng, when are you and your boyfriend planning to get married?

184
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,530
I heard it from Mingming.

185
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,710
Do you have pictures? I want to see them.

186
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,040
I'd like to see what kind of man managed to woo such a goddess.

187
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,060
You're awfully nosy. Eat your food.

188
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,420
Here, eat the fish.

189
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,080
Thanks.

190
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,490
Actually, coming back to work is not that bad of an option.

191
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,580
Moreover, these past years, China's market for contemporary art is indeed getting better.

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,160
China's level of commercialization is also quite high.

193
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,880
I have a friend who does art collections.

194
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,920
He's doing pretty good. I'm planning to invest in it.

195
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,490
Don't simply invest.

196
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,640
If you like something, just buy it.

197
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,940
You can hang it up at home, right?

198
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,070
Zeng Yuhang, who was it that said he'd support my career unconditionally?

199
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,480
Yes, I support you.

200
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,400
You should learn a thing or two from Meng while she's back.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,530
Work on your skills.

202
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,400
That's more like it.

203
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,860
Are you two...

204
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,500
Didn't Mingming tell you?

205
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,820
They have the same stench.

206
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,470
So they're together.

207
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,080
What same stench?

208
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,710
He and his poker face? He stinks the most.

209
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,000
Before I went overseas, I had thought you two made a great match.

210
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,630
And you've been friends since young. You could say you're childhood sweethearts.

211
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,280
Indeed. Fate played a cruel joke.

212
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,180
She always made me play house with her when we were kids.

213
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,230
Who knew we'd really end up together?

214
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,520
Come, let me congratulate you two.

215
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,670
May your love grow ever fonder.

216
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,080
Thanks.

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,520
Here.

218
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,330
This is the advantage of growing up together.

219
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,540
You're more at ease because you know the other person.

220
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,440
Meng, you grew up with Mingming since young, too. Right?

221
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,790
You may not know this, Meng.

222
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,690
Hanghang told me that ever since you went abroad,

223
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,960
Mingming had spent his days...

224
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,240
Here, eat this. Eat this, quick.

225
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,430
How did he spend his days?

226
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,960
He... He matured a lot.

227
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,450
Yes.

228
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,770
- I need the restroom.
- Okay.

229
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,100
Me too. I need to fix my makeup.

230
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,680
Send Tiantian a message.

231
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,510
Tell her not to talk nonsense.

232
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,870
Don't worry. They're going to fix their makeup.

233
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,340
They won't talk about anything else but makeup.

234
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,010
Look at you. You're always bossing us like the alpha wolf.

235
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,150
But in front of Meng, you're like a docile lamb.

236
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,940
Just zip it.

237
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,840
These dishes don't seem to suit Meng's taste.

238
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,860
Should we order something else?

239
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,270
I don't think that's the problem.

240
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,370
Could it be the jet lag? So she's unwell?

241
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,620
I think something's off.

242
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,070
Do you want me to find out for you?

243
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,740
My friend in the States can help.

244
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,110
Okay.

245
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,450
- Xiaoyang.
<i>- Ning Meng.</i>

246
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,710
I wanted to know. Is Mr. Lu busy lately?

247
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,420
<i>What's up?</i>

248
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,600
I have a project that I'd like to talk to him about.

249
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,420
I sent him the proposal but he hasn't replied.

250
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,790
<i>Mr. Lu has been kind of weird these days.</i>

251
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,090
<i>He just checks in at the office each day and leaves right after.</i>

252
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,580
<i>Whoever wishes to see him has to make an appointment beforehand.</i>

253
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,550
Is Mr. Lu busy with a new project?

254
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,240
<i>I don't think so.</i>

255
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,870
<i>What kind of project would need him to personally run errands?</i>

256
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,900
<i>Do you think Mr. Lu is up to something?</i>

257
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,810
Like what?

258
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,260
<i>Forget it.</i>

259
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>Mr. Lu isn't some romantic idiot.</i>

260
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,870
Xiaoyang, this matter is quite urgent.

261
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,550
Just help me set a time with him.

262
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,250
I'll talk to him. The sooner the better.

263
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,660
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

264
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,610
Xiaoyang.

265
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,730
Sister Ning Meng, he's waiting for you inside.

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,430
Mr. Lu.

267
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,920
Sit.

268
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,320
Here's the thing. Ms. Shi wants me to come to talk to you about a new project we've gotten.

269
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,640
- It's...
- Ning Meng.

270
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,170
Can I add another number to this delivery app?

271
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,460
Sure.

272
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,270
Then can I pay for two different shops at the same time?

273
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,150
You can't.

274
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,360
I don't know how to do it. Help me with it.

275
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,380
<i>[Ms. Han, 2301, No. 6, Lane 8, Tiantong Road, Jing'an District]</i>

276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,930
Is it done?

277
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,670
Almost.

278
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,500
Done.

279
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,510
Thanks.

280
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,400
You're welcome.

281
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,080
What were you saying? Sorry.

282
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,080
The Mobi fitness equipment.

283
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,860
We've researched other brands in the market.

284
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,620
Mobi has an advantage, it's foldable...

285
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,900
Hello?

286
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,080
<i>Lu Mingming, I found out what happened with Meng.</i>

287
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,960
<i>She probably came</i>

288
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,480
back because she broke up.

289
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,310
She and the guy dated for quite some time.

290
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,360
They were about to get engaged.

291
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,730
The break-up must have been a huge blow to Meng.

292
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,880
What exactly happened?

293
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>There's no way my friend would know the details.</i>

294
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:33,110
After this ordeal, do you think Meng would go back to the States?

295
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,680
Ning Meng. Finished work?

296
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,430
Mr. Zeng.

297
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,280
Anyway, Mr. Lu sent the Mobi fitness project to me and asked me to take a look.

298
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,930
I think he's going to be busy these days.

299
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,510
He's quite busy lately.

300
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,400
Yes, a friend came back from overseas.

301
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,740
He wants to spend more time with her.

302
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,820
Mr. Zeng, I'd like to ask you something.

303
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,370
You're back.

304
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,930
Yes.

305
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,000
You didn't like the food I ordered?

306
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,670
No, I think it's because of the jet lag.

307
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,620
I have no appetite.

308
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,950
Even so, you have to eat something.

309
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,730
The food's gone cold.

310
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,310
Let me buy something else.

311
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,260
It's okay.

312
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,680
You could get some instant noodles.

313
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,030
Instant noodles?

314
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,980
While I was in the States, I really craved the instant noodles here.

315
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,100
When you were little, you would argue with your parents just so you could eat instant noodles.

316
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:54,360
The harder it is to eat it, the more you find it delicious.

317
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,840
I do miss those moments.

318
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,800
It's soft.

319
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,800
Let's wait a bit.

320
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,600
<i>We're here again.</i>

321
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
<i>I really couldn't find the time.</i>

322
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
<i>After agonizing about it, I could only leave him with you guys.</i>

323
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,600
<i>It's okay.</i>

324
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
<i>Yimeng is happy to know Jiming's coming.</i>

325
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,100
<i>Really?</i>

326
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,800
<i>Don't be impatient.</i>

327

<i>I'm not.</i>

328
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
<i>I don't want to eat it.</i>

329
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
<i>Mingming, is this nice?</i>

330
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,800
<i>It's ugly.</i>

331
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,600
<i>Is it not nice?</i>

332
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,800
<i>It's a little better than before.</i>

333
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>I'll draw again.</i>

334
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,800
From primary to high school,

335
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,300
it was Meng who accompanied him.

336
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,100
Especially after his parents divorced,

337
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,000
Meng was the only person he had.

338
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,700
In high school,

339
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,200
Meng went to study arts in New York.

340
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,500
It left a huge impact on Lu Mingming.

341
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
Did he not confess his feelings?

342
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,000
He did.

343
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,600
It was the day before Meng was set to leave.

344
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,200
I coaxed him to do it.

345
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,600
But Meng thought he was still a kid.

346
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,100
That he was being childish.

347
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,200
She didn't think much of it.

348
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
So after all these years,

349
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,800
he's still waiting for her?

350
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,400
How could a guy be so stubborn?

351
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,800
I tried to reason with him many times.

352
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,900
Guess what he said?

353
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,700
He said,

354
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,400
"It was Meng who accompanied me through the loneliest

355
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,400
and the most desperate period in my life.

356
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,500
I'm willing to wait for her.

357
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,000
I'll wait for her to turn around and see me for who I am.

358
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,700
No longer a kid, but a man."

359
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,100
That's what he said.

360
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,000
Are you okay, Ning Meng?

361
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,100
I'm fine.

362
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
Now Meng is back.

363
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,500
I suppose she'd see him now.

364
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Okay.

365
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,300
Well. It's late.

366
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,400
I should go. There's still work to do.

367
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,800
Okay, all the best. I'll see you out.

368
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,300
Thank you. I'm good.

369
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,400
Ning Meng.

370
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,600
Maybe telling you everything

371
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
is me doing something good.

372
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,600
Thanks.

373
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Bye-bye.

I'm going to order supper. What would you like, Mengmeng?

00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,700
Barbecue?

380
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
You go ahead. I'm not eating.

You've been brooding since you came back.

What's the matter?

I'm your best friend.

You can talk to me.

Even if I can't be of help,

387
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,600
I can still be a listener.

388
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,300
It's regarding my project.

389
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,400
My boss wants to work together with our strategic partner.

390
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
But the other side has yet to reply.

391
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,800
I can't push the project to the next stage.

392
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't know much about what you do at work.

393
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
But why do I get the feeling

394
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,800
that your moodiness isn't due to work?

395
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Is the person not replying Lu Jiming?

396
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I could guess even if you didn't say it.

397
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,600
Since seeing him with the other girl at the airport,

398
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,700
you've been upset.

399
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,000
There were also the numerous calls you got at night.

400
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,800
No matter what problems you had before with work,

401
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,400
you were never as bothered as you are now.

402
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,100
Mengmeng, do you have feelings for him?

403
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
You're not saying anything, so it means yes.

404
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,500
So the guy you said you kissed was him, right?

405
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,900
That was an accident. We accidentally touched lips.

406
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,600
It was really by mistake.

407
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
I see, I got it.

408
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
The kiss was an accident, but liking him is not.

409
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
It is.

410
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,000
I just don't get it myself.

411
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,300
A guy like him is arrogant, childish, and bad-tempered.

412
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,000
How could I...

413
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,700
How could you?

414
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,000
The more you say things like that, the more infatuated you sound.

415
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
But I can't.

416
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Is it because of the pretty lady at the airport?

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,800
I just found out that she's his childhood sweetheart.

418
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,800
The woman is Lu Jiming's Juliet.

419
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
He's been waiting for her all these years.

420
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,700
Goodness. I didn't expect him to be so loyal.

421
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Since there's no hope, then just give it up.

422
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,700
While you are only a little bit into him,

423
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
it's not too late.

424
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,900
I know.

425
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,900
But you still have to interact with him for work, right?

426
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,000
Are you mentally prepared?

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
What I'm hoping now

428
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,400
is that he's not interested in this project and won't invest in it.

429
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,500
So I don't have to see him. Let me keep my distance.

430
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,600
So annoying.

431
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000

434
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,200
You said you didn't want it.

435
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800

436

I haven't been sleeping well.

Drinking helps me to sleep.

It's nothing. Leave me be.

444
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,200
I could do with some fresh air alone.

00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,000
I can't sleep either.

Besides,

455
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,700
I really don't want to talk about them.

Don't be silly.

459
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,900
It's already happened.

460
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,700
I thought it was in the past now.

461
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,900
I should be able to forget everything with time.

462

I thought I was strong.

466
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,200
I thought by coming back to a familiar place

467
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,800
and seeing familiar faces,

468
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,000
I'd be able to get better.

469
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,200
I didn't think it'd be this hard to get over.

470
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,600
I really don't...

471
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,500
I don't want you to see me like this.

472
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,800
Don't you find me laughable?

473
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,700
You're not.

474
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,600
Think about it. Even if I laughed at others, I'd never laugh at you.

475
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
I don't have any tissue with me.

476
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,400
Why don't I pick some leaves

477
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,200
for you to wipe your tears?

478
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,400

Not yet?

492
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,400
I think you need to go to his office and chase him.

493
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Ask him to give an answer.

494
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,800
Is that okay?

495
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,500
What if they think we're pushing him?

496
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,100
But we are.

497
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,200
Since we want to partner up,

498
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,500
we have to take the initiative.

499
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
Okay.

500
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,000
Xiaoyang,

501
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
help me set a meeting with Mr. Lu.

502
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Xiaoyang.

503
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
Ning Meng.

504
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,500
Come in.

505
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Mr. Lu.

506
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,100
Sit.

507
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,700
You're here to talk about Mobi, right?

508
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,900
Yes.

509
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,500
I've read the proposal.

510
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
I think it's quite bland.

511
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,800
Please tell Ms. Shi that we won't be investing in this project.

512
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
All right.

513
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
Aren't you going to ask why?

514
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,500
I'm sure you have your reasons.

515
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,600
If there's nothing else, I'll be off then.

516
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,600
Ning Meng.

517
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,600
I have a question to ask you.

518
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,400
When you're feeling down,

519
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,000
what do you normally do to feel better?

520
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,400
I'll listen to jokes or comedy skits.

521
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,300
Or watch talk shows online.

522
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,400
I'd feel better after a good laugh.

523
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,200
Could you tell me a few jokes?

524
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Just like the joke you told me when we were at the canteen

525
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
of the Phoenix Industry Samples.

526
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,300
That sort.

527
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,300
Do a search online. You can find all sorts there.

528
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm off.

529
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Didn't Mr. Lu say anything else?

530
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,800
No.

531
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
The sector is a little small.

532
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,700
From the market's point of view,

533
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:19,600
a product like Mobi would have difficulty generating interest.

534
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Listen, Ning Meng.

535
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,100
What about we set aside this project for now?

536
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,300
Ms. Shi, currently, people's awareness of health is on the rise.

537
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,400
So there are opportunities in the fitness market.

538
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,000
As for consumption demands,

539
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
we could work on the product design...

540
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,400
Have you spoken to Mr. Lu about this?

541
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
He's probably busy these days.

542
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,200
He only told me his final decision.

543
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,100
But isn't Mr. Lu always busy?

544
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,700
How come this time there wasn't even time for a discussion?

545
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,900
Did something happen between you and Mr. Lu?

546
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,300
No.

547
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,500
Ms. Shi, are we relying too much

548
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,200
on Mr. Lu's judgment?

549
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,800
Mr. Lu is my strategic partner.

550
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,200
For sure, I have to take into account his opinions.

551
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,800
I'm not saying we shouldn't listen to him.

552
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,200
But I think we can make our own assessment.

553
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Ning Meng, in investment,

554
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,500
you need funding, resources, and experience.

555
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,600
I have the resources,

556
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,000
but I'm lacking experience.

557
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,400
It takes a long time to accumulate and build experience.

558
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
And you'll need to pay a hefty tuition fee.

559
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,500
So if our company could partner up

560
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,400
with a more experienced one during its infancy,

561
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,000
get some pointers,

562
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,600
then our company would grow at a faster rate.

563
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,000
Ms. Shi.

564
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,200
Have you been favoring and looking out for me

565
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,000
because of my connection with Mr. Lu?

566
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

567
