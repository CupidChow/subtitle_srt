1
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
(Episode 31)

2
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
So?

3
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,079
Got it.

4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,999
We almost lost everything.

5
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,319
I was so scared.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
There's still me as the last line of defense.

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Yes. You're amazing, Mr. Lu.

9
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm flattered.

10
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,400
I think it's thanks to Ms. Ning's psychological attack.

11
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,280
I concede defeat.

12
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,560
Right. Did Qiu Jun Lin open the bag?

13
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,199
I think so.

14
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,439
Mr. Lu, Ning Meng. How was it?

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,159
The investigators have all the materials.

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,159
As for the rest,

17
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,599
leave it to the police.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What about you two?

19
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,159
We also went to the police.

20
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,479
We were fined a little.

21
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,039
Don't take me with you the next time you ride an electric bike.

22
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,639
No, I'm taking you.

23
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,559
I'll recommend another one...

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
you can use it daily for work.

25
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,599
This one's pretty.

26
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,599
- I'll try it. - Okay.

27
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Try it.

28
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,999
This lipstick makes your complexion brighter...

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,718
even without wearing makeup, right?

30
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,758
It's really nice.

31
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,319
- You have a good eye. - Right?

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,960
It suits your skin tone well.

33
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,719
This one is good...

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,319
for parties and dinners.

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
This one gives a sweet look.

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
It's good for dates.

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,639
This is good for daily use and work.

38
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,039
Then I'll take all three.

39
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,319
Okay, I'll wrap them up for you.

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,799
There's also a foundation that's perfect for you.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,918
Do you want to try it?

42
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,719
- Sure, I'll take a look. - Come.

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,759
These are your items.

44
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,159
The receipt is inside.

45
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,559
Thanks for the recommendation.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,599
You're welcome.

47
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,158
Here are some samples.

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,159
Give them a try.

49
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,959
If it suits you, you can buy the actual item.

50
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,599
- Okay. - Thank you.

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,599
Meng Meng.

52
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,680
You're good.

53
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,170
I just watched for a second and you sold six orders already.

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,318
Do you want to help me and make it seven?

55
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,480
This one suits you.

56
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,439
Are you addicted to doing business?

57
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,439
I'll buy you supper tonight.

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
- Sure. - I have good news for you.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,279
What is it?

60
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,560
Evidence has been handed over to the investigators.

61
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,319
He Yue Lan and the rest won't be happy for long.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,730
Qi Qi.

63
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,879
It's okay.

64
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,759
That man has nothing to do with me anymore.

65
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,920
However,

66
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,319
I'd like to see the look on his face when he's caught.

67
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,730
Me too.

68
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,610
Right.

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,199
I saw that woman today.

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,610
Which woman?

71
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Quan Ru Ru?

72
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,518
But she wasn't with He Yue Lan.

73
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,800
She was with another man at the maternity store.

74
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
Is He Yue Lan getting two-timed?

75
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,120
It's good if that's the case.

76
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,279
But the problem He Yue Lan is now facing...

77
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,879
is worse than him being two-timed.

78
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,160
Don't touch these pointy things.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,318
- It's dangerous. - What's wrong?

80
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,758
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

81
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,079
- I'm fine. - Sit down and get some rest.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
From now on, you don't have to do anything.

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,278
Just rest.

84
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,319
Leave everything to me.

85
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,839
Can you do it?

86
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,319
Of course.

87
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
He kicked me.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
He kicked you?

89
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,040
The little one must be hungry.

90
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,439
I'll make you breakfast now.

91
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,599
Hello. Are you the person in charge...

92
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,039
of the Shanghai branch of Renning Insurance,

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Mr. He Yue Lan?

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,039
Yes, I am.

95
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,239
We are the Economic Investigation Unit...

96
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,279
from Shanghai Pudong Police.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,999
This is the summon.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,839
Please cooperate with the investigation.

99
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,319
Okay.

100
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,600
Jin Hai Yang!

101
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,680
Economic Investigation Unit from Shanghai Pudong Police.

102
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,399
We would like to talk to you.

103
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,560
Please come with us.

104
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,399
Zhao Chang Hai.

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,199
Please come with us.

106
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,439
The direction of smart communities...

107
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,559
is still focusing on building a healthy development...

108
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,120
of the composite ecosystem.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,599
We can use...

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,119
the sewage treatment system...

111
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
and eco-friendly materials.

112
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,720
Mr. Lu, they've been caught.

113
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,679
Yesterday, General Manager He Yue Lan...

114
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,719
of Renning Insurance Shanghai,

115
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,719
Chairman Yan Shuang Xun of Shuangxun Group,

116
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,758
Director Zhao Chang Hai,

117
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,318
Chairman Jin Hai Yang of Phoenix Capital,

118
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,559
and others who are involved...

119
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,959
were taken away for an investigation by the authorities.

120
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
What else is on the news?

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's evidence that...

122
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,559
the above persons...

123
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,919
are suspected of colluding...

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,198
in the malicious acquisition of Qinhe's shares...

125
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,279
and manipulated the stock market.

126
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,680
They received mutual benefits...

127
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
and severely violated the secondary market order...

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
and the interests of stockholders.

129
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,999
Economic Investigation Department and CSRC...

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,559
will join forces to investigate thoroughly...

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
and return clarity to the financial markets.

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
That's great.

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,078
Their good days...

134
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,240
are finally over.

135
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,398
What a great turn of events.

136
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,000
Justice is served.

137
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,119
Nanlin's shares have been suspended...

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
and are under investigation by relevant authorities.

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,079
Qiu Jun Lin and Chen Xiao Yi have been brought in.

140
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,838
That's great.

141
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,319
Stinky fish and shrimp in one pot.

142
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,159
It must be lively in the pot now...

143
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,198
from fighting among themselves.

144
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,639
Even I want to see it live.

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
- They must be throwing punches. - Mr. Lu.

146
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
Did you see the news?

147
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,079
We've told him.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,519
Let's applaud then.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,039
Dad.

150
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,519
The people who harmed you...

151
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
have all been caught.

152
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,919
Those related to this case...

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,480
won't be able to escape.

154
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,360
(Grave of Liu Tian Xing)

155
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,000
Dad, don't worry.

156
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,039
Ms. Liu is doing well.

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,000
I go back to have dinner with her every weekend.

158
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm doing fine on my own.

159
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,720
In the past,

160
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,879
I always competed with you.

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,840
I always tried to do something...

162
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,120
to prove myself.

163
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,039
After all this time,

164
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
I finally understood...

165
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,279
that one shouldn't be so hard on themselves.

166
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,840
That's just making it harder for others.

167
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,039
Everyone cares about me.

168
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,360
Now, I can put myself...

169
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,879
in someone else's shoes.

170
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,679
I feel like this is really good.

171
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,090
Dad.

172
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,000
Ning Meng is now Ms. Ning.

173
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,329
Both of us started a new company...

174
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,360
called L&M Capital.

175
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:17,919
We do...

176
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,559
long-term integrated projects...

177
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,519
in smart communities.

178
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,799
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

179
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,840
We'll bring the eco-friendly concept you always insisted on...

180
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,720
to the smart community project.

181
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,559
Lu Guo Yu and I met a few times.

182
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,639
He deeply regrets...

183
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,159
about what happened.

184
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,919
Don't worry.

185
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,158
Qinhe...

186
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,330
will adhere to your business philosophy.

187
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,879
At the same time, they'll be our allies.

188
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,960
We'll work together.

189
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Dad.

190
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,600
As for what you failed to achieve,

191
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,120
we'll take it from here.

192
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,919
(Grave of Liu Tian Xing)

193
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,600
I haven't felt this relaxed in a long time.

194
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Me too.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,360
You barely ate lunch.

196
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,879
You must be hungry.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
A little bit.

198
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,639
We've gotten our revenge.

199
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,559
The company gradually going on the right track.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,679
Shouldn't we...

201
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,480
have a meal to celebrate?

202
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,000
I thought I would be very happy...

203
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
after seeing them get caught.

204
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,799
But I'm rather quite calm instead.

205
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,399
I'll pass on the celebration.

206
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Let's just eat something simple.

207
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,200
What do you want to eat? I'll make the reservation.

208
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,120
Teach me how to make Ning's Signature.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,279
Sure.

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
Come on.

211
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,240
The apron looks good on you.

212
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,679
Let's fry it.

213
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,558
That reminds me of the way...

214
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,399
kids light firecrackers.

215
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,720
Good thing it didn't hit your face.

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,080
Or else, your face will be ruined.

217
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
I don't make a living with my looks.

218
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,839
- Don't bother wrapping it. - No.

219
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,879
It will blister.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
Do you smell that?

221
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,159
I left the stove on.

222
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,519
Wrap it yourself.

223
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,559
Ning Meng.

224
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Where are the scissors?

225
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,480
It's in the console. Look for it.

226
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,000
Did you find it?

227
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,559
Yes.

228
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,679
Thanks.

229
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,519
It's nothing.

230
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,878
I saw that it was injured...

231
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,080
and just wrapped it up.

232
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,720
Not bad. You revived it.

233
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,799
Ms. Ning.

234
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,279
Would you like to try my tea?

235
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,159
You'll be detoxified after drinking it.

236
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,240
It's okay. Give it to Xiao Song.

237
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Good idea.

238
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Ning Meng.

239
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,759
I have something to tell you.

240
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
What's wrong?

241
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,080
The police just called me.

242
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,240
He Yue Lan and the others...

243
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,679
admitted to everything regarding Qinhe.

244
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,159
But no one is willing to admit...

245
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,639
to manipulating the fixed income stock.

246
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,278
Is it because...

247
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,120
they still have the fluke mentality?

248
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,239
Maybe they will confess to it...

249
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
after two days of interrogation.

250
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,480
It doesn't make sense to me.

251
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,679
Qinhe is such a big deal...

252
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,919
and they all already confessed to it.

253
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,919
There's no need to hide anymore.

254
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Ning Meng.

255
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,919
I have a hunch.

256
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,960
It's not that they won't admit it...

257
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,679
but there's someone else behind it.

258
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,360
Who could it be?

259
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,200
Apart from Qiu Jun Lin and Jin Hai Yang,

260
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,799
who else has a grudge against you?

261
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,720
They're obviously targeting you.

262
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,759
What's wrong?

263
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,960
Nothing.

264
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,279
Think carefully.

265
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,920
It's important.

266
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,279
Was someone in the restroom that day?

267
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,240
I really can't remember.

268
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,079
Do you remember how many people were there...

269
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,279
when you barged into the room?

270
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I just focused on He Yue Lan and Chen Xiao Yi.

271
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,839
Was Quan Ru Ru there too?

272
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,410
Look at this.

273
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,839
Were these people there that day?

274
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,079
(Director Zhao Chang Hai)

275
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,799
Why is it him?

276
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,279
Who is it?

277
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Zhao Chang Hai.

278
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,838
He was the one who accompanied Quan Ru Ru...

279
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,039
at the maternity store.

280
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,759
I remember him.

281
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,839
He was standing by the pool table...

282
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,519
with Quan Ru Ru.

283
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,599
I see. They were already together then.

284
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,079
(Jin Hai Yang)

285
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,680
I don't remember much about Jin Hai Yang.

286
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,079
Was he in the restroom?

287
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,920
Not him.

288
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
Do you remember someone bumped into us when we left?

289
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,519
That was Jin Hai Yang.

290
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,650
Don't worry, Ning Meng.

291
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,758
Trust the police.

292
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,119
I'm sure they'll find out.

293
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,440
That person can't run.

294
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,920
I know who to ask.

295
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,559
Hey.

296
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,240
Ms. Quan, I'm Ning Meng.

297
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,170
I need to talk to you.

298
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,799
Have a seat.

299
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,759
How did you find me?

300
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,279
You forgot your parcel.

301
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,039
Thanks.

302
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,319
Why did you want to see me?

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,799
He Yue Lan's little gang.

304
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,000
Besides Mr. Zhao and Jin Hai Yang,

305
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,559
who else is there?

306
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,119
I don't know.

307
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,680
The day You Qi went to the karaoke,

308
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
there was another person hiding in the restroom.

309
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,039
Who was it?

310
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,799
I really don't know.

311
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,170
He Yue Lan's money and house...

312
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,319
are all frozen.

313
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,319
Your life right now...

314
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,000
must be tough.

315
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,799
But you're going to a private hospital...

316
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,079
and a high-end maternity store.

317
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,039
Seems like you're doing quite well.

318
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,410
Who's taking care of you?

319
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,559
Mr. Zhao?

320
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,319
You two are close, aren't you?

321
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,279
Don't spout nonsense.

322
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,920
What proof do you have?

323
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
I'm not interested in your matter.

324
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,759
I just want the answer to my question.

325
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:40,839
His name is Jason.

326
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:45,039
He seems to be Yue Lan's friend...

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,799
who came back from abroad.

328
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,519
I only met him that one time.

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,279
What's his Chinese name?

330
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
I don't know.

331
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,960
What else do you remember? Little things are fine too.

332
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,240
He must be a rich person.

333
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,519
I remember he was wearing a Patek Philippe watch.

334
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,079
It's worth a lot of money.

335
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,239
Whose WeChat Moments is this?

336
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,559
This watch is very expensive.

337
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,359
Shen Xi.

338
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,240
Is it him?

339
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,000
Jason looks more mature than him.

340
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,799
He's tall.

341
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,160
Is it him?

342
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, that's him.

343
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
Any news?

344
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,558
The negative news about your fixed stock...

345
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,079
was fake news made by an unscrupulous public account.

346
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,480
It has been blocked for a while now.

347
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,799
I'm still looking into it.

348
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
The majority shareholder fled before the shortfall.

349
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,839
It's obvious...

350
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,480
they discussed beforehand.

351
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,279
Ming Ming, your guess was right.

352
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,119
Then do you know...

353
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,000
who the majority shareholder is now a limited partner of?

354
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,319
Is it him?

355
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,000
I found out who manipulated that fixed income stock.

356
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
I know.

357
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,200
I already talked to him.

358
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,640
(17th New Forces Awards Ceremony)

359
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,239
Next to be revealed to everyone...

360
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,400
is the most significant award tonight.

361
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,680
The winner of the Top 10 Outstanding Investor awards is...

362
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,400
Mr. Su Wei Ran from BDI.

363
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,359
Congratulations, Mr. Su.

364
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,758
I'd like to invite the award presenter,

365
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:38,279
Mr. Zhang Peng Yang.

366
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Please.

367
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,200
Congratulations.

368
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,798
Next, let's welcome Mr. Su...

369
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:56,200
to share with us his investment philosophy.

370
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,599
Thank you to the organizers, thank you all.

371
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,039
We live in a world of rapid development.

372
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,000
The winds of change...

373
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
are fleeting.

374
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
It increasingly tests...

375
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,880
the ability and courage to seize any opportunity.

376
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,640
Investment is a gamble.

377
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
And the capital market...

378
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:19,519
is a jungle full of danger.

379
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,960
Today, you're a hunter who chases your prey.

380
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,278
Tomorrow,

381
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,839
you may be someone else's lunch.

382
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,759
It sounds cruel.

383
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,519
But to me,

384
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,880
it's very fair.

385
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,799
Because only true risk takers...

386
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,119
and the capable...

387
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,759
are be able to win...

388
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,039
in this competition.

389
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
This award means a lot to me.

390
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,559
It's an affirmation, but more of a motivation.

391
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,839
I thank you again.

392
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,279
Tomorrow,

393
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,880
let us run the acceleration of wealth together.

394
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,559
Let us create a greater value.

395
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Thank you.

396
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,480
- Mr. Su, congratulations. - Thank you.

397
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,799
You're really bold.

398
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,039
You look like a gentleman...

399
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,839
but that's some pretty sharp talk.

400
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
You have a bright future ahead of you.

401
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
You're too kind.

402
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,758
I'll visit your company one day.

403
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,960
I'll be waiting.

404
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,200
Okay, bye.

405
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,279
- Bye. - Goodbye, Mr. Su.

406
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,759
Mr. Su, the car is out front.

407
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,200
- You go ahead. - Okay.

408
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,920
When did you get here, Mr. Lu?

409
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,960
You've won this award too, right?

410
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,160
You've prepared your acceptance speech...

411
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,640
for a long time, haven't you?

412
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,240
I just improvised.

413
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Here's my advice.

414
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,599
Prepare a good confession.

415
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,480
Give it a good thought.

416
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,279
Improvising may not be beneficial to you.

417
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
Why did my fixed income stock crash?

418
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm sure you know.

419
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:28,839
Mr. Lu.

420
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,720
The stock market has risks.

421
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,599
You don't have to play if you can't afford to take it.

422
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,400
Lest blame others...

423
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,759
for your bad luck.

424
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,440
You see,

425
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,480
I've always been a lucky person.

426
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,559
He Yue Lan, Jin Hai Yang,

427
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,480
and the guys from Shuangxun...

428
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,319
have been taken away to be investigated.

429
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,720
You know that, right?

430
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,359
Yes.

431
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,680
It's all over the internet.

432
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,400
Are you scared?

433
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,160
What for?

434
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Renning, Shuangxun,

435
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,559
and Phoenix Capital...

436
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,640
colluded to annex Qinhe.

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,599
I think you already know that.

438
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,279
Maybe you didn't want to make a move then...

439
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,680
because you already had the fund...

440
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,000
and the people to fix the stock price.

441
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,640
All you had to do was to sit back and watch.

442
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,079
When did you...

443
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,519
decide to take action?

444
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
If I'm not mistaken,

445
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,400
it was...

446
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,279
after the derby.

447
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,200
You knew that I would grab the stocks.

448
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,079
I needed that fixed income stock...

449
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,400
to come back alive.

450
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,079
But at that time,

451
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,160
they had just taken over Qinhe.

452
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,680
They didn't have the strength left to deal with me.

453
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,319
So you decided to do it yourself.

454
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,078
You found someone...

455
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,079
to spread fake news around.

456
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,519
You colluded with the major shareholder...

457
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,319
to pull out in time.

458
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,039
You and He Yue Lan are different.

459
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,039
They were simply after the money.

460
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,119
But you...

461
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
You were out to destroy me.

462
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,799
Mr. Lu.

463
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,720
I understand how you feel.

464
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,200
But what you said...

465
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,960
has nothing to do with me.

466
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,880
You've got the wrong person.

467
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
Excuse me.

468
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,720
- I'll get going. - Today, you're the hunter.

469
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,359
Tomorrow, you may be someone else's lunch.

470
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,920
I came today...

471
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,000
to hear about your thoughts on investing.

472
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,880
But after I heard it,

473
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,079
I realized that...

474
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,759
your understanding of investment...

475
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,079
is still in the primitive phase.

476
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
Let alone understanding humans.

477
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,519
Just animal instinct.

478
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,200
It's sad.

479
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Lu Ji Ming.

480
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,480
Do you know what I hate most about you?

481
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
You being so high and mighty.

482
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,079
Have you ever suffered?

483
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,000
Have you ever been trampled on?

484
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,480
Do you know the feeling...

485
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,358
of having someone else take away what's precious from you?

486
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,440
No, you don't.

487
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,758
You were born...

488
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:24,440
to have people to trample on.

489
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,640
What right do you have to comment on my thoughts on investment?

490
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,240
Sorry.

491
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,039
I'm the winner.

492
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,680
Did you really win?

493
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,599
You've already lost what's the most important.

494
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,279
I never thought Wei Ran would turn out like this.

495
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,640
I should've figured it out sooner.

496
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,759
This again?

497
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,480
This has nothing to do with you.

498
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,359
He hated me from the start.

499
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,200
He thinks...

500
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,640
besides being born into a good family,

501
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,119
I have nothing else.

502
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,200
So what are you going to do now?

503
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,000
I assume He Yue Lan and the rest kept him out of it...

504
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,960
because they had a deal.

505
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,159
Zeng Yu Hang and I...

506
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,000
could only find out he was connected to the shareholder.

507
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,680
I'll go talk to him.

508
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Forget it.

509
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,480
It's all in the past now.

510
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,319
I don't want you to take any chances.

511
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,160
But...

512
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,319
he should be held responsible for his mistake.

513
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,640
I don't want...

514
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,519
to see him make any more mistakes.

515
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
And I think...

516
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,240
he's not yet...

517
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,200
at the stage where he is completely hopeless.

518
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,079
Did you really win?

519
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,769
Ning Meng.

520
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,809
What brings you here?

521
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Have some tea.

522
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,119
Thank you.

523
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,639
Wei Ran.

524
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,400
Do you remember?

525
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:06,769
In college,

526
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,440
there was a guy in my batch called Wen Li.

527
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,289
He was always bullying others.

528
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,920
Everyone hated him.

529
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:18,769
Vaguely.

530
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,329
Why are you suddenly bringing him up?

531
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,679
I remember...

532
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,079
whenever someone did something bad,

533
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,840
they would call themselves Wen Li.

534
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,639
He probably still doesn't know about that.

535
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,599
He took all the blame for others.

536
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,360
It's the same for you, isn't it?

537
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,159
Jason.

538
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,039
So you know.

539
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,769
A rich guy named Jason...

540
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,039
stole Shen Xi away.

541
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,239
You never got over it.

542
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:24,239
So whenever...

543
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
you're doing something bad,

544
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,000
you would call yourself Jason.

545
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,360
It's psychological revenge...

546
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,289
and also a form of subconscious escape.

547
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,439
That time,

548
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,519
when I talked to you about Shen Xi,

549
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,679
you said...

550
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,039
you had already let it all go.

551
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,719
But in truth, you're still standing in that shadow.

552
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,039
You've never gotten over it.

553
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,289
Ning Meng.

554
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,769
I didn't lie to you.

555
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,239
I don't hate Shen Xi.

556
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,960
What I hate is...

557
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,000
the person who took her away.

558
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,079
It's hard for you to know what it's like.

559
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
In the past,

560
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,880
I learned about the world through books.

561
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,440
I thought everything was intertwined.

562
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:30,039
That I would be rewarded for my effort.

563
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,199
That hard work pays off.

564
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,119
But after I went abroad,

565
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,329
all of that changed.

566
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
It was a school...

567
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,719
I worked so hard to get into.

568
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,039
But they were people...

569
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,289
who got in easily through connections.

570
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:53,440
I lived frugally.

571
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:54,840
My one month's worth of living expenses...

572
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,360
was nothing compared to their money for a meal.

573
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,880
The way they courted girls...

574
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,360
was something I had never heard of.

575
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
You don't know...

576
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,039
what their background is.

577
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,288
You don't know...

578
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,119
where their money is from.

579
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,769
In this world,

580
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,719
many things are unfair.

581
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:21,360
I understand you, Wei Ran.

582
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,559
Really.

583
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,400
I have also been treated unfairly.

584
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,079
But these are not the reasons to change us.

585
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,159
Don't you agree?

586
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,440
You seem to have everything you've always wanted.

587
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,000
But are you truly happy?

588
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,039
What else do you want to know?

589
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
I'll tell you everything.

590
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,480
You, He Ye Luan and the rest...

591
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,559
When did you conspire with each other?

592
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,239
Remember your pitch for Mobi?

593
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,840
That was the first time He Yue Lan asked me to meet me.

594
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,769
But you asked me to your pitch last minute,

595
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
so I rejected him.

596
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,329
And then,

597
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,119
at the dinner when you were promoted to manager,

598
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
we met again.

599
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:20,289
Renning Insurance?

600
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,158
Didn't I ask to meet you before?

601
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,479
So you're Mr. Su from BDI.

602
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,519
Yes.

603
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,639
What a coincidence.

604
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
At first,

605
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,639
we only had a professional relationship.

606
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,359
Then when we got to know...

607
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,960
our opponent's style of conduct,

608
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,440
he asked me...

609
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,039
if I was interested in a big project.

610
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:45,679
That big project...

611
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:47,880
was the annexation of Qinhe.

612
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,039
So you knew from the start.

613
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,159
No wonder.

614
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,559
No wonder when Lu Ji Ming asked He Yue Lan for help,

615
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,960
you didn't mind at all.

616
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,360
I support you in this.

617
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,079
After all, he is your ex-boss.

618
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,679
You should help him.

619
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,679
I was quite touched then.

620
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,360
But it was all part of your plan.

621
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:17,879
If back then,

622
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,639
Lu Ji Ming didn't come to me,

623
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,199
you would still lead me to him, am I right?

624
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,079
And You Qi's birthday celebration.

625
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:28,199
You chose not to go on purpose.

626
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,119
It's You Qi's birthday tomorrow.

627
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,719
Yue Lan and I want to celebrate with her.

628
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,719
Then I won't bother you guys.

629
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,440
Help me wish You Qi a happy birthday.

630
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,159
You were afraid I'd find out you were in the same boat.
