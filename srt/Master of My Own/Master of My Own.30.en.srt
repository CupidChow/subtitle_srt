3
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,270
<i>Ms. Shi.</i>

4
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:47,630
<i>If it weren't for your guidance,</i>

5
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,270
<i>I wouldn't have grown this fast.</i>

6
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,810
<i>I'm truly thankful.</i>

7
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,590
<i>But Mr. Lu was my first boss...</i>

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,530
<i>and the one who led me into the capital market.</i>

9
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,400
<i>So I want to go back and help him.</i>

10
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,820
<i>Ning Meng, do your best to help him if you want.</i>

11
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,180
<i>Mr. Lu has been a great help to our company all these years.</i>

12
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,150
<i>We used a lot of his connections and resources.</i>

13
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,060
<i>Now that he's in trouble, it'd be reasonable</i>

14
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,750
<i>for me to support you to help him.</i>

15
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,490
<i>Furthermore, Mr. Lu and I are strategic partners.</i>

16
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,170
<i>It's not wrong to help my partner.</i>

17
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,730
<i>When you have spare time, come back and visit us.</i>

18
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,600
<i>Thank you, Ms. Shi.</i>

19
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,910
<i>I should be thanking you.</i>

20
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
How's the new fund going?

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,400
I don't even have a proper business card.

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,820
It's not that they look down on you. They just can't see you.

23
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,930
I've talked to Mr. Liang, Tang Zhengwang, and the rest.

24
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,650
They're willing to be your LPs.

25
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,260
Mr. Lin from Mobi, too.

26
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,070
His company has been listed on the NEEQ.

27
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,560
He's also willing to invest in us.

28
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,240
Not forgetting my savings over the years.

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,890
It may not be much, but it's better than nothing.

30
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Ning Meng, why are you helping me?

31
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,220
When I first started working, you guided me for three years.

32
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,970
You may have kept me as your secretary

33
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,980
and had forbidden me from managing investment projects.

34
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,620
It was hard to manage someone demanding like you.

35
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,740
But when I dove into the field myself,

36
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:20,670
I only realized that you were using your way to protect me.

37
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,140
I've said this before.

38
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,300
To me, you're the best investor.

39
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,250
I've learned a lot from you.

40
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,220
I won't have today's achievements without you.

41
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,510
Just consider it as me repaying your kindness.

42
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,750
Also, you told me

43
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,130
that investing is something worth being happy about.

44
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,480
That's how I feel.

45
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,290
At that time,

46
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,390
did you want to ask if I could come back and help you?

47
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,110
That'll depend on your sincerity.

48
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,580
So are you willing to be my partner,

49
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,600
Ms. Ning?

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,580
Deal.

51
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,350
Is this how you treat your company's new shareholders?

52
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,890
Shouldn't you coax me and let me win?

53
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,340
- I already gave way to you.
- How is this giving way?

54
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,540
Lu Mingming, I've invested all my savings in you.

55
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,120
If Tiantian's parents refuse to let me marry her because of this,

56
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,430
you'll have to be responsible for me.

57
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
No matter what,

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm grateful to you and Tiantian.

59
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,020
I'll manage these funds properly.

60
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,800
When the time comes, I'll let you marry Tiantian in honor.

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,680
Now, this is the "Lu Jiming" I know.

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,070
Deal! I'll wait until you turn the tables.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,920
So, what's your relationship with Ning Meng now?

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,990
Partners.

65
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,520
You already went back to her hometown and met her parents.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,110
Don't you want to take your relationship a step further?

67
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,320
It's not the time.

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,720
Ning Meng just broke up not too long ago.

69
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Moreover, I'm in huge debt now.

70
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,940
I haven't taken my revenge and paid my debts.

71
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,340
I can't give her anything.

72
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,980
Do you think this is what she wants?

73
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,900
Why did she break up if she wanted to live a luxurious life?

74
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,280
If she married Su Weiran, she'd have everything.

75
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,470
Am I right?

76
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,840
I know.

77
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,650
You've missed out once.

78
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,900
Don't miss out again this time.

79
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Thanks.

80
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
How's the plan for your new company going?

81
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,110
Let me see.

82
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,000
Why are you searching for houses?

83
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,370
I can't just stay here, right?

84
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,010
I don't see Tiantian coming anymore.

85
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,370
It's okay.

86
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,880
Tiantian is busy with her work.

87
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,510
You can just stay here without worries.

88
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,250
Don't try to persuade me. I've already made up my mind.

89
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,950
Where are you going to move to?

90
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,000
I haven't found a place yet.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know the situation I'm in right now.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,940
I can't be picky about it.

93
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,690
It's all right as long it's habitable.

94
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,760
Okay.

95
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,240
You have guts. I'll have your back.

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,350
But you need to work first.

97
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,990
You can just leave a small matter like renting a house to me.

98
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,760
So don't worry, okay?

99
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,350
What do you think?

100
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,620
This place looks familiar.

101
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,740
Is it?

102
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,210
That means you like this place.

103
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,440
The layout of the houses here is great. Great environment, too.

104
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,380
The price is not bad either.

105
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,100
Isn't this Ning Meng's place?

106
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,500
Is she staying here, too?

107
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,310
Are you sure?

108
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,380
This isn't important.

109
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,830
What matters is that it has a great layout, a great environment, and a reasonable price.

110
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,150
Enough talking. I've made a lot of effort to find it.

111
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,180
Just move already.

112
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,850
Let's check the place out.

113
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,350
Come on.

114
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,740
<i>[Five Plus]</i>

115
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,710
Mengmeng, how do I look?

116
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,040
The prettiest girl of the century.

117
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,250
I didn't expect to be this happy to spend my own money.

118
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,940
Did you hear anything?

119
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,730
I think it's the purse crying.

120
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,660
Worse comes to worst, I'll just live frugally for the rest of the month.

121
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Whose post is this?

122
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,100
This watch is expensive.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,330
Senior Shen Xi.

124
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,340
Su Weiran's ex-girlfriend?

125
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,780
Let me see.

126
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,850
"Thank you, Jason. For holding my hands for seven years.

127
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,100
I look forward to our next seven years and every seven years of our lives."

128
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,590
That's pretty romantic.

129
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,750
Are you still in touch with Senior?

130
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,420
Then any progress with your ex-boss?

131
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,790
What progress are you talking about?

132
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,160
We just registered the company,

133
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,640
haven't started hiring employees, the renovation isn't done, the driver...

134
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,150
Stop it.

135
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,470
If only you could allocate some of your skills in your career to your relationship.

136
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,990
It's my first time starting a business.

137
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,700
I still think I don't have enough skills for my career.

138
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,710
What a workaholic.

139
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,840
Peel the mango for me.

140
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,940
No.

141
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,860
Please peel it for me.

142
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,800
Fine, I'll peel it for you.

143
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,840
You look even more beautiful now.

144
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you here?

145
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,820
I moved out from Zeng Yuhang's place.

146
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,910
It's not proper to keep staying at their place.

147
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,440
You know the situation I'm in.

148
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,020
So it's hard to find a place to stay.

149
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,270
Zeng Yuhang searched everywhere but he couldn't find anywhere suitable.

150
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,290
This place happens to be for rent.

151
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,280
The price is reasonable, too.

152
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,100
What a coincidence.

153
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,650
Yeah, I think so too.

154
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,040
There's no such thing as coincidence in this world.

155
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,600
If I didn't plan it and spent a lot of money

156
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,040
to make the tenants next to her house move out,

157
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,230
do you think Lu Mingming can move in that quickly?

158
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,200
I didn't know my little Hanghang was this competent and clever.

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,350
That's awesome.

160
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,100
Now that he's staying closer to her, do you think he'll manage to win her heart?

161
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,080
I think he'll make it.

162
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,890
I hope he comes around this time.

163
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,720
We'll be neighbors from now on.

164
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,570
Neighbors. Let's help each other out, then.

165
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,380
Don't be shy. You can come to me if there's anything.

166
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,840
No, not at all.

167
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,180
Have you unpacked? Do you need any help?

168
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,630
It's okay. I'm already familiar with things around here.

169
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,930
I just paid the utility bills. Why is there a power outage?

170
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,380
It's an old unit. I guess it's a wiring problem.

171
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,930
Where's the switch box?

172
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,240
What box?

173
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,530
Switch box.

174
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,400
I don't know.

175
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,970
Didn't you say you were familiar with this place already?

176
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,670
Let's find it.

177
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,320
Found it.

178
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,900
- Where?
- Over here.

179
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,600
So this is the switch box?

180
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,680
As expected, it tripped.

181
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,380
Just push it upward.

182
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,810
I'll do it.

183
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,930
That's pretty easy.

184
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,310
I learned a new skill.

185
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,430
Are you sure you can get used to this place?

186
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,280
I can search for other places for you to stay.

187
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,250
No need. It's troublesome.

188
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,400
I can adjust.

189
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Moreover, it's convenient to find you to talk about work if I stay here.

190
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,700
I guess it's easier to exploit me to work more.

191
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,810
All right, then. If there's nothing else, I'll just leave.

192
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,950
Have you eaten? Why don't we have a meal together?

193
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,410
I'm trying to lose weight.

194
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,350
No, you can't.

195
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,750
I mean, you're in the investment industry.

196
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,160
Why do you have to lose weight?

197
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
You don't eat when you lose weight.

198
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,520
What if you can't think well?

199
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,330
Since I've taught you a skill,

200
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,680
I can let you buy me a meal.

201
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,210
Okay.

202
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,980
My face?

203
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,910
What's wrong with my face?

204

Not bad. You did well at haggling prices.

213
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,380
The company hasn't started making money.

214
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,450
So we must save as much as possible.

215
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,580
It's hard to get a ride here. There are more than 100 people in the queue.

216
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,250
Do you know how to ride a bicycle?

217
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,350
Yes.

Enough. Stop jumping. I'll do it.

233
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,940
Why do you keep doing my chores?

234
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,740
This chore isn't for a short person.

235
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,860
Do you know how to get rid of the glue?

236
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,080
Let me use your hand cream.

237
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,540
You knew?

238
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,420
Here.

239
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,550
Did you secretly sign up for a housekeeping class behind my back?

240
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,120
Well, not to that extent.

241
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,330
I learned something from Old Ning.

242
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,570
What did he teach you?

243
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,210
He told me to be nicer to you.

244
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,540
Do you think we can see our old office from here?

245
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,010
Yeah.

246
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,490
It's over there.

247
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,710
Where? Over there.

248
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,810
The second building on the right.

249
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
I think that's the food delivery.

250
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,120
I'll go and get it.

251
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,160
I think you're at the wrong place. I didn't order this much.

252
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,760
No, it's the right place.

253
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,390
Song?

254
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,690
Mr. Lu?

255
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,920
Yes, it's me.

256
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,920
Why are you delivering food now?

257
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,980
The Maybach was sold.

258
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,880
So I thought about practicing on an electric bike first.

259
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,240
Mr. Lu, is the new company hiring?

260
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm good at riding an electric bike now.

261
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,220
Song?

262
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,140
Ning Meng?

263
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,590
You...

264
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,190
Xiaoyang's special brewed coffee is here!

265
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,160
Xiaoyang?

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,370
Ning Meng!

267
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,320
So this is your new company?

268
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,010
Don't you think it's lacking something?

269
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,850
You lack a lively and lovely chairman's secretary who can make good coffee.

270
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,970
I have my resume prepared, too.

271
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,330
Ms. Ning. Mr. Lu. Please go through it.

272
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,360
Mine is here.

273
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,270
Please take a look.

274
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,500
I can help Mr. Lu and Ms. Ning screen these candidates.

275
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,070
Mr. Liu?

276
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,630
Xiaoyang? Song?

277
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,860
You're here, too? What a coincidence.

278
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,830
I was thinking about recruiting employees quickly since the new company is set up.

279
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,310
I didn't expect you all to be here.

280
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,130
That means we were thinking of the same thing.

281
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,580
It's better to say the hearts of those

282
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,350
from the same company are linked.

283
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,840
That's right.

284
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,940
You can keep putting up the act.

285
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,490
I think the three of you had planned this earlier on.

286
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,580
Well, not three but four.

287
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,170
Ren Pengfei said he'd be right over after he took care of the project in his hand.

288
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:11,210
He even said to leave the position of the Director of the Project Department for him.

289
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,610
Ms. Ning. Mr. Lu. Please let us stay.

290
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,020
We'll work hard.

291
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,600
Thank you. I'm truly thankful.

292
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,750
Xiaoyang, don't just stand there.

293
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,870
Go and sweep the floor. Roger that.

294
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,130
Song, that table is in the way. Take care of it.

295
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,920
Okay.

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,120
I'll go and help out.

297
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm on board now.

298
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,310
Don't just stand there.

299
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,060
Get back to work.

300
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,600
Let's go.

301
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,940
Mr. Liu, bring a dry cloth and a pail.

302
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,410
Okay.

303
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,410
Let me do it.

304
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,130
You're snatching my chores again.

305
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,410
Add some water.

306
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,100
Okay, wipe it.

307
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

308
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,560
It's ready now.

309
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,570
Dig in.

310
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,940
Wait.

311
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,710
Mr. Lu and Ms. Ning should eat first.

312
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,970
Just eat.

313
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,280
I'll dig in first.

314
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,190
Here. Have some vegetables.

315
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,460
Thank you.

316
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,080
By the way, what's our new company's name?

317
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,840
Let's just name it Joint Capital.

318
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,200
I think a new company should have a new name

319
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,560
to have a new beginning.

320
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,070
I've thought about its name.

321
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,020
I'll call it Lu Meng.

322
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,960
"Lu" from the word path and "Meng" from the word alliance.

323
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,000
Wait. Why didn't you use your last name and Ning Meng's first name?

324
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,670
Xiaoyang, can't you be more professional as a secretary?

325
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,310
You can't spread gossip.

326
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,980
Lu Meng means

327
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,310
heroes from all paths come to form an alliance.

328
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,830
That's good. This is meaningful.

329
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,720
It's a very meaningful name.

330
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,700
I'm truly thankful that you believe in me

331
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,780
and want to accompany me to start from zero.

332
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,130
That's not right.

333
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,310
I mean we have to start with having debts.

334
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,020
This may not be the first time I set up a company.

335
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,810
But it feels completely different from before.

336
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,820
I fell once.

337
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,560
It was horrible and painful.

338
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,170
But this fall awakened me

339
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:05,120
to let me know how I should walk my path in the future.

340
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,670
Thank you for staying beside me.

341
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,220
It made me realize

342
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,700
that there are more valuable and precious things

343
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,430
other than profits in the capital market.

344
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,510
For instance, comradeship...

345
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,100
and dreams.

346
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,540
Thank you. Here.

347
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,960
To Lu Meng!

348
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,290
- To Lu Meng!
- Drink to Lu Meng!

349
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,480
For success!

350
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,820
<i>[L&M Capital]</i>

351
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,470
<i>[Content set up - convenient service terminal]</i>
This is the industry

352
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,110
our company will focus on in the future.

353
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,680
Ms. Ning and I think

354
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,820
the future of a smart community is promising.

355
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,840
We can integrate the resources we have to the maximum.

356
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,610
I've sent out the proposal to Mr. Tang of Kirin Furniture,

357
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,140
Mr. Lin of Mobi, and Ms. Liu of Lehui.

358
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,820
They're very interested in it.

359
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,780
Home appliances and household products are all

360
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,030
in the industrial chain of the smart community.

361
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,800
They can complement each other.

362
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,360
The only thing we lack right now is our capital advantage.

363
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,640
Major LPs overlook small companies like ours,

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,090
while minor LPs don't have enough funds.

365
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,540
Also, it's hard to manage.

366
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,370
But don't ever underestimate such an amount of money.

367
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,330
A small amount can add up.

368
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,430
Why don't we think of it this way?

369
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,030
Major LPs may have a lot of funds.

370
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,000
But they also have a very high demand for returns.

371
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,520
But minor LPs are more patient

372
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,640
in waiting for the development of a project.

373
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,810
A smart community is a new concept.

374
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,790
It's not a project that will bring profits right away.

375
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,050
Instead, it'll need us to help it grow.

376
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,900
Moreover, our company has only started.

377
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,610
Making more friends means more connections.

378
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,330
I know several business owners.

379
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,460
I can try and talk to them.

380
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,330
Mr. Lu, not only can I recruit the workforce

381
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,420
but I can also help you attract funding.

382
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,370
Mr. Liu, you're just like a fortune cat.

383
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,880
All right. That's all for today's meeting.

384
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,630
Xiaoyang, sort out the financial statements of the previous quarter.

385
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,060
Okay, no problem, Ms. Ning.

386
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,150
Ning Meng, there's some development on that matter.

387
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,970
At the end of the trading day yesterday,

388
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,090
Nanlin's share price was moved up.

389
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,730
The trend was very strange.

390
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,170
So the manipulator has made its move.

391
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,110
After lying in wait for so long, they finally give themselves away.

392
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,920
What's your plan?

393
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,910
I've met Ms. Huang.

394
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,690
She is particularly interested in our concept of environmental protection.

395
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,000
She said she'd let us manage the smart community project

396
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,070
if we had enough funds.

397
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,040
Come in.

398
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,240
Ms. Ning, I need you to sign this document.

399
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,960
<i>[Su Weiran: I heard you started a company with Lu Jiming? Are you dating him?]</i>

400

<i>[Chang'an Guesthouse]</i>

402
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,230
<i>We're working on the funds.</i>

403
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,190
<i>So don't worry.</i>

404
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,190
<i>How did it go with Nanlin?</i>

405
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,310
I asked a bunch of friends to help me connect

406
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,230
with their Chief Financial Officer.

407
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm sure she knows about the company's operation.

408
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,910
<i>But there's a problem.</i>

409
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,730
She's resigning soon.

410
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,560
I don't think she's willing to take the risk.

411
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,560
I'll call her out tomorrow to talk about it.

412
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,920
Okay.

413
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,000
Are you used to staying at the guesthouse?

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,180
Yes.

415
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,050
What's there not to get used to?

416
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,900
Didn't we experience it

417
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,580
when we did our due diligence before?

418
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,490
There are many mosquitoes in Guangzhou.

419
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,760
Are there any at your place?

420
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,780
No. It's pretty good.

421
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,130
I'm glad to hear that.

422
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,890
All right, then. Rest early after you're done eating.

423
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,310
Okay. You too.

424
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,350
Good night.

425
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,180
Xiaoyang, is Mr. Lu back yet?

426
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,520
Meng, you've asked me three times already.

427
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,240
It's all Song's fault. Song!

428
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,120
You were supposed to pick him up at the airport. Why didn't you go?

429
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,420
Mr. Lu didn't let me.

430
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,160
He said he was taking the airport bus to save money.

431
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,940
Mr. Lu is different from before.

432
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,000
He never had to suffer when Joint Capital was still running.

433
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,310
Mr. Lu?

434
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,000
How was it?

435
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,280
<i>[Roasted Oysters. Chaozhou]</i>

436

<i>Mr. Lu, my resignation procedure is almost completed.</i>

437
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,220
<i>After the handover, I'll have nothing to do with this company anymore.</i>

438
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,780
<i>At this time, I don't want to have any trouble.</i>

439
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,300
<i>I can understand.</i>

440
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>But I assure you</i>

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,070
<i>that this matter won't get you involved.</i>

<i>Ms. Chen,</i>

<i>I'm sure you can't stand their despicable means either.</i>

444
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,800
<i>Otherwise, you wouldn't have resigned.</i>

445
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,000
<i>It's the same for me.</i>

446
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,070
<i>As someone in the profession of the capital industry,</i>

447
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,160
<i>be it from my personal perspective</i>

448
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,870
<i>or the industry's perspective,</i>

449
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,340
<i>I don't want to let these people continue to do evil.</i>

450
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,060
<i>According to Gresham's law, "bad money drives out good."</i>

<i>They should be the ones leaving,</i>

452
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,230
<i>not someone like you who has a bottom line.</i>

453
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,760
<i>So how can I help you?</i>

454
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,380
<i>I wonder if you can lend me</i>

455
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,590
<i>the drawer agreement between Nanlin's higher management and Caihuang Capital.</i>

456
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,610
<i>It's useless even if I give it to you.</i>

457
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,810
<i>Caihuang's owner is petty and cunning.</i>

458
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,360
<i>He'd never show up for something like this.</i>

459
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,900
<i>He entrusted it to his subordinate, Mr. Qiu.</i>

460
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,560
<i>Mr. Qiu?</i>

461
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,360
<i>Do you mean Qiu Junlin?</i>

462
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,900
Qiu Junlin has always been related to some despicable deeds.

463
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,940
That's right.

464
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,530
I still remember he made Ning Meng resign

465
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,150
to take over her project.

466
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,190
That's right. Mr. Lu tried to get rid of the evil.

467
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,510
So he scolded him and fired him. I felt so relieved.

468
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,710
I'll go and see him tomorrow.

469
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,210
With this agreement, he won't be able to deny it anymore.

470
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,780
I should go.

471
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,030
It'll be too eye-catching if you go to Caihuang Capital.

472
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,790
Moreover, Qiu Junlin looks down on me.

473
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,530
It's easier for him to let down his guard if he sees me.

474
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,210
To pull this off, everyone must play a part.

475
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,630
How about this? Tomorrow, everyone will have their own roles to play.

476
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,040
Mr. Qiu, Ms. Ning said she had an appointment with you.

477
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,880
So I let her wait for you in your office.

478
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,160
- Who?
- Ms. Ning.

479
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,590
Ms. Ning?

480
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,130
Ning Meng?

481
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,680
Hi, Mr. Qiu.

482
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,460
It's been a while.

483
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,350
What are you doing here?

484
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,590
To work with you.

485
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,230
You're doing better now, I see.

486
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,510
You look pretty decent now.

487
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,450
But based on our previous relationship, there's nothing for us to talk about.

488
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,090
See yourself out.

489
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,030
Mr. Qiu, I think you should decide after seeing this.

490
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,930
What's the meaning of this?

491
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,220
It means that you and Nanlin signed

492
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,680
this drawer agreement of stock price manipulation.

493
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,830
It must be Mr. Jin who authorized you to be the proxy

494
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,430
so he can avoid being at risk.

495
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,370
Ning Meng... I mean,

496
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,610
Ms. Ning. You're already a director.

497
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,720
Why are you still so narrow-minded?

498
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,190
Are you taking revenge on me out of resentment

499
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,400
because I pushed you out in the past?

500
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,560
Mr. Qiu, you're taking what happened to us very lightly

501
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,230
if you think of it this way. Why don't you expand the scope a little?

502
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,810
How should we expand it?

503
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,710
I want the evidence of Caihuang Capital, Shuangxun, and Renning colluding

504
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,040
to acquire Qinhe through improper means.

505
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,710
I don't know what you're talking about.

506
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,950
Mr. Qiu, your acting skills still suck after so long.

507
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,110
Fine.

508
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,400
Just report me.

509
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,240
I shall look forward to it.

510
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,640
Let's see what you can gain from me.

511
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,030
But if you do this, this matter will become serious.

512
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,400
The person who provided this information to you will suffer.

513
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,110
Listen to me.

514
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:25,640
You can't control everything.

515
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,660
<i>I can understand that we want to scare Qiu Junlin.</i>

516
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,330
<i>But what if he doesn't fall for it?</i>

517
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,750
<i>Can you please not jinx it?</i>

518
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,080
<i>He's right.</i>

519
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,350
<i>Qiu Junlin has been at Jin Haiyang's beck and call</i>

520
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,100
<i>and did so much dirty work for him.</i>

521
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,920
<i>If anything happens, I think Jin Haiyang will help him solve it.</i>

522
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,730
<i>He has someone to rely on.</i>

523
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,580
<i>He's not afraid since he has nothing to lose.</i>

524
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,400
<i>What do we do, then?</i>

525
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,000
<i>This agreement was not prepared for Qiu Junlin at all.</i>

526
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,680
See your way out.

527
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,920
Mr. Qiu, I think you've misunderstood something here.

528
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,460
I didn't prepare this agreement for you.

529
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,660
Mr. Jin is attending a finance forum.

530
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,700
He'll return soon.

531
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,380
<i>[Drawer Agreement]</i>
Say, if he sees that the share proportion

532
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:30,340
in this agreement is different from that in his hand,

533
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,970
what will happen, then?

534
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,530
If he knows you've signed a dual contract with Nanlin

535
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,390
and embezzled the difference in the margin,

536
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,920
you've embezzled a lot from him just from this agreement.

537
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,150
Will he be upset?

538
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,210
If he finds out you've been embezzling

539
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,470
so much of his money for every project,

540
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,290
do you think Mr. Jin will make his move

541
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:00,560
and push you off the cliff by making you a scapegoat

542
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,840
while washing his hands of this?

543
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:10,230
<i>How do you know if Qiu Junlin tampered with the agreement?</i>

544
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,920
<i>For Locke's project, he used the same method to set me up.</i>

545
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,730
<i>Qiu Junlin is greedy and a coward.</i>

546
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,260
<i>His head is filled with all those petty tricks.</i>

547
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,730
<i>I think he'll use this trick for life.</i>

548
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,270
<i>If Jin Haiyang finds out about this,</i>

549
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,870
<i>he'll be in serious trouble.</i>

550
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,510
Is your neck okay?

551
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,150
I slept the wrong way.

552
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,800
I'll let Mr. Jin go through the information

553
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,130
about your embezzlement when he comes back.

554
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,950
All right. Let's talk about our matters.

555
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,170
Wipe your sweat.

556
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,180
No need.

557
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,080
I wasn't involved in the acquisition of Qinhe.

558
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,140
I only had a meal with them.

559
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,200
That day, Mr. Jin Haiyang left first because he was busy.

560
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,990
I only stayed to entertain the rest.

561
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,580
You must understand that Jin Haiyang is petty and cunning.

562
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,510
He doesn't trust anyone.

563
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,270
He'd take care of something as lucrative as this in person.

564
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,640
I know that.

565
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,320
You were only using each other.

566
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,840
You're not close to the point of being best friends.

567
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,530
But speaking of which,

568
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:47,230
no one is as cunning as you.

569
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,940
I'm sure you've been collecting their criminal evidence, right?

570
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,990
That's your talisman to protect yourself.

571
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,330
You've done so many unspeakable things for Jin Haiyang.

572
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,470
Once they're exposed, you'll have to take the fall for him.

573
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:13,500
Yes, you did embezzle a lot of money.

574
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,790
But you can say it's your hard-earned money.

575
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,500
You have to take all the risks of breaking the law for this small amount of money.

576
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,740
Is it worth it?

577
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,940
Old Qiu, Jin Haiyang was in the wrong first.

578
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,220
It's only right for you to leave a way out for yourself.

579
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,880
As long as you can give me the evidence of their illegal operations,

580
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,960
I'll leave this here for your safety.

581
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,190
<i>Does Qiu Junlin really have evidence of their unlawful acquisition of Qinhe?</i>

582
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,530
<i>A petty person like him doesn't trust and guard against everyone.</i>

583
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,230
<i>If this drawer agreement isn't persuasive enough,</i>

584
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,960
<i>we can raise some stakes here.</i>

585
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,600
Let me think about it.

586
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,950
Okay. I'll let you think.

587
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,220
It'll be better if you make your decision before Jin Haiyang comes back.

588
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,940
Why did he leave early?

589
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,800
He really left. Oh no!

590
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,420
Hello, Mr. Lu. Jin Haiyang left the forum early.

591
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,320
<i>Don't panic. Find ways to stall him.</i>

592
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,700
<i>[Lu Jiming: Jin Haiyang is coming.]</i>

593
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,900
Mr. Qiu, are you done?

594
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,510
I need to think about it. Give me more time.

595
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,540
There's no need to be this troublesome anyway.

596
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,490
I can just file a complaint against you.

597
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,100
The police will do the interrogation for me.

598
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,920
But we wouldn't know if Jin Haiyang will save you

599
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,670
or betray you when that happens.

600
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,870
I'll look for it.

601
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,320
Don't get in the way.

602
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,870
Move to the other lane.

603
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,260
What's going on?

604
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,760
- Zhang?
- I don't know.

605
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,640
They're doing this on purpose.

606
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,740
Overtake them.

607
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,400
Pull over.

608
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,040
I said, pull over.

609
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,370
Can't you find it, Mr. Qiu?

610
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,320
I can't find my keys.

611
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,130
Mr. Jin. What a coincidence.

612
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,750
Lu Jiming?

613
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,610
What are you doing here?

614
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm here to discuss some projects.

615
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,750
Is that so?

616
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,520
I thought no one dared to work with you anymore.

617
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,500
Have you paid all your debts?

618
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,230
Almost.

619
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,930
Mr. Jin, I wonder if you have extra money to help me.

620
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,800
Now, this is unexpected.

621
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,220
Lu Jiming is asking for my help?

622
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,870
Okay. I'll have to think about this.

623
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,840
But you'll have to beg me.

624
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,740
Earnestly beg me.

625
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,550
Mr. Jin, why don't you hear about the projects I have in mind?

626
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,430
These big projects are suitable for you.

627
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,120
Tell me about them.

628
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,980
I found them.

629
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,170
I hope you'll stop harassing me in the future.

630
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,910
You have to promise me.

631
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,600
That will depend on your sincerity.

632
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,050
I don't ever want to see you again.

633
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,400
Add tiles to the Great Wall?

634
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,720
What nonsense is this?

635
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,600
You're sick.

636
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,220
Mr. Jin, there are other projects if you don't like this one.

637
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,730
Build guard rails along the Yellow River or add a switch for the sun. What do you think?

638
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,880
You're really out of your mind.

639
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,800
I think you're suitable for these projects.

640
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,670
You can gain profit without investing anything.

641
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,060
Lu Jiming, all you have left is the ability to talk glibly here.

642
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,000
Do you think you can do anything to me?

643
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,860
I can't do anything about you.

644
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,570
Mr. Jin, relax for a bit.

645
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,480
I was only kidding around.

646
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,830
We need to have a sense of humor. Am I right?

647
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,110
All right. I won't keep you any longer.

648
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,600
Please.

649
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,630
How did it go?

650
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,760
I got it.

651
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,620
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

652
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:45,190
♫ <i>That could predict when we meet?</i> ♫

653
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,200
♫ <i>Perhaps it's going to be a sight</i> ♫

654
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,870
♫ <i>If we could walk ahead of time</i> ♫

655
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,880
♫ <i>We refused to be defined, be discriminated</i> ♫

656
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,320
♫ <i>And be labeled</i> ♫

657
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,700
♫ <i>To be the best of me</i> ♫

658
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,510
♫ <i>To meet the best of you again</i> ♫

659
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:16,250
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

660
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,090
♫ <i>No matter how reluctant you feel</i> ♫

661
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,680
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫

662
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:31,430
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

663
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,390
♫ <i>Watching the fallen leaves, listening to the wind</i> ♫

664
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,070
♫ <i>Saying that all colors have luster</i> ♫

665
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,970
♫ <i>Don't want to be bullied, to be brushed off</i> ♫

666
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,370
♫ <i>And to be treated like a fool</i> ♫

667
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,600
♫ <i>Breaking through the laws of the world</i> ♫

668
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:09,350
♫ <i>And reconnect with the sacred heart</i> ♫

669
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:16,990
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

670
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,130
♫ <i>Every little thing we gain in life</i> ♫

671
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,400
♫ <i>Comes with huge obstacles</i> ♫

672
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:32,370
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

673
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,310
♫ <i>There's no so-called happy ending</i> ♫

674
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:40,170
♫ <i>Just make your decision bravely</i> ♫
