Mr. Zhang of Xiaoma Technology wants to meet Mr. Lu.</i>

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,150
<i>When can it be scheduled?</i>

3
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>[Qiu Junlin]
We've submitted the weekly report.</i>

4
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,000
<i>When will Mr. Lu give his feedback?</i>

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,470
<i>[Send]
All of the messages above have been duly noted.</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,870
<i>I'll follow up as soon as I reach the office.</i>

<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

Mr. Lu will be using a handheld microphone for tonight's award ceremony.

9
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,900
- There shouldn't be any problem down here, right?
- Absolutely no problem.

10
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,470
<i>[Accompany Mr. Lu to the award ceremony]</i>

11
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,270
Yes, Xiaoyang?

12
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,300
<i>Ning Meng, where are you?</i>

13
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,190
I went to pick up Mr. Lu's suits. What's the matter?

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,040
<i>What else can it be? A storm is brewing.</i>

15
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,140
<i>Come back quickly.</i>

16
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,290
All right. I'll be there right away.

17

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,351
Mr. Liu, are you crazy to show up here at this time?
<i>[Chairman]</i>

20
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,630
Where's Ning Meng?

21
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,530
I've rushed her. She'll be here soon.

22
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,150
<i>Liu Yitian! Do you think you deserve to use the toilet?</i>

23
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,710
Keep calling her.

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,960
Ning Meng, where are you now? Please come back now.

25
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,511
He's going to blow up anytime soon.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,670
All the terms were laid down

27
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,750
and all that was left was to sign the investment agreement.

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,220
How did it go wrong in your hands, Ren Pengfei?

29
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,000
Every one of you would brag about how competent you are.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,800
With the high success rates you have,

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,600
how did you end up being stood up?

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,160
Do guys prefer being second choice?

33
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,110
After both parties signed the agreement,

34
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,800
you'd even help to courier the documents.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,500
Is that what you want?

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,880
Mr. Lu, Tang Zhengwang didn't keep his word.

37
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,510
He could have told us if he wasn't happy with the terms.

38
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,080
We were caught off guard when he changed his mind at the last minute.

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,910
It was really hard for us to predict this.

40
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,993
- Do you think we can find another project...
- Another project?

41
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,380
So all of our market due diligence was all for nothing?

42
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,220
What's Kirin's Furniture's selling point?

43
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,750
Environmentally friendly home furniture.

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,951
If you can find another company that's better

45
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:34,720
than Qilin's Furniture in this aspect, you can take my post.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,153
Find it!

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,100
- Mr. Lu, I'll think of something.
- Think of what?

48
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,661
It'll be too late by the time you think of something.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,630
Ning Meng, there you are.

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,550
I delivered coffee twice but he sent me out twice.

51
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,110
He said it wasn't hot enough and too sweet.

52
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,800
We can't do anything without you here.

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,240
What happened?

54
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,750
Didn't Mr. Lu try to invest in Kirin's Furniture?

55
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,651
We don't know why Mr. Tang contacted

56
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:10,800
an investment company called Caihuang Capital behind our backs.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,320
He insisted on investing with Jin Haiyang and got rid of us.

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,070
Mr. Lu had given all the resources to them.

59
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,110
But someone else reaped what he sowed.

60
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,110
Mr. Ren was unaware and didn't get wind of this.

61
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,670
That's why Mr. Lu is livid.

62
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,070
<i>You guys are unbelievable.</i>

63
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,370
<i>Even a roasted duck can fly now!</i>

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,660
Roasted duck.

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,710
He's upset to the point where he doesn't speak properly now.

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,000
Meng, the meeting with the bank is in 30 minutes.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,850
Do you think we can still have the meeting?

68
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,263
Yes.

69
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,640
This darn Tang Zhengwang.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,770
He's not answering my call because he did something wrong!

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,030
Mr. Lu, Mr. Tang's secretary, Luan, told me that Mr. Tang has been ill.

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,070
Could it be that he didn't notice your call?

73
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,610
Ill? I think he's seriously ill.

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
And I didn't ask you. Get out.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,160
All right.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,960
Wait.

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,220
I'm thirsty. Get me something to drink.

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,640
- Do you want tea or coffee?
- Tea.

79
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,990
- Hot or iced?
- Iced.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,540
- Sugar or milk?
- Milk.

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,973
All right.

82
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,600
Mr. Lu, your tea.

83
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,270
I didn't say I wanted tea.

84
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,700
I said I wanted coffee.

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,750
I made it according to your request. You wanted hot coffee with sugar.

86
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,950
It's from the same batch of Ethiopian coffee beans.

87
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,650
The taste is the same.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,740
Sirs, what do you want to drink?

89
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,880
They don't deserve to drink.

90
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,250
Their heads are filled with water. They're not thirsty at all.

91
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,400
- Are you thirsty?
- No, we're not.

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,580
We're not thirsty at all.

93
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,370
Mr. Lu, this is the financial statement for the new quarter.

94
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,710
This is the event itinerary for tonight's annual investor's award ceremony and guestlists.

95
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,060
There are several of them you wanted to meet before.

96
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,950
Mr. Lu, there's a meeting in the conference room later.

97
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,320
It was a meeting with the bank we arranged a week ago.

98
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,130
They'll be here any minute now.

99
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,340
Why don't I tell them to wait until you're done with the affairs here?

100
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,520
Ning Meng, are you getting ahead of yourself

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,200
and making the decisions for me?

102
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,160
Who told you I wanted to take care of the affairs here first?

103
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,653
Also, don't just stand there and do nothing.

104
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:54,720
I want each of you to prepare an analysis report about this matter

105
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,820
and give it to me before you get off work.

106
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on, let's go.

107
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,600
Mr. Qiu. Mr. Ren.

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,220
Old Ren, what happened?

109
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,380
Isn't this your department's project?

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,170
What does that have to do

111
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,760
with Old Liu, the Administrative Director, and me in this matter?

112
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,480
No matter how close we are,

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,390
we shouldn't get reprimanded together. Am I right?

114
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,730
Sorry, guys. It's my fault.

115
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,330
I'll buy you a meal another day, okay?

116
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,990
We're all directors of this company.

117
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,670
It's humiliating to be scolded every day like this.

118
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,820
Mr. Lu has a bad temper.

119
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,710
But he has good foresight.

120
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,180
He made his first pot of gold when he joined the industry by investing in a project.

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,610
- He can't tolerate any failures when he's used to consecutive successes.
- You're right.

122
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,160
We'll just put up with it, then. Joint Capital offered us a high annual salary.

123
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,040
Why? It's to compensate us for mental damage.

124
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,970
Look. Without Ning Meng, we wouldn't have survived today.

125
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,150
My foresight is also good. Am I right?

126
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,550
Ning Meng already has Mr. Lu within her grasp.

127
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,640
<i>[HR Director]</i>
No secretary could last for three months.

128
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,360
Look at her. She's been here for three years.

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,070
- That means you have a unique vision.
- Stop it.

130
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
- It's true.
- Not at all.

131
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,880
If Ning Meng were taller and more beautiful,

132
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,630
she wouldn't be a secretary anymore. Am I right?

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,073
Who is she, then?

134
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,680
Lady Boss.

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,933
What?

136
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,280
Mr. Lu, why don't you just fire Mr. Ren?

137
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Why should I fire him?

138
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,900
He let the information leak out.

139
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,001
He failed to predict why Tang Zhengwang changed his mind at the last minute.

140
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,681
How can a person not think from all angles when it comes to investment?

141
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,860
One has to be brave and a visionary at the same time.

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,810
There's always a way to keep things from you.

143
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,630
Why are you upset with Mr. Ren, then?

144
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,270
Are you mocking me?

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,140
Put that pretense away from your face.

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,170
Someone without a keen insight can't be an investor.

147
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,830
So why did you think Tang Zhengwang suddenly changed his mind?

148
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,320
There are no other issues in this project.

149
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,980
We can only assume

150
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,760
that Jin Haiyang from Caihuang Capital has offered a higher price.

151
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,370
- By the way, are you close to Tang Zhengwang's secretary?
- Pretty close.

152
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,550
I want you to find her to get some information from her.

153
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,540
Do you know what to say?

154
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,500
I'll just play it by ear.

155
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,570
<i>[Chairman]</i>

156
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,000
Have some water.

157
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Meng, I'm very curious.

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,280
How do you know how to handle Mr. Lu?

159
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,640
He said he wanted tea. How did you know he wanted coffee?

160
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,470
This is what Mr. Lu is like.

161
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,020
He likes guessing games and saying things he didn't mean.

162
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
I get it. Just do the opposite of what he says. Wait, that's not right.

163
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,250
There are times he wanted to have tea when he said he wanted it.

164
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,080
Analyze according to the situation.

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,780
- You're a god.
- I have no choice.

166
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,590
It comes from countless experiences.

167
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,740
Meng, it's been three years.

168
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,300
It must be hard on you.

169
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,440
Yes.

170
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,080
But I think this will all be over for me soon.

171
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,730
It's my last day as secretary.

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,740
I have to go now. The bankers are coming. Go and receive them.

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,633
Last day?

174
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,113
Hey, Luan.

175
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:38,110
There you are. Sit.

176
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,030
The valuation given by Caihuang Capital is indeed higher than ours.

177
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,440
But Ms. Luan is not sure how much.

178
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
I think it must be tempting.

179
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Otherwise, Tang Zhengwang wouldn't have taken the chance of offending you

180
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,670
by changing his mind at the last minute.

181
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,960
I know how Jin Haiyang of Caihuang Capital works.

182
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,470
He'll start with a long-winding story and talk excitedly

183
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,270
to bluff the entrepreneurs all the time.

184
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,870
As far as I know,

185
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,790
he used this method of offering high prices to win projects before.

186
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,670
But it's all talk with not much success.

187
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,840
What should we do, then?

188
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,290
Do we need to increase our valuation?

189
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,300
How many years has Ms. Luan worked for Tang Zhengwang?

190
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,183
Three years.

191
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,640
Like me, it's been three years.

192
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,913
Luan.

193
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,330
He's going to sign it today?

194
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,880
All right. I understand.

195
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,813
Thank you, Luan.

196
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,590
Tang Zhengwang is too impatient.

197
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,110
He said he was going to sign it with Jin Haiyang next week.

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,710
We would still have time to do something about it.

199
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,871
Why did he suddenly reschedule it to today?

200
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,220
Did Mr. Tang contact you?

201
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,963
No.

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,590
"He's now at The Peninsula Hotel.

203
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,080
He'll be going to Jinyu Club from there.

204
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,610
It'll take about half an hour."

205
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,400
We must reach the hotel before 3:00 to stop Tang Zhengwang.

206
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,840
Or else, it'll be too late.

207
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,140
Song, drive a little faster.

208
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,933
All right.

209
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,230
Mr. Tang, they're here.

210
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,230
I'll go and meet them.

211
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,890
Okay. Sure.

212
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,520
This way, please.

213
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,153
Mr. Tang.

214
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,883
Where's Mr. Lu?

215
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,060
He thought you didn't want to see him because you didn't answer his calls.

216
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,260
So he sent me here alone.

217
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,860
Please have a seat.

218
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,480
So when it comes to making a decision on this project,

219
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,400
Ms. Ning, can you make the decision?

220
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,260
Of course, I can't.

221
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,210
But it doesn't affect anything

222
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,960
because Mr. Lu doesn't have plans to increase the valuation.

223
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,440
<i>[Half an hour ago]</i>

224
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,730
Did you say Ms. Luan has worked for Tang Zhengwang for three years?

225
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,293
Yes.

226
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,130
That means she's not a newcomer.

227
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,100
How could she casually tell you their trade secrets?

228
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,760
What time they're signing and where her boss is,

229
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,860
as if they're afraid you don't know.

230
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,400
Even if you have a close relationship,

231
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
she can't be this negligent in her work. Right?

232
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,030
Are you saying they're putting up an act?

233
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,030
Tang Zhengwang told her to tell me these?

234
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,030
Tang Zhengwang never intended to give up on cooperating with us.

235
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,730
He was confused by others, thinking he could get a higher valuation.

236
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,910
Since he sent his secretary to deal with this,

237
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,400
my secretary can't lose to others now, can she?

238
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,180
Is this Mr. Lu's intention?

239
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,670
Mr. Lu said if we were investing in this project,

240
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,220
we'd invest according to his valuation.

241
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,610
The valuation we've offered is already the highest within a reasonable range.

242
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,763
Do you think there's a possibility that you've misheard him?

243
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,780
No, I mean,

244
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,330
is there no room...

245
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,980
for further negotiation?

246
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,480
Mr. Tang, I'm only here to relay his message.

247
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,940
But you're right. It's not up to a sectary like me

248
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,480
to make such decisions on these big projects.

249
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,030
Why don't you call and ask Mr. Lu now if this is the case now?

250
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,860
The thing is, Mr. Lu is getting ready for an important award ceremony tonight.

251
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,965
He especially instructed me not to waste his time and energy on other things.

252
00:16:23,965 --> 00:16:27,035
But this isn't a small matter, is it not?

253
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,595
Mr. Lu's temper is pretty...

254
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:31,615
It's difficult on my side.

255
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,425
Ms. Luan, we're in the same field.

256
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,925
So please don't make it hard for me.

257
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:44,738
- Mr. Tang, Mr. Lu respects every entrepreneur's opinions.
- Yes.

258
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,345
So he wishes you and Mr. Jin to enjoy working together.

259
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,295
- I'll take my leave.
- Okay.

260
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,425
No. Wait.

261
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:59,125
Did Mr. Lu say anything else other than that?

262
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,025
I mean, is there anything else?

263
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:05,125
- I almost forgot.
- What is it?

264
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,945
He wants me to tell you that he wants

265
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,725
a win-win situation with the entrepreneurs he invested in.

266
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,585
He wants to make the same amount of money together,

267
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:16,738
which is more important than splitting the pie.

268
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,705
I'll take my leave if there's nothing else.

269
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,375
Ms. Luan, you don't have to see me off.

270
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,008
See you.

I heard you've invested in home furnishings, right?

Is it possible for you to leave some for me?

297
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:58,345
Mr. Jin, you must love home so much

298
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:01,225
to have such preference towards home furniture.

299

- Mr. Wang, how do you do?
- Mr. Lu.

300
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:08,495
Why? Have you already invested in a similar field?

301
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:10,625
Mr. Wang, didn't you hear

302
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,095
that Mr. Jin offered a very high valuation

303
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:16,155
for Mr. Tang Zhengwang of Kirin's Furniture. He was really sincere.

<i>Is that so? I...</i>

305
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,785
In that case, we'll be competitors.

00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,505
I guess you can forget about my project.

307
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:27,335
Mr. Wang, I'm still considering whether to cooperate with Tang Zhengwang.

308
00:20:27,335 --> 00:20:30,645
Mr. Jin, I didn't know you had already settled your capital chain issues.

309
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,095

Has the company you invested in solved their cash flow crisis?

313
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:44,695
It'll be troublesome if they don't change.

00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:47,545
It's better to invest in industries if you ask me.

315
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,135
As they say, it's prosperous.

316
00:20:49,135 --> 00:20:53,085
- It's unethical to exploit retail investors.
- I agree.

317
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,135
Mr. Wang, you're right.

318
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:59,025
- How about we schedule a time...
- Mr. Wang, the ceremony is about start.

319
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,905
- I'll send you back to your seat.
- Okay. Mr. Wang.

320
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:02,585
Let's meet up some time, Mr. Wang.

321
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,785
<i>The award ceremony is about to start. Please have a seat.
- Mr. Lu, you're indeed young and promising.</i>

322
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,018
<i>- Have a seat.
- Right.</i>

323
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,625
<i>Did you enjoy that?</i>

324
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,268
Yes.

325
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,975
It's going to start now. I'm hanging up.

326
00:21:12,975 --> 00:21:14,508
Okay.

327
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,495
Forge ahead. Build the future.

328
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:23,585
To all ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

329
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,735
I'm tonight's host, Wang Jue.

330
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:28,495
I'm honored that all of you can join our awards ceremony.

331
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:36,015
Next, I'll announce tonight's New Forces Awards ceremony begins officially.

332
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,135
Song, thank you.

333
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,615
It's nothing.

334
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,605
Why don't you go home first? Tell Mr. Lu that you'll take time off.

335
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,725
I must complete my last task.

336
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,675
I'll head back first, okay?

337
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:09,335
Next, the company that won the New Forces Award is Joint Capital.

338
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:11,785
Let us give a round of applause and invite the founder,

339
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:15,135
Mr. Lu Jiming, to the stage to receive his award.

340
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:24,785
At the same time, let's invite the award presenter, Mr. Yang Weixin.

341
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:33,585
Thank you to our award presenter.

342
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,155
You may take your seat.

343
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,665
Mr. Lu, please stay.

344
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:42,095
Next, we shall invite Mr. Lu to share his investment philosophy.

345
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,845
Let's give him a round of applause.

346
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:54,055
First and foremost, I'd like to thank those who walked with me and my seniors.

347
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:56,925
Joint Capital has run for five years.

348
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:03,305
To receive such an award, my team and I feel very honored.

349
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:08,415
I think it's an art related to people when it comes to investment.

350
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:12,555
I especially like the word "crowd."

351
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:15,325
There are people on your left

352
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,355
and right in the crowd.

353
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:20,095
It looks as if they're walking together on the same road,

354
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,115
which becomes a "crowd."

355
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:25,295
I can say one of them is an investor

356
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:27,635
while the other is the entrepreneur.

357
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:32,725
As long as these two types of people share the same faith and goal,

358
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:37,205
they can create a lively crowd.

359
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:39,038
Thank you all.

360
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,670
<i>[Accompany Mr. Lu to the award ceremony]</i>

361
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:54,765
Mr. Lu, three years ago today...

362
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,820
<i>[To Lu Jiming]</i>

363
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,860
<i>[Mr. Lu, three years ago today, I had the honor of joining Joint Capital]</i>

364
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,255
<i>[as your secretary. Thank you for raising me for the past three years.]</i>

365
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,605
Raising?

366
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:10,740
Wrong word.

367
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,995
<i>[Acknowledging]</i>

368
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,220
Acknowledging.

369
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,220
<i>[Lu XX]</i>

370
00:25:19,105 --> 00:25:22,035
- Yes, Mr. Lu.
<i>- I'm done. Where are you?</i>

371
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:24,275
I'm in the lounge. I'll go to you now.

372
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:27,905
<i>Ning Meng, make a restaurant reservation, and let's have dinner.</i>

373
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,425
Okay. How many people will be joining?

374
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:31,905
Just the two of us.

375
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,318
Okay.

376
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:47,238
Order the food.

377
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,395
Buttermilk cod,

378
00:25:54,395 --> 00:25:58,235
low-temperature smoked steak, potato dumplings, salad Kiev,

379
00:25:58,235 --> 00:25:59,885
and Borscht soup.

380
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:03,115
Don't add peas in the salad and no onions in the Borscht soup.

381
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:04,948
That's all.

382
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:11,115
You remember very well what I eat.

383
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:13,445
I've been working for you for three years, after all.

384
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:15,345
Exactly three years.

385
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:19,335
Yes, three years.

386
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:24,405
It's been a long time. So I guess you're an experienced secretary now.

387
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:29,325
Mr. Lu, you haven't forgotten

388
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:32,695
what day it is today since you've invited me for dinner tonight.

389
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:36,516
- What day is it?
- It's April 1st.

390
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:39,638
April Fools?

391
00:26:40,425 --> 00:26:42,065
Not only that.

392
00:26:42,065 --> 00:26:44,575
Three years ago today...

393
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,218
Mr. Lu.

394
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,835
Enjoy your dinner.

395
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,755
For you.

396
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:54,975
What's this?

397
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:58,115
How can I forget what day today is?

398
00:26:58,115 --> 00:26:59,825
It's a gift for you.

399
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:03,685
I wish you an April Fools day.

400
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:05,495
I can't accept this.

401
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:08,885
Why not? You deserve it.

402
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:18,685
Mr. Lu, you're giving me a bag, flowers, and cakes...

403
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:21,885
Those flowers and cake have nothing to do with me.

404
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,735
I'm giving you this bag as a reward.

405
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:29,485
You're the secretary of a top ten New Force investor from today on.

406
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:33,555
You should have a decent bag when you go out, right?

407
00:27:34,705 --> 00:27:37,235
<i>Dear Linlin, marry me.</i>

408
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,925
Marry him! Marry him!

409
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,815
Remember to reserve a private room when I eat out next time.

410
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:47,935
- They're so noisy.
<i>- Marry him! Marry him!</i>

411
00:27:49,785 --> 00:27:54,455
Mr. Lu, I want to tell you something.

412
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,108
What is it?

413
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:04,015
Ning Meng, look.

414
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:09,205
What makes me admire you the most is that you have never had any delusions about me.

415
00:28:09,205 --> 00:28:11,375
You must keep this up.

416
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:18,955
This isn't what you wanted to say?

417
00:28:20,185 --> 00:28:21,785
All right, what is it?

418
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:24,978
Mr. Lu,

419
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,625
I don't want to be a secretary anymore.

420
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,915
I want to transfer to the Project Department.

421
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,685
Say that again?

422
00:28:35,685 --> 00:28:38,325
When I interviewed at your company,

423
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,605
I was interviewing to work in the Project Department.

424
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:43,135
But something went wrong in between and I became your secretary.

425
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:45,235
Something went wrong?

426
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:49,035
It was a god-given opportunity.

427
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:53,115
Since it's an opportunity, why do you want to leave?

428
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:57,885
Ning Meng, this field changes all the time.

429
00:28:57,885 --> 00:29:00,515
Plans can never keep up with changes.

430
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,805
Mr. Lu, I know it's April Fool's day today.

431
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:05,215
But you can't fool me like a fool.

432
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,255
Wait, we're just having a chat.

433
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:09,105
Why are you so anxious?

434
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,235
Okay, how about this?

435
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:17,735
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Liu Yitian.

436
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:20,615
After we renew your agreement, I'll double your pay.

437
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,485
That's not it.

438
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:26,725
I have no interest in working as a secretary.

439
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,965
Mr. Liu told me to stay by your side so I could learn how to run projects.

440
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:32,376
After he finds a suitable secretary, he'll transfer me.

441
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:35,495
But he delayed it for three years.

442
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:39,685
Ning Meng, you're wrong about yourself.

443
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:44,095
The truth has proven that you're born with the talent as a secretary.

444
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,735
Besides, I think highly of you.

445
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:48,845
I even bought a bag for you.

446
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:51,685
No secretary lives as comfortably as you.

447
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:53,995
Lives comfortably?

448
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:57,615
You only make coffee,

449
00:29:57,615 --> 00:29:59,615
send documents, and make calls.

450
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:02,525
Even a chimpanzee with a higher IQ can do all those with a little training.

451
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:05,355
Can a chimpanzee answer calls?

452
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:07,905
I don't mean to mock you.

453
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:13,645
Ning Meng, it's already not bad to have such a salary

454
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,485
based on your current workload.

455
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,215
Look at the whole industry.

456
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,425
Which position is as relaxing as yours?

457
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,965
Relaxing?

458
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:23,415
It's not relaxing at all.

459
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:26,705
Yes, you have to work overtime sometimes.

460
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:29,035
But you only make calls and send messages via WeChat.

461
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,155
That's not taxing at all.

462
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:51,568
Mr. Lu, we can't come to an agreement here today,

463
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,585
I need you to follow me somewhere.

464
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,635
Where?

465
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:58,168
- My house.
- Your house? Why?

466
00:30:58,168 --> 00:30:59,845
You'll know when you get there.

467
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Is this some kind of a trick?

468
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:07,805
Mr. Lu, I've never asked you for anything after so long.

469
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:10,605
I only have this one request today.

470
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:14,978
Okay, I'll go.

471
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,255
I didn't have any wine today anyway.

472
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:18,788
Let's go.

473
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,020
<i>[Puxi Apartment]</i>

474
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:37,805
Mr. Lu, should I wait here or should I pick you up at a certain time?

475
00:31:37,805 --> 00:31:40,355
Of course, wait here.

476
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:44,485
Mr. Lu, I don't know anything. Don't worry.

477
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,015
What are you talking about?

478
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:51,448
Remember. If I don't come down after one hour, call the police.

479
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:54,755
Mr. Lu, you forgot the bag.

480
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:09,535
The living environment here is bad.

481
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:11,168
We're here.

482
00:32:13,355 --> 00:32:16,105
Why did you want me to come here?

483
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:22,335
Put these slippers on. What can you see from there?

484
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:23,875
Come in and take a look.

485
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,225
It's so troublesome to take off my shoes.

486
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:34,165
Ning Meng, your house is a mess.

487
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,755
It doesn't look like the home of a lady.

488
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,755
Why didn't you clean up?

489
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,205
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu. I forgot you like things clean.

490
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:41,615
Is it an eyesore to you?

491
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:43,815
You'll have to put up with it for a while.

492
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:47,595
You also think it doesn't look like the house of a lady. Am I right?

493
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:49,550
Take a closer look.

494
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:52,038
Look here.

495
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,508
Over there.

496
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:56,398
Your documents.

497
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,775
Your itinerary memos.

498
00:32:58,775 --> 00:33:01,705
Your work schedule.

499
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,555
All these are the gifts you want to give to the clients.

500
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:08,805
Over there are your shirts and pants.

501
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:11,105
Usually, I tidy everything nicely during the day.

502
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:13,995
One call from you in the middle of the night, I have to redo everything.

503
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,685
How is this a home?

504
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:19,395
This is another office of mine with a small bed for me to take a short rest.

505
00:33:19,395 --> 00:33:22,315
Ning Meng, taking your work home

506
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,425
means you're not that efficient at work.

507
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:28,255
These suits have been dry cleaned for days.

508
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:30,445
I didn't tell you to keep them at your place.

509
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:32,155
Why didn't you keep them at the company?

510
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,055
What do you think?

511
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:39,278
These are Mr. Lu's instruction manuals.

512
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,275
Yours are more complicated than the space shuttle.

513
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,915
Eight things to note for dry cleaning.

514
00:33:44,915 --> 00:33:47,665
Thirteen things to note when making coffee.

515
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,715
Twenty-one for daily food and drinks.

516
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:51,635
Thirty-eight things to note when working out of town.

517
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:53,705
I'm your secretary during the day.

518
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:55,395
After work, I become your nanny.

519
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:59,705
When you're drunk at night, a girl like me has to drive for you in the middle of the night.

520
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:02,155
Yes, you like things to be neat and clean. You don't like people to enter your home.

521
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,855
Do you have to give me so much trouble?

522
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:06,565
Are you done? I don't like hearing this.

523
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,555
I'm not done talking. Just listen.

524
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:11,535
I'm on call for 24 hours.

525
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:13,205
You'll be upset if I don't answer your call within three seconds.

526
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:15,915
You'll get upset if I don't answer your call in the middle of the night.

527
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,645
Can't I live my life?

528
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:21,305
Can't I rest when I'm not well?

529
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,645
I'm also a human!

530
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,055
I'm not an AI robot.

531
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:30,335
What does that tell you?

532
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,315
It shows you put your heart into your work.

533
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:35,205
You're a good secretary.

534
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:38,875
That's why I bought a bag for you as a reward.

535
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,095
Why are you venting your anger at me?

536
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:44,015
Even if you buy me ten of these bags, they'll only contain your things.

537
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,845
I don't even have my own life anymore.

538
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:51,635
Mr. Lu, I've always wanted to be in the Project Department.

539
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:55,705
If I continue to be your secretary, I'll be completely hopeless.

540
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:58,906
Even if I work for another company, no one will let me work on a project anymore.

541
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:01,985
You can just continue to be my secretary.

542
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:05,575
I do admire you but only at the level

543
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:07,835
of you being my secretary.

544
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:10,785
If I transfer you to the Project Department.

545
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:14,265
Then I don't know what your purpose in Joint Capital is anymore.

546
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,975
That's a very harsh thing to say.

547
00:35:18,975 --> 00:35:20,605
Are you looking down on me?

548
00:35:20,605 --> 00:35:23,605
At least, I've graduated with a finance background.

549
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:26,395
I know. You're in the right field.

550
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:33,005
- What are you doing?
- Look at these.

551
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:39,075
Venture capital? Everybody has this.

552
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:41,645
What do you want to prove by showing me these?

553
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:44,845
Do you know how many finance graduates are produced every year?

554
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:47,125
Do you think every one of them can succeed in investment?

555
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:50,405
That's because I never had the chance.

556
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:54,795
I've told you everything tonight. But you were not listening at all.

557
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:57,095
I'll say this one last time.

558
00:35:57,095 --> 00:35:59,895
I don't want to work as a secretary anymore!

559
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:02,425
Who gives you the right to yell at me?

560
00:36:02,425 --> 00:36:04,095
Are you rebelling against me?

561
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,585
Ning Meng, I'll just be frank with you.

562
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,485
You want to be part of Joint Capital's project?

563
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:15,685
You can just dream or wait until your next life!

564
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:27,125
Get me some water.

565
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,475
I'm all thirsty because you drive me up to the wall.

566
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:33,575
Go.

567
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:44,735
What is that thing?

568
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,575
Are you practicing boxing?

569
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:50,855
What did you stick here?

570
00:36:55,735 --> 00:37:00,568
Ning Meng, don't you think you've gone too far?

571
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,335
You actually find a photo like this.

572
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:12,628
Ning Meng, you hid your feelings very well.

573
00:37:12,628 --> 00:37:15,445
You clapped and cheered for me at the awards ceremony.

574
00:37:15,445 --> 00:37:18,205
At night, you ravage my photos.

575
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:22,155
I did go too far this time.

576
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,815
But I need to vent my anger.

577
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:27,995
Being your secretary is very stressful.

578
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,215
Luckily, I came to your house.

579
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:33,315
This trip was worthwhile.

580
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:35,105
You appeared innocent.

581
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:39,355
But you're vicious. What a hypocrite.

582
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:42,135
Why didn't I notice that you were a hypocrite?

583
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:46,865
What's wrong? Did you drink until you got gastritis?

584
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,065
If you have gastritis,

585
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:51,635
why are you covering your stomach?

586
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:54,235
Should you cover your upper abdomen?

587
00:37:56,295 --> 00:37:57,885
You're putting an act?

588
00:37:57,885 --> 00:37:59,418
Just go.

589
00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:01,575
Go on. Go on pretending.

590
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:04,106
Just go. Song will call the police if you don't go.

591
00:38:04,106 --> 00:38:05,685
Don't tug at me.

592
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,545
My slipper!

593
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,885
Ning Meng, you're out of line!

594
00:38:10,885 --> 00:38:12,575
How could you let me step on the floor barefoot?

595
00:38:12,575 --> 00:38:14,225
Give me my shoes.

596
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:31,295
Mr. Lu, I... I'll get some petrol.

597
00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,495
<i>Hello.</i>

598
00:38:36,495 --> 00:38:38,365
Zeng Yuhang, you fool!

599
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:41,685
You Qi, I'm going to die from anger because of Lu Jiming.

600
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:43,465
It's in the middle of the night. What's the fuss?

601
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:44,815
It's scary, like the "Ring."

602
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:46,575
What kind of terrible idea did you give me, huh?

603
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,015
She doesn't even want the bag.

604
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,605
She even lost her temper at me.

605
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:52,925
Did he think he could buy me off with a bag and be his secretary?

606
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:54,815
He can forget about it.

607
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,905
<i>Mengmeng, don't be so angry.</i>

608
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:58,255
How can I not be upset?

609
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,495
She insisted on transferring to a different department.

610
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,205
Why are you venting your anger at me, then?

611
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:04,665
You can take on projects that cost hundreds of millions. But you can't handle your secretary?

612
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,805
I'm not done talking. You didn't even see how insolent she was.

613
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:12,135
Is he the only one who has feelings while others have no dignity?

614
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:13,975
<i>Calm down for now.</i>

615
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:16,535
<i>Letting him transfer you to the Project Department is your goal, right?</i>

616
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:18,735
Can you get my points or not?

617
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:20,635
I even stepped on the floor with my bare feet.

618
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,505
I'm working out of town now. I'll talk to you when I get back, okay?

619
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:24,405
Bye-bye.

620
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,205
Wait! Zeng Yuhang!

621
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:30,785
I've already decided. No matter what, I'll be part of the Project Department.

622
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,055
Also, one day...

623
00:39:33,055 --> 00:39:34,728
<i>What?</i>

624
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,255
I'm going to make him address me as "director."

625
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,450
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

626
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,170
♫ <i>That could predict when we meet?</i> ♫

627
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,070
♫ <i>Perhaps it's going to be a sight</i> ♫

628
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,450
♫ <i>If we could walk ahead of time</i> ♫

629
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,960
♫ <i>We refused to be defined, be discriminated</i> ♫

630
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,200
♫ <i>And be labeled</i> ♫

631
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,580
♫ <i>To be the best of me</i> ♫

632
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:19,170
♫ <i>To meet the best of you again</i> ♫

633
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:28,040
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

634
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,970
♫ <i>No matter how reluctant you feel</i> ♫

635
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,220
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫
