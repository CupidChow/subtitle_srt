<i>[Episode 29]</i>

3
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,620
Mengmeng, the way you're helping him, seems like you like him.

4
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,560
Right. Do you like him?

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,450
Please stop making those conjectures.

6
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,910
You... I... I like you.

7
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,950
And I like you.

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,150
Such a smooth talker.

9
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,350
Okay, got it.

10
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,180
Leave the pep talk to me.

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,110
And me too.

12
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,460
We'll encourage him and cheer him up together.

13
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, that's right.

14
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,840
Let's do that.

15
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,000
Mr. Ning.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Didn't sleep well last night?

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,080
No, I slept pretty well.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,930
It's hard not to sleep well.

19
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,930
This place has good views and clean air.

20
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,820
And there's no fog.

21
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,770
It really energizes the mind.

22
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,520
Sit, Mr. Ning.

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,110
Why sit down when I just got up?

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,980
Come on. Follow me to buy groceries.

25
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,690
- Old Ning.
- Ms. Li.

26
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,310
Did your future son-in-law come to visit?

27
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,240
He is the nephew of my distant aunt's cousin's nephew.

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,660
Your nephew?

29
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,120
Isn't he a little old?

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
Right. See you around.

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,520
We're back.

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,750
Why did you go and buy groceries so early?

33
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,290
The vegetables are fresh in the morning. Here.

34
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,390
- Soak the ribs.
- Here, give it to me.

35
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,250
Get rid of the blood.

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,000
You guys go wash your hands and get ready to eat.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,420
Okay.

38
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,160
Quickly sit and eat. It will get cold.

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,580
Listen. Lu helped me bargain.

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,320
He saved me 3.20 yuan.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,020
We'll have an extra cold dish tonight.

42
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,060
Thanks to Lu.

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,970
Mr. Lu knows how to bargain now?

44
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,320
Lu, there are fried dumplings I made especially for you.

45
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,160
When you finish eating,

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,650
we'll go and clean up the house together.

47
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,630
Okay.

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,470
Lu, do you know how to gut a fish?

49
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,150
Come help me gut one.

50
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,770
- I...
- Come on. Quickly.

51
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,290
Come on.

52
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,100
Lu, don't just sit around. Go and buy some osmanthus wine.

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,320
It's a necessity for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

54
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,610
Okay.

55
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,140
- Do you have money?
- Yes, I do.

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,500
Lu, what are you doing? Don't sit all the time.

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,570
When a person sits for too long, they'll become lazy.

58
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,360
Look. Look. Go on.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,050
Water the plants out there.

60
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,260
Make sure they're quenched.

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,950
There, those over there.

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,250
Yes.

63
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,490
It's you.

64
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,160
I thought it was your dad again.

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,340
Is your dad asleep?

66
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,100
Yes.

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,370
Have some tea. Wake yourself up.

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,750
How is it? You were running off your feet the whole day.

69
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,180
Pretty fulfilling.

70
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
Fulfilling?

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,450
Why do I feel that you just got free labor for your family?

72
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,290
You dare laugh?

73
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,510
Gloating now, are you?

74
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,140
Got your sharp tongue back, Mr. Lu?

75
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:44,660
Is it because your dad knew how I treated you before?

76
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,520
So he's getting back at me.

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,700
No way.

78
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,390
It could be.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
I can't figure my dad out.

80
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,410
Mr. Ning, you're still up?

81
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,450
I suddenly remembered something.

82
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,570
Accompany me out tomorrow.

83
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,400
An old friend of mine got me ham from a wild pig.

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,120
It will be perfect for making meat-filled mooncakes.

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,210
In the meantime, you can help me practice driving.

86
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,640
I just got my driver's license.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,740
My wife doesn't want me to drive alone.

88
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,580
Okay. Okay.

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,640
I'll go in and sleep now.

90
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,610
Okay, go on.

91
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,680
Keep yourself warm.

92
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,190
Dad, are you sure you're not pushing him too much?

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,020
When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man,

94
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,200
it first frustrates his spirit and will and exhausts his muscles and bones.

95
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,650
Besides, this is for bullying my daughter before.

96
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,750
He deserves it.

97
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,150
Mengmeng, why do I still feel like you like him?

98
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,790
I still like you.

99
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,850
Go and sleep.

100
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,240
Between Ning Meng and me, who is the better driver?

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,550
Both are good.

103
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Relax, relax.

104
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,990
We're just having a chat, yes?

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,460
Relax.

106
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,480
It's another hour to get home.

107
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,200
Ning Meng told us about what happened.

108
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,300
She told you?

109
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,580
Sorry, Mr. Ning.

110
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,260
What? Why are you sorry?

111
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,630
Who are you sorry to?

112
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,380
I used to scold her a lot.

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,310
We butted heads. I always ordered her around.

114
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,330
What?

115
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,160
Mr. Ning...

116
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,520
- I was wrong. I won't do it again.
- Wait.

117
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,570
Hold on. You... You scolded her?

118
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,040
You two butted heads? And you ordered her around?

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
- Listen up, you...
- Mr. Ning!

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,070
If not for driving rules, I'd throw you out of the car.

121
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,960
Seriously!

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,700
Wait. Were you...

123
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,090
Weren't you asking about that?

124
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,510
Ning Meng told me about what had happened to you in the past months.

125
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,020
Listen. You... Peel me a mandarin orange.

126
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,120
I love mandarin oranges.

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,800
When Ning Meng was born, I was going to name her Ning Xiaoju.
<i>("Ju" means "mandarin oranges")</i>

128
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,010
But her mom didn't like the name.

129
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,750
So we decided on Ning Meng.

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,470
Tastes pretty good.

131
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,440
To be frank, life is like driving a car.

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,350
Once you start driving, it sometimes goes fast, sometimes slow. It stops and goes.

133
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,320
When you need to brake? When you need to speed up?

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,610
All of these depend on the situation, right?

135
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,960
Your current situation is like going too fast while driving downhill.

136
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,430
You couldn't brake in time and crashed into a mound.

137
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,440
Then the car is broken.

138
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,870
- Ning Meng must have told you about my failed entrepreneurship.
- Yes, she did.

139
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,050
At the time, I was of a similar age as you, in my 40s.

140
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,470
Wait, Mr. Ning.

141
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm not over 40 years old.

142
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,100
I'm in my early 30s.

143
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,880
You sure look older.

144
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,300
Honestly, what I went through was way worse.

145
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,670
But I got through it, didn't I?

146
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,770
Think positive.

147
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,020
When you think through it, you'll understand.

148
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,500
Eating imported fruits that cost 500 yuan makes me happy, yes?

149
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,970
Eating mandarin oranges that cost 5 yuan also makes me happy.

150
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,010
The most important thing is...

151
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,540
to have someone beside you to support you.

152
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,380
To be with you through thick and thin.

153
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,710
I'm telling you! That is a blessing money can't buy.

154
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,350
Right?

155
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,200
That makes sense.

156
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,960
It's akin to filling up the car's tank.

157
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,520
We're able to continue driving.

158
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,230
Don't worry.

159
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,020
People don't suffer bad luck forever.

160
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,650
Sooner or later, good luck will come.

161
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,450
Thanks, Mr. Ning.

162
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,030
Put the filling inside.

163
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,330
Lu.

164
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,900
Do you prefer your mooncake sweet or salty?

165
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,010
My family eats the sweet ones.

166
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,210
Sometimes, a change of taste is good.

167
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,400
The Nings' handmade meat-filled mooncake have only ever gotten rave reviews.

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,100
Indeed.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Whether or not a mooncake is good depends on its filling.

170
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,600
So my ghee crust is not important?

171
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
The crust is even more important.

172
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not a mooncake without a crust.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
That's a lion's head meatball.

174
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,000
Why did you make a dumpling?

175
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
- I'll make a new one.
- No, no.

176
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Let me see.

177
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
This dumpling looks quite festive.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,900
We've never eaten a dumpling-like mooncake.

179
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,000
Pretty novel.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Mr. Lu, you know how to make dumplings?

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Dumpling is good. The shape doesn't matter.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
- So long as it's edible, right?
- Yes.

183
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
You don't need to console me.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
I'll make a new one.

185
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,300
No, it's fine.

186
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,500
When I made the mooncake into a bun before, my dad praised me for being creative.

187
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,000
They're really not consoling you.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
That's right.

189
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Here, put your stamp.

190
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Stamp it wherever you like.

191
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>[Prosperity]</i>

192
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
- Lovely.
- It looks pretty good.

193
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,800
It has color now.

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
The mooncakes are ready.

195
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Here.

196
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Try the mooncake you made yourself.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Try it.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
Okay.

199
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
How is it?

200
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Is the mooncake-flavored dumpling good?

201
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,400
It's good.

202
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,500
Nice.

203
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Come on, let's cheers.

204
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
- Okay.
- Come on.

205
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,100
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

206
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,400
It's our hometown's tradition.

207
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
One lamp for one wish.

208
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,300
I wish for good luck and smooth sailing.

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,300
You should make one, too.

210
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,300
Send all the bad luck into the past.

211
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,980
<i>[Su Weiran]</i>

212
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,700
You brought me back to your hometown.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
Is your boyfriend okay with that?

214
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,700
We already broke up.

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,400
When did that happen?

216
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,000
It's in the past. Let's not talk about it.

217
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
So how have you been the past few days?

218
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Did my dad's energizing potion work?

219
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,900
I know you and your family did all this for me.

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,400
Thank you.

221
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,400
I think your family is full of warmth.

222
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,300
It's very down-to-earth.

223
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,400
It's something I'd yearned for

224
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
but have never experienced.

225
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,000
During these past few days, spending time with your mom and dad

226
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,500
made me understand why you have such a great personality.

227
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
If you like it, you're welcome to visit often.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,500
Welcome.

229
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,700
By the way, my dad enjoys playing Mahjong.

230
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,500
He's the kind of player who is very bad at it but would play every chance he gets.

231
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,200
But our family doesn't have enough members.

232
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
You can make up the fourth.

233
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Okay.

234
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
Later when I go back, I'll play with him.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,300
I'll let him win the game. Okay?

236
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,800
Okay.

237
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
After so long,

238
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,500
it's the first time seeing you smile happily.

239
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
I think what your dad said is right.

240
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,300
A person won't suffer from bad luck forever.

241
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,800
The tide will surely turn.

242
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
That's right.

243
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,400
So you... need to cheer up.

244
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
If you continue to brood

245
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,800
and let those who hurt you go unpunished,

246
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
that'll be too easy for them.

247
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,900
I get it.

248
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,800
He Yueluan didn't choose to work with Shuangxun

249
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,400
due to the last-minute change.

250
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
They'd long been after my dad's company.

251
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,300
Not just your dad's company.

252
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,100
But you as well.

253
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,300
You mean...

254
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
The liquidation of my private placement stock

255
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,900
wasn't a coincidence?

256
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
While purchasing stocks,

257
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Shuangxun made use of Caihuang Capital to manipulate stock prices.

258
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
It was to prevent any problems with their asset management.

259
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,600
So my guess is...

260
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,300
that they also did something to your private placement stock.

261
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,400
I didn't tell you before

262
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
because I thought you couldn't handle another problem.

263
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,600
But I think it's time to let you know.

264
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
It's still just an assumption though.

265
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
I don't have any proof.

266
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Lu Jiming, you need to get back on your feet.

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,400
Rebuild your empire.

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,000
Only by regaining power can you stop them.

269
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,800
All right, you don't have to see us off.

270
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,100
I never expected the kid to be so handsome.

271
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,200
Very handsome.

272
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Incredibly handsome.

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,500
Last night, Lu asked me to teach him how to iron.

274
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Look. He ironed everything himself. Looking dapper now.

275
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,000
Son, listen up.

276
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Next time there's a festivity,

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
come visit if you want.

278
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,200
Lu, next time you come, I'll try to cook northeastern food for you. Okay?

279
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay.

280
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Enough nagging already. We have to catch the train.

281
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
Okay.

282
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,800
Mengmeng, divide this among you two later. You know what to do.

283
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Yes, the Victory Cake.

284
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Every time I had an exam or had to go on a trip, they'd prepare this for me.

285
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
Eat it and you'll be victorious, they said.

286
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,000
Lu, don't stress yourself too much.

287
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,800
In life, one failure doesn't mean it's the end.

288
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
As a parent,

289
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,800
what we hope for is for our child to be happy and content.

290
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
Whether you succeed or not

291
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
is what others think of you.

292
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,700
Whether or not you're happy

293
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,800
is decided by your own self.

294
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
All right, stop nagging. They have to get going.

295
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,500
Okay, there. Take it.

296
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,000
Hand it over. Here.

297
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Look out for each other, you two. Safe trip back.

299
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,600
Okay, don't worry.

300
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
We're off, Sir and Madam.

301
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Let's go. We're going to be late.

302
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,000
Lu, please take care of Mengmeng.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
I will.

304
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,800
Mengmeng, you take care of Lu.

305
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
I will.

306
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,100
Mengmeng, you're back.

307
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,800
My father got you these. Your favorite peach crisp and stinky tofu.

308
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,200
Your dad is awesome.

309
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Do I look good?

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,200
What's this?

311
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,700
I'm starting work tomorrow.

312
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,800
You found a job?

313
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
Change into slippers. We'll talk inside.

314
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,400
Quick, tell me all about it.

315
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
It's actually a beauty consultant at a cosmetics counter.

316
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,200
Just a sales assistant.

317
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
It's not anything grand like investment personnel.

318
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,200
You won't look down on me, right?

319
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't be silly.

320
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
No profession is better than another.

321
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
The job really suits you.

322
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,100
You're good-looking and know makeup.

323
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,400
Has great taste, too.

324
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,000
But this is my first ever job.

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Honestly, I'm a little unsure.

326
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Do you remember when we were in university,

327
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,400
I was self-conscious because I didn't know how to do makeup?

328
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
The guys would make fun of me.

329
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,900
But you stood up for me and scolded them.

330
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
You even gave me your makeup

331
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,600
and taught me step by step.

332
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
You told me that putting on makeup isn't to impress others.

333
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,000
It's to please yourself.

334
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,800
When you stand in front of the mirror and see a beautiful self,

335
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
you'll feel more confident too.

336
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,800
At the time, I thought you were so much braver than me.

337
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,800
So I'm sure you'll be okay.

338
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
You really think so?

339
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,700
Of course. You're amazing.

340
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,200
Believe in yourself.

341
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,100
Besides, with your looks and elegance,

342
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,300
you're perfect to be working with cosmetics.

343
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,400
Let's make a deal then.

344
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
In the future, you can only buy cosmetics from me. I'll give you a staff discount.

345
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,400
For sure.

346
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,100
I'll go to you even if there's no discount.

347
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,900
From now on, you and I will both welcome a wonderful new life.

348
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,400
Okay.

349
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
Good morning.

350
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Morning, Ning Meng.

351
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Good morning.

352
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,700
Your seat has been taken by the new intern.

353
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,800
Then, where do I sit?

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
- Ms. Shi.
- Ning Meng.

355
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Ning Meng, from today onward,

356
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,400
you will be Eaglestone Capital's investment director.

357
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,100
Director?

358
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
Did you say "director"?

359
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes, Investment Director.

360
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,500
Congrats.

361
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
Congrats, Director Ning!

362
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,400
This is so sudden. I...

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,300
Lin Dayi's company is now on the NEEQ.

364
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,700
They've become a hotly contested company for public listed companies.

365
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,300
You previously made a beautiful comeback with the Lehui project, too.

366
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,200
These are two big accomplishments.

367
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,800
So you are well deserving of this accolade.

368
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

369
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,300
Thanks, everyone.

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,600
Do you like it?

371
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Take your seat.

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Director Ning, that one is your seat.

373
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,300
Look how happy you are.

374
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,800
This happened too fast.

375
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
It's like a dream.

376
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Seniority doesn't apply in the investment world.

377
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
This industry is all about capability.

378
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,800
My capability is only part of the reason.

379
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,300
The other half is because I got lucky.

380
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,700
Actually, I believe in this saying.

381
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,600
The more hardworking a person is, the luckier they are.

382
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
You're exactly that sort of person.

383
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
<i>[Ning Meng]</i>

384
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,400
There's something I've been wanting to talk to you about.

385
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,000
Do you remember back when you were handling Lehui,

386
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,300
I said I had some money I was saving for something else?

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's like this.

388
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,700
I've been wanting to open up a branch in Singapore.

389
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,300
The preparations are about done.

390
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,000
In addition, my boyfriend is working there, too.

391
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,200
So I'm planning to leave next year.

392
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,000
So you're leaving Shanghai?

393
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,600
I wish to be in a new environment.

394
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,400
A new start.

395
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,900
I might not be able to handle all the business affairs here.

396
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,000
But I feel more reassured with you here.

397
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Ning Meng, I believe that very soon,

398
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,200
you'll be able to stand on your own.

399
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
All the best.

400
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,000
Okay, I won't take up your time.

401
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Enjoy the new space.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,500
- Thanks, Ms. Shi.
- No need to see me out.

This is specially made for Mengmeng. Qiqi's celebratory egg tarts.

414
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,300
You can even make egg tarts?

415
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,000
There's a lot I can do.

416
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
You can't be the only one improving.

417
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,200
I am working hard, too.

418
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,800
Here.

419
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,500
Congrats, Mengmeng. You've realized your dream of becoming an investment director.

420
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,100
Thank you.

421
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,800
Mengmeng, I know it's been hard to get to where you are today.

422
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,500
I still remember the look on your face when you clenched your teeth

423
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
and vowed to have your ex-boss call you director.

424
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,400
Without realizing it, you've really become a director.

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
You're right.

426
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,500
Tell me. How does it feel to be Director Ning?

427
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
A little happy.

428
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
But also a little nervous.

429
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
After all, this is just the first step.

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,400
I have a long road ahead of me still.

431
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,600
But I have faith that you'll be even better.

432
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,100
Because Heaven rewards hardworking people.

433
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,800
We will all become better.

434
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,500
All the best.

435
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
Morning, Director Ning.

436
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,800
Morning.

437
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
Good morning, Director Ning.

438
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,100
Morning.

439
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,700
Director Ning.

440
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,600
We need these documents signed.

441
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,400
You can just call me Ning Meng. You're being too formal.

442
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,500
You're a newly-appointed director. You'll get used to it.

<i>[Lu XX]</i>

445
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,200
Hello.

446
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
Mr. Lu.

447
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Did something good happen? You look happy.

448
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,300
Do I?

449
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Thanks.

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
I have good news.

451
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,200
I've decided. I'm going to make a comeback.

452
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,800
I gave it a lot of thought.

453
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,800
After so long, I don't have any other strengths or hobbies.

454
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,400
Investment is the only thing I like.

455
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,200
And what you're best at.

456
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,400
The point is I came to a realization.

457
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I truly enjoy this line of work.

458
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,300
Your dad's words reminded me.

459
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,400
Success and failure are not the only measuring stick.

460
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,000
Doing what you like is what matters.

461
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Recently, I heard a story.

462
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,300
An old man entrusted his hard-earned money to an investment company.

463
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,800
The company invested the money into a pharmaceutical R&D institution.

464
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,600
After some years, they successfully developed a new drug.

465
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,700
And the drug managed to treat the old man's long-term illness.

466
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,200
The story really inspired me.

467
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,800
I think of investment as making friends.

468
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
Building trust between strangers.

469
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,500
Helping each other; giving back.

470
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,600
As they say, pay it forward.

471
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,000
I think this is the meaning of good investment.

472
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,200
It's also what makes me happy.

473
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,400
Then, you'll have to get a new company.

474
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I've already contacted a business registration agency.

475
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,800
I'm able to acquire an existing finance company.

476
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
I've asked for the price.

477
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,700
The investment management company under them has a low transfer fee.

478
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,800
The process is straightforward, too. It has the highest value.

479
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,700
When did you find out?

480
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,400
While you were busy helping my parents over the Mid-Autumn Festival,

481
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
I wasn't doing nothing.

482
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,200
I believed you'd regain your confidence.

483
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
So when I had time,

484
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,100
I helped you think about what happens after.

485
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,400
Guess I'll have to hurry and get the company up and running.

486
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,600
But it's probably going to be small in the beginning.

487
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,200
Ning Meng.

488
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Can you...

489
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,000
Director Ning.

490
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,200
Mr. Lu is here, too.

491
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
We'll head up first. We'll start the project meeting once you're back.

492
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay, I'll be right there.

493
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,220
You're a director now?

494
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,520
Yeah.

495
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,600
Congrats.

496
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
What was it you wanted to say?

497
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Nothing.

498
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,700
You're now a director.

499
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,300
I'll have to hurry up and rebuild my name, too. Right?

500
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
Thanks for this.

501
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,300
Why the long face?

502
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,800
This was what you'd been dreaming of when you left Joint Capital, right?

503
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Ning Meng, congrats on your dream coming true.

504

All the best in your career.

A local business trip?

Hello.

601
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,560
I just saw Mr. Jia of Zhongxing with Jin Haiyang.

602
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,510
Wasn't Zhongxing's project handed over to Boyu Capital?

603
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,730
<i>If you hadn't mentioned it, I'd rather not bring up this issue.</i>

604
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,110
<i>You found a person to take over for Mr. Jia out of goodwill.</i>

<i>Who knows if water got into his head?</i>

<i>Jin Haiyang probably sweet-talked him.</i>

607
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,200
Got it. Okay, talk to you again.

608
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,670
Mr. An.

609
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,460
This way.

610
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,130
You helped me before.

611
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,150
By right, I should lend you a hand this time.

612
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,160
But I have my own considerations.

613
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,800
You should know that the company doesn't belong to me alone.

614
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,400
I understand, Mr. An.

615
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,230
Honestly, I still trust in my impression of you.

616
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,780
What about this?

617
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,130
Try and get one or two projects running.

618
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,930
After that, I'll convince my partners

619
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,820
to willingly let you handle the projects.

620
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,390
I might not be able to offer you a lifeline,

621
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,560
but getting icing on the cake is not too bad.

622
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,360
All right. Thanks for your trust.

623
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,850
Where are you? We're in Room 888 on the third floor.

624
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,630
Everyone's waiting for you. Okay, see you.

625
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:43,200
Mr. Jia, long time no see.

626
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,500
What a coincidence, Lu Jiming.

627
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,410
You were nowhere to be found at the company, but I bumped into you here.

628
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,670
Joint Capital withdrawing from the project had inconvenienced you.

629
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,490
My apologies.

630
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:00,350
Mr. Lu, it's too late to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival when it's mid-autumn.

631
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,170
Mr. Jia, Boyu Capital is not a bad company.

632
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,800
They're very meticulous in post-investment management.

633
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,420
I handed your project over to them. You can rest assured.

634
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,770
Don't try and shift the responsibility to others. I don't trust you.

635
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,300
Mr. Jia, I don't mean anything else.

636
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,060
I'm just reminding you.

637
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,220
Jin Haiyang's Caihuang Capital has precedents

638
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,160
of inflating valuation to deceive others.

639
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,470
Deceive? Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black?

640
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,840
Whatever it is, it's better than you ditching us halfway.

641
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,950
What right do you have to criticize?

642
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:41,400
Mr. Jia, I'm just hoping you'll be more careful in choosing who you partner with.

643
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,260
Isn't that Mr. Lu?

644
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,770
What a coincidence.

645
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,750
Are you here for free drinks again?

646
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,770
No, no. I'm sure Mr. Lu is here to spend.

647
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:56,420
Jia, you've got to be the bigger man.

648
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,860
Lu here cared too much for his own.

649
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,370
That made him neglect the bigger family.

650
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,180
Don't be mad.

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,070
Is the person you're meeting not here yet?

652
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,270
Speak of the devil. Let me introduce you.

653
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

654
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,940
Mr. Qin of Nanlin Co. This is Mr. Jin.

655
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,710
No, no. Mr. Jin. Just call me Jin.

656
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,790
Please step inside. This way.
