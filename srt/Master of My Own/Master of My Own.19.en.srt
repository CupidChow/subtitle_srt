Yunniao Tech.

66
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,540
It's been five years since they invented their first product,

67
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,660
the Mobi rowing machine.

68
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,110
During the past five years,

69
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,290
through constant upgrades and improvements,

70
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,970
they not only had breakthroughs in their hardware,

71
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,880
but they've also created software.

72
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,710
<i>[Mobi Product Line]</i>
It provides quality applications

73
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,920
and allows users to customize their own training plans.

74
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,100
Now, we'll go over Mobi's aesthetics.

75
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,600
Let's take a closer look at this treadmill.

76
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,720
Its ability to fold 90 degrees upright means it takes up minimal space.

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,690
Also, check out the rear panel's design.

78
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,620
If you place it in your house,

79
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,310
it works as a nice decoration piece.

80
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,020
The biggest advantage to Mobi fitness equipment is its competitive edge.

81
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,010
I'm talking about social attributes.

82
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,110
This idea came from Mobi's creator,

83
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,040
Mr. Lin Dayi.

84
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,820
Only projects with added value make money.

85
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,640
So when we invest, it's not only in the product,

86
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,450
but also its concept.

87
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,010
Ning Meng. Your brief but concise presentation was very easy to digest.

88
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,950
I have no objections.

89
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,280
Ning Meng, I'm in for sure.

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,880
How are you guys picking investors?

91
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,500

So today is not only about the attendees perusing the project.

94
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,820
It is also for the investee to pick their investors.

95
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,890
For instance, those with advertising and e-commerce resources

96
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,750
will be given more priority for resource integration.

97
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,570
I have e-commerce resources.

98
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,340
We have advertising resources.

99
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,530
I have influencers to promote the product.

100
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,760
Mr. Zeng and I have plenty of KOL resources.

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,390
Wait, wait. Don't fight with me.

102
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,640
If we're talking about resources,

103
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,040
I have the most comprehensive ones.

104
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,540

Mr. Zeng, allow me to put that on the tab first.

148

Now that the memory is still fresh in my mind,

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,200
Sorry, Senior, for inviting you at such short notice.

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,570
No need to apologize.

168
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,350
Wasn't today's project the one you told me about at the cafe?

169
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,540
Your friend's project?

170
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,110
So the "friend" was you yourself.

171
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,700
I've made a fool of myself.

172
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,390
We were in the same faculty. No need to shy away.

173
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,790
I didn't want your judgment to be clouded by sentiments.

174
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,800
I prefer to get an objective view from you.

175
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,160
Honestly, I didn't have high hopes for this project initially.

176
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,030
But today, after learning about the upgrades, I changed my mind.

177
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,380
The project has a lot of potential.

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,880
This is totally unrelated to our personal relationship.

179
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,650
It comes solely from a professional investor's point of view.

180
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,000
To perform so well at your first promotional event deserves praise.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,560
Thanks, Senior.

182
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,100
Compared to you, I'm still lacking.

183
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,520
Now Mobi has become a hot product.

184
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,540
Do you think I still have a chance?

185
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,330
You wish to invest?

186
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,630
Sure.

187
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,660
But you'll need to compete fairly with the rest.

188
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,760
Hope you understand.

189
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,590
Of course.

190
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,550
Watching your presentation on stage today

191
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,760
reminded me of the time I first got into investment.

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,430
I was also full of passion then.

193
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,650
I did not simply give up on the projects I had faith in.

194
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,620
But now, I rarely invest so much feeling in any one project.

Ning Meng.

196
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,000
Actually, I came today,

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,050
not because of the project

198
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,050
or to meet Ms. Shi.

199
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,910
I just wanted to see you.

200
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,810
When I see you,

201
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:28,200
I won't forget who I really am.

202
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,650
The original intention I had when I first left the campus...

203
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,310
can only be found in you now.

<i>[Eaglestone Capital]</i>

205
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,130
Ning Meng, congratulations.

206
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,910
- Congratulate me for what?
- It's a secret.

207
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,190
- Ning Meng.
- Ms. Shi.

208
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,250
Have you decided on Mobi's limited partners?

209
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,360
Yes, I have.

210
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,310
In the end, I chose Mr. Liang, Mr. Zhou, and Mr. Zeng.

211
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,470
The share ratio is 4:3:3.

212
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,550
Okay. Get the contract drafted then.

213
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,380
Manager Ning.

214
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,850
Pardon?

215
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,980
You didn't hear wrong. Manager Ning.

216
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,730
Ning Meng, it's been some time since you joined us.

217
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,600
For every task I gave you, you've completed it wonderfully.

218
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,090
Particularly the Mobi project this time.

219
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,730
You were able to see it through even without funding from the company.

220
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,030
You deserve the managerial position.

221
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,480
This time, the name cards are the real deal.

222
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,520
Congrats, Ning Meng.

223
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,590
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

224

Congrats, Ning Meng.

225
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,910
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,210
I only got to where I am today because you trusted in me.

227
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,960
I mean it.

228
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,440
The road ahead is still long.

229
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,350
Keep at it.

230
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,550
We got you cakes. Come.

231
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,320
Check it out.

232
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,370
Everyone, come and eat some cake.

233
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,750
- Come over.
- Hurry over. Let's have some cake.

234
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,260
And you guys, do your best too.

235
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,240
- Yes, ma'am.
- Keep it up!

236
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,790
- We will.
- All the best!

237
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,180
- Thanks.
- It's a happy occasion. Forget dieting.

238
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,740
I have a teleconference. You guys enjoy it.

239
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,540
Go ahead.

240
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,670
Ms. Ning Meng, you've been promoted.

241
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't forget to treat us to a meal.

242
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,620
Will do.

243
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,950
Xiaoya, thank you.

244
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,800
You helped me a lot when I joined the company.

245
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
Oh, save the niceties.

246
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,170
I'll need to think about it properly.

247
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,440
Should we have Japanese or hotpot?

248
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,990
Let's have both. My treat. We can even have two meals.

249
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,300
Great. It's set then.

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,990
Ning Meng?

251
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,410
Xiaoyang, you guys have cakes?

252
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,350
Why are you here? Here, have some cake.

253
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,100
I came to deliver a document to Ms. Shi.

254
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,520
Did something good happen?

255
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,060
"Investment Manager"?

256
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,180
Ning Meng, you got promoted!

257
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm going to take this back and show Mr. Liu.

258
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,890
Investment manager.

259
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,940
Mr. Liu. Look!

260
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,950
Ning Meng got promoted. "Investment Manager."

261
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,320
In such a short time?

262
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,900
I called it. Ning Meng is amazing, isn't she?

263
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,230
Ning Meng really is talented.

264
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,100
- See? I knew Ning Meng was good.
- Yang Xiaoyang. Get me a cup of coffee.

265
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,470
Okay, be right up.

266
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,640
You go ahead.

267
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,950
I knew it. I have a good eye after all.

268
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,130
Your coffee, Mr. Lu.

269
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,160
What were you guys hurrahing about outside? What's up with Ning Meng?

270
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,910
Ning Meng has risen.

271
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,040
No, I mean, she got promoted.

272
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Investment manager.

273
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,000
So she's a manager.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,320
What's the big deal?

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,940
Well, Mr. Lu, here's the thing.

276
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,280
She started out as a secretary like me.

277
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,240
Do you think I'd have the chance to be promoted, too?

278
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,380
I won't jump ship.

279
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,380
I'll stay at Joint Capital and serve you.

280
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,240
You think too much.

283

We're here to celebrate Ning Meng's accomplishment.

Give me a break.

290
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,710
Okay.

291
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,490
He is doing fine. He's the general manager.

292
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,920
It depends on who you compare him to.

293
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,030
If compared to Senior Su, he's still a far way off.

294
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,510
The way he works, I need to put some pressure on him from time to time.

295
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,430
That's how he improves, right?

296
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,750
Yes, right. Qiqi is always right.

297
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh, you. You've been spoiled.

298

Mengmeng, when will Senior get here?

299
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,000
He has a meeting today. So he's a little busy.

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
He'll come right after he's done.

301
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
It's okay. We're not in a rush.

302
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,100
Even so, he's making time to come celebrate with you.

303
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:11,000
Listen. When he gets here, please don't run your mouth, Miss.

304
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,120
I know.

305

Sorry, I'm late.

00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,140
Were you the person I contacted?

330
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,500
Are you Mr. Su of BDI?

331
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,460
What a coincidence.

332
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,660
Do you remember the investor, Mr. Su, I talked about?

333
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,830
Turns out it's our senior.

334
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,290
I had to postpone it due to some reasons. Sorry about that.

335
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,930
No worries. We can meet up another time and have a talk.

336
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,000
Sure.

337
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,210
- Seems like our school really produces a lot of talents.
-That's true.
-That's true.

338
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,830
Come. Let's talk while we eat.

339
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,140
Okay. Let's eat.

340
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,980
Thanks.

341
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,270
It's been years since we graduated,

342
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,110
I do sometimes wish to go back for a look.

343
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,080
Let's go together someday.

344
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,630
- Sounds good.
- Sure.

345
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,720
I also miss my university days.

346
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,740
Life was so much simpler then.

347
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,300
Unlike now, things have become complicated.

348
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,930
Before, we just ate and played, studied, and liked those

349
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,770
for what they were.

350
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,410
Like doing the things we enjoyed?

351
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,190
That's right. What you liked to do was drag me

352
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,020
to go watch our senior play basketball.

353
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,940
That's because he played well.

354
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,180
You were really good, Senior.

355
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,690
I remember now.

356
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,110
At the time, you two would often watch basketball matches together. Right?

357
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,380
Ning Meng was always quiet, but you would be cheering loudly beside her.

358
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,150
- That was you, right?
- Was it youf?

359
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,460
Yes. Back then, you were really cheerful and sweet.

360
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,970
Am I not sweet now?

361
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,940
You're even sweeter now.

362
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,350
You started dating back then?

363
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,200
We've been together a long time.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,980
That's pretty amazing.

365
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,910
Senior. I've got vivid memories of you.

366
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,910
Back then, your name was constantly ringing in my ears.

367
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,210
- My name?
- That's right.

368
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,310
Was it in Year 1 or Year 2 of your postgraduate studies?

369
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,800
I think it was Year 2.

370
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,610
In order to pick a present for you, Mengmeng really went all out.

371
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,110
Do you remember?

372
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,150
It's so long ago. Why would Senior remember?

373
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,060
Even I don't remember it.

374
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,740
I think it was a CD.

375
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,410
Great memory you have there.

376
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,170
You should totally take part in "The Brain".

377
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,660
Don't tell me you remember the songs on the CD, too.

378
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,000
Talking about birthday presents, one of my work partners,

379
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,330
the boss of Mobi, Mr. Lin. His birthday is coming soon. We're pretty close.

380
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,270
- Since he's into fitness, I'm planning to get...
- Mengmeng!

381
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,920
We're reminiscing about our youthful memories.

382
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,710
Can you not talk about work?

383
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,880
Eat, this is good.

384
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,330
- Mr. Su.
- Dig in.

385
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,520
Let's have a good chat later.

386
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,800
Sorry about the last time.

387
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,490
Don't worry about it.

388
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,030
Mengmeng, your eye makeup is smudged.

389
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,010
Go and fix it in the toilet.

390
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,400
Okay.

391
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
You guys eat. I'm going to the restroom.

392
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,410
Okay.

393
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,130
Senior, did you listen to that CD?

394
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,940
I did.

395
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,380
Both Side A and Side B?

396
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,020
Yes, everything.

397
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,790
Did you open up the lyrics and sing along?

398
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,960
Well, that I did not.

399
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,680
That's too bad.

400
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,730
It's nothing.

401
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,800
If you haven't thrown it away, go back and take a closer look.

402
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,420
Side A, Side B, inside and out.

403
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,740
Look through it properly.

404
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,530
Okay.

405
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,510
- Mr. Su, let's drink.
- Okay.

406
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,430
- Here.
- I'll join in.

407
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,740
Just this bit.

408
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:38,260
<i>[Lu Jiming: I heard you got promoted. Congrats.]</i>

409
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,300
<i>[Ning Meng: Thanks.]</i>

410
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,760
<i>[Lu Jiming: I guess Joint Capital is like the military academy.]</i>

411
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,500
<i>[Ning Meng: ?]</i>

412
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,100
<i>[Lu Jiming: A base for cultivating talents.]</i>

413
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,660
What's on your mind?

414
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,040
Why are you smiling?

415
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,450
Because it's a happy occasion.

416
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,450
Come and eat.

417
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,570
Ning Meng.

418
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,330
This is the info on the e-florist. Take a look when you're free.

419
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,650
Okay, I will.

420
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,230
Mr. Lin.

421
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,620
<i>Hello, Ning Meng.</i>

422
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,940
I have a piece of good news.

423
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,290
The investment funds are in.

424
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,980
- I have a new idea I'd like to discuss with you.
- Okay.

425
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,700
<i>[Lin Dayi]</i>

426
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,930
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

427
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,740
<i>[Smart Fitness]</i>
What I want to do now is to upgrade Mobi's aesthetics.

428
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,550
<i>For instance, the treadmill.</i>

429
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:15,160
<i>When it is folded up, the platform looks a little bland.</i>

430
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,220
So I was thinking, perhaps we could print some suitable artwork on the back of it.

431
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,100
Give it some color, you know?

432
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,970
That's a pretty good idea.

433
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,320
Then when it's placed in the living room, it won't look out of place.

434
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,370
It can also serve as decoration.

435
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,600
What we're lacking is a suitable designer.

436
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,830
Or we could just look for a suitable art piece.

437
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,180
Do you have any contacts?

438
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,960
What about this, Mr. Lin?

439
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,580
Send me the style you're after and the budget for it.

440
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,700
I'll look around.

441
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,510
Okay. I'll let you handle it then.

442
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,070
Okay.

443
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,300
<i>[Art exhibition]</i>

444
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,860
<i>[Han Yimeng]</i>

445
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,740
<i>[Han Yimeng]</i>

446
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,840
- Ning Meng.
- Ms. Xu.

447
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,800
- Ning Meng.
- Mr. Zeng.

448
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,870
Fancy seeing you here.

449
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,640
Enough with the "Mr." and "Ms."

450
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,600
What's this? Did Mingming ask you to come to support Meng, too?

451
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,050
- Come, I'll take you to them.
- Tiantian.

452
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,920
Look over there. Is that your dad's friend, Mr. Kong from the auction company?

453
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,400
You should go and greet him.

454
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,150
I think so. Come, hurry.

455
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,000
You go on. I'll be right there.

456
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,670
Ning Meng, what are you doing here?

457
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,600
Mobi wants to work with avant-garde artists to design the treadmill's back panel.

458
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,910
So I came to see if there's anything suitable.

459
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,980
I see.

460
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,690
I'll keep a lookout for you then.

461
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,070
We are partners after all. Right?

462
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

463
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,820
You go ahead and look around. I'll look for Tiantian.

464
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,900
Go ahead.

465
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,020
Do you like this painting?

466
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,430
Ms. Han.

467
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,170
We meet again.

468
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,980
Is this your work?

469
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,350
I don't really know art but for some reason,

470
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,170
the moment I saw it, I was captivated.

471
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,080
It comes across as peaceful, but there seems to be a hidden strength.

472
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,810
Maybe what I tried to portray resonated with you.

473
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,190
Thank you for liking my work.

474
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,970
I hope you don't mind me asking this.

475
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,360
Go on.

476
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,800
A fitness brand would like to work with an avant-garde artist to do a collaborative design.

477
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,330
I wonder if you'll be interested?

478
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,810
I am an independent artist.

479
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,860
I've never done business collaborations.

480
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,190
I understand.

481
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,610
But if you're willing, you can give it a try.

482
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:36,360
This way, your work could reach a wider audience.

483
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,720
I will think about it.

484
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,850
Thank you.

485
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,220
Not at all.

486
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,290
Yimeng, the interview is ready.

487
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,300
Can you do it now?

488
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,810
Okay.

489
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,210
Mr. Lu.

490
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,160
Take your time. I have to go.

491
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,590
Let's go.

492
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,520
Ms. Han, can you tell us how it was for you when you created this painting?

493
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,140
It was pretty chaotic.

494
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,800
Aside from eating and sleeping, I only painted.

495
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,330
I didn't think of doing anything else.

496
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,350
Was the creation of this artwork related to tumultuous emotions?

497
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,790
Any piece of art would require emotional input.

498
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,410
Then what kind of emotional state were you and your boyfriend in at the time?

499
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,170
How is that question related to the painting?

500
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,860
I hope everyone can critique my work more.

501
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,760
Whether it be praise or critique, I'm willing to accept all.

502
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,520
As for my personal life, I prefer to keep that private. Sorry.

503
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,710
Ms. Han, it's been a long time since you had any new work.

504
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,400
Why is that?

505
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,550
Have you lost inspiration? Or is it because you experienced some ordeals?

506
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,740
Are you done?

507
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,850
Let it go, Mingming.

508
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,580
These days, I've been trying hard to readjust my creative process.

509
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,260
Does that mean you are going through a slump?

510
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,380
Sorry. The interview ends here. Let's go.

511
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,270
Ms. Han, did you create this piece because you broke up?

512
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,860
Sorry. The interview is over. No more questions.

513
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,510
Can you not disrupt our interview?

514
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,350
- Was the painting made after you broke up?
- Can you not interrupt our interview?

515
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,240
Excuse us.

516
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,500
- Did you break up?
- What are you doing?

517
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,860
- Who takes photos like that?
- Miss Han.

518
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Which media are you from?

519
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,670
- Who are you to stop me?
- I said no more photographs! Get that in your head!

520
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,820
What's your problem?

521
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,600
Enough! Stop fighting!

522
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,720
This is an art gallery. Can you not make a scene?

523
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,950
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

524
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,000
Yimeng. Are you okay?

525
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,500
Those reporters. They only asked stupid questions.

526
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,400
Unbelievable.

527
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
Why did you pick a fight with them?

528
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,000
Can't you see they were purposely steering you towards that topic?

529
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,200
I couldn't stand them bullying you.

530
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,200
But fighting won't solve anything.

531
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Mingming, it's been so many years.

532
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,800
How come you haven't changed at all?

533
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,200
I'm tired.

534
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I want some time alone.

535
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,000
<i>[Self]</i>

536
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,500
What happened?

537
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,500
- Help me send Yimeng home first.
- Okay.

538
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,300
You go. Your bag.

539
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,500
I'll take care of the reporters.

540
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,200
Don't worry about it, Mingming.

541
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Thanks.

542
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,800
I have a foul temper, don't I?

543
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,000
No need to answer. Forget I asked.

544
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,100
You did it with good intention.

545
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,000
I know you were trying to protect Miss Han.

546
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,000
Forget it.

547
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,900
No need to comfort me.

548
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,600
Have you looked at her work in detail?

549
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
Her painting really inspired me.

550
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,600
It has a sort of therapeutic energy.

551
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Perhaps this is what she desires deep down.

552
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,100
It's true.

553
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,400
Recently, she's been quite moody.

554
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,000
Give her some space.

555
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,100
Things will get better.

556
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,700
Meng, if Mingming has done anything wrong,

557
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,600
just complain about it to me.

558
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't keep it inside.

559
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,700
It's not about him.

560
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,400
It's probably more of my own problem.

561
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,600
I just need some adjusting.

562
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,800
Meng, you and Mingming grew up together.

563
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,600
Us too.

564
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,700
He's always had a soft spot for you.

565
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,900
It's because he cares too much that he got angry with those reporters.

566
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,200
I know.

567
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I've created a lot of trouble for him.

568
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,400
No, he... He doesn't hold that against you.

569
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,800
You just need to show a little appreciation, is all.

570
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,600
Meng, can I ask you something?

571
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,700
Go ahead.

572
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Do you know that Mingming has always liked you?

573
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,800
What do you mean by "always"?

574
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,000
Did you really think his confession back then was a joke?

575
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,200
You're right.

576
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,000
Mingming hasn't changed at all over the years.

577
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,500
You were abroad for a long time. And he's continued to wait for you.

578
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,800
No matter how many advances were made to him, he remained resolute.

579
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
At first, I even made fun of him for his naivety.

580
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,000
But then, I started to admire him.

581
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,600
In this era, temptations are everywhere.

582
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
There are so many possibilities. It's easy for people to change.

583
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,100
But he didn't.

584
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Meng, after more than a decade,

585
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,000
his feelings for you still haven't changed.

586
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,000
<i>Mingming, why are you here?</i>

587
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,700
<i>The guys are doing a farewell party tonight</i>

588
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,200
<i>before you go abroad, right?</i>

589
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>I came to pick you up.</i>

590
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,000
<i>Let's go.</i>

591
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,300
<i>Your riding skill got worse.</i>

592
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,800
<i>That's because you got heavier.</i>

593
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,600
<i>Don't be rude.</i>

594
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,000
<i>Meng.</i>

595
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,600
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

596
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,400
<i>What is it?</i>

597
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
<i>Well...</i>

598
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,000
<i>I like you.</i>

599
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

600
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,000
<i>I know. I like you, too.</i>

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,800
<i>I'm not talking about that kind of like.</i>

602
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,200
<i>You're still a kid. What do you know about "like"?</i>

603
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,000
<i>Stop treating me like a kid, like I don't know anything.</i>

604
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
<i>You can't simply say you like someone.</i>

605
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,300
<i>When you're older and meet a girl you really like,</i>

606
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
<i>you can tell her then.</i>

607
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>I like whoever I like. I won't change.</i>

608
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,800
<i>I won't change!</i>

609
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Hey, Senior.

610
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,600
<i>Ning Meng, are you at home?</i>

611
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
Yes.

612
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
<i>I'm about to reach your place.</i>

613
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,900
<i>Could you come down?</i>

614
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,700
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

615
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,900
What is it?

616
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,600
<i>I'll talk to you in person.</i>

617
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,400
Okay.

618
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Senior.

619
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,200
What is so urgent?

620
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,700
Why don't we take a walk?

621
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,400
We'll talk as we walk.

622
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,500
Okay.

623
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Ning Meng.

624
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,400
One time, on my birthday, you gave me a CD.

625
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
Do you remember it?

626
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Why did you suddenly bring that up?

627
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,100
I guess you never listened to it.

628
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,800
I did actually.

629
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,000
That year, before the year-end exams,

630
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,200
I listened to it many times.

631
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,200
But I was used to storing songs on CDs in my iPod.

632
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,400
So I only opened it one time.

633
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,400
But a few days ago, I found the CD again.

634
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,900
I saw a note in the case.

635
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,200
Thankfully, You Qi told me that day at the dinner.

636
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known.

637
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,800
That You Qi has always been such a busybody.

638
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,000
Senior, just pretend like you never saw it.

639
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
It's all in the past.

640
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,000
Is it really all in the past?

641
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,800
Do you still have the same feelings from back then?

642
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
Do you remember that day?

643
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes.

644
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,700
You said I was a kid and didn't know anything.

645
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,800
After so many years,

646
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,400
did you really not change at all?

647
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,000
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

648
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,600
♫ <i>That could predict when we meet?</i> ♫

649
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
♫ <i>Perhaps it's going to be a sight</i> ♫

650
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,000
♫ <i>If we could walk ahead of time</i> ♫

651
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,400
♫ <i>We refused to be defined, be discriminated</i> ♫

652
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,800
♫ <i>And be labeled</i> ♫

653
