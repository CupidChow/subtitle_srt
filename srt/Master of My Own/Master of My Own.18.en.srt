3
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,290
Ms. Shi.

4
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,360
Have you been favoring and looking out for me

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,670
because of my connection with Mr. Lu?

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,170
Why don't I put it this way?

7
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,360
It's one of the reasons.

8
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,930
But of course, I hired you

9
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,100
because of your competence and potential.

10
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,060
Ning Meng, the workplace is made up of people and affairs.

11
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,600
A person's working capability is very important.

12
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,740
But it can't separate itself from people.

13
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,300
Especially in the investment field.

14
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,950
A person needs more powerful connections.

15
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,160
This is part of everyone's working capability.

16
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,570
Ning Meng, it's to your advantage

17
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,470
if you can maintain a relationship well.

18
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,770
So I think you don't need to be bothered by it.

19
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,830
You're a competent person.

20
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,390
If you know how to make good use of your connections,

21
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,880
you'll make a greater achievement.

22
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,240
Go back and think about this carefully.

23
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,320
Okay.

24
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,660
<i>Mr. Lu and I have a strategic partnership.</i>

25
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,080
<i>If you join us,</i>

26
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,450
<i>you're bound to get in touch with him.</i>

27
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,470
<i>Just as you've said, you might not escape from his circle of network.</i>

28
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,270
<i>Do you mind that?</i>

29
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,070
<i>It's to your advantage</i>

30
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,160
<i>if you can maintain a relationship well.</i>

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
<i>So I think you don't need to be bothered by it.</i>

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,540
<i>Okay.</i>

33
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,040
<i>Mr. Lu, what are you doing here?</i>

34
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,730
<i>I should be asking you.</i>

35
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,950
<i>Ning Meng, have you been following me?</i>

36
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,060
♫ <i>Your heart is feigning</i> ♫

37
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,770
<i>You're getting bold now.</i>

38
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,570
<i>I guess so. In any case, you're no longer my employer.</i>

39
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,110
<i>Thank you.</i>

40
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,200
<i>After I become a director, I'll return this favor twice as much.</i>

41
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,220
<i>When that time comes, you can come back to me.</i>

42
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,970
<i>I won't force you to become my secretary anymore.</i>

43
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,350
<i>I'll let you focus on doing investment.</i>

44
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,270
<i>All right, that's all.</i>

45
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,450
<i>Can't you make it clear?</i>

46
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,880
<i>Mr. Lu, are you begging me to go back to Joint Capital?</i>

47
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,070
<i>Yes, I am. Happy?</i>

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,460
<i>I knew something was going on between you two.</i>

49

♫ <i>At this moment</i> ♫

50

51

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,180
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

61
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,640
Mengmeng, you're home?

62
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,860
Have you eaten? Come and eat something.

63
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,160
I'm starving.

64
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,550
I'll get a drink first.

65
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,900
I'll have this.

66
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,670
Mengmeng, you know what?

67
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,480
It's hard to find a place to stay in Shanghai.

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,500
Anything good would cost a lot.

69
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,110
Anything cheaper would either be old or too far.

70
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,840
Why do I only see one place that is nice

71
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,760
after searching the Bund all day?

72
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,320
Where did all the people find places to stay?

73
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,510
Oh, it's healthy food.

74
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,350
Mengmeng, you're so sweet.

75
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,230
Mengmeng, what's wrong?

76
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,620
I want to move with you.

77
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,250
Why?

78
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,350
Your boss isn't renting to you anymore?

79
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,040
Did that person bother you again?

80
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,620
It has nothing to do with him.

81
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,220
Why are you moving, then?

82
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,160
You're staying in a good place.

83
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,380
You can never find a place at this location

84
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,320
and with this furnishing anywhere.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,160
But I can't afford to pay the price.

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,240
Wait a minute.

87
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,860
Didn't you say your boss is renting it at a cheap price?

88
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,480
I mean I can't afford to return the extra favor.

89
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,440
So you wanted to change your environment

90
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,950
to draw a line between Lu Jiming?

91
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,950
I don't want everything to be done by relying on him

92
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,850
or if it's done indirectly because of him.

93
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,450
Otherwise, I can't stand tall and say I grew up myself.

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,940
You're dauntless, Mengmeng.

95
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,640
I'll support you.

96
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,130
Of course, breaking away from anything physical

97
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,130
is the first step to drawing the line.

98
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,360
Only then you can break away from him emotionally.

99
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,820
Look.

100
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,830
The first step you take is very important.

101
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,200
You can do it.

102
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,900
For our new life.

103
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,400
Let's cheer.

104
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,900
- Here.
- Cheers.

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,590
Is this the decision you made after careful consideration?

106
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,010
Ning Meng,

107
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,750
can you be honest and tell me your reason?

108
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,570
Ms. Shi, you solved a great dilemma of mine

109
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,490
when you rented your place to me cheaply.

110
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,800
I'm truly grateful to you.

111
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,990
But now, I've gotten used to the new company's environment.

112
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,450
So I have the extra energy to consider my life.

113
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,480
I can't depend on you anymore.

114
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,890
If I keep choosing a simple path,

115
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,810
I'm afraid I might lose

116
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,230
my courage and willpower to walk on a difficult path.

117
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,710
You did say that we still need Mr. Lu's experience and judgment.

118
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,300
Mr. Lu is indeed skilled in some way.

119
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,810
But I have confidence in our company.

120
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,380
I have confidence in myself, too.

121
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,530
I no longer want to be the grass under the huge tree like Mr. Lu.

122
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,550
I hope I can grow into a tall big tree someday.

123
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,990
So, I don't want to give up on Mobi.

124
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,100
I have a deep understanding of their company and products.

125
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,130
I also admire Lin Dayi's concept of product development.

126
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,030
With many companies engaging in price competition in the fitness equipment market,

127
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,320
Mobi is dedicated to its specialization.

128
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,480
So I wasn't investing in this project on the spur of the moment.

129
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,000
This is the first good project I have acknowledged since I joined the company.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,020
So I hope you can give me a chance.

131
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,320
I want to give it a try to find a new LP.

132
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,840
Can I?

133
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,860
Sure.

134
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,960
You'll let me?

135
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,930
Since you think it's a good project,

136
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,560
I'll give you a chance to give it a shot.

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,150
But pay attention to sunk costs and time.

138
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,640
Don't worry, Ms. Shi.

139
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,640
About the apartment,

140
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,590
I think you should do what's comfortable for you.

141
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,790
This is it.

142
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,020
Are you sure?

143
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,100
The furnishings aren't as good your boss's place.

144
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,330
I think it's pretty decent.

145
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,780
At least, I feel secure and at ease.

146
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,850
All right, then.

147
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,300
I've asked around and there's another unit for rent upstairs.

148
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
It's bigger than this place.

149
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,110
So it's good enough for He and me.

150
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,910
Really?

151
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,080
Are you happy that we're staying at the same place?

152
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,110
I'm thrilled!

153
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,600
Mr. Zeng?

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,400
Ning Meng, going on a business trip again?

155
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,230
I'm moving out.

156
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,080
You're moving out?

157
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,340
What happened?

158
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,330
You're not staying here anymore?

159
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,180
Mengmeng, come on! The elevator is going down.

160
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm coming.

161
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,590
I'm sorry, Mr. Zeng. My friend is calling for me. I have to go now.

162
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,130
All right. Bye-bye.

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,380
Forget it. It's better this way.

165
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,050
Neighbor?

166
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,840
I think you only want me to do labor work for you.

167
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
Give me the screw.

168
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,820
See? You've wronged me.

169
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,970
I'm purchasing Mobi's fitness equipment that you mentioned.

170
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,870
I'm using practical means to support you. I'm a good friend, right?

171
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,890
All right. At least, my hard work paid off.

172
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,060
Not bad.

173
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,460
I still have two bedside cabinets. I need you to assemble them for me.

174
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,770
You've been living by yourself for so many years.

175
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,850
Shouldn't you know how to do these?

176
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,070
I usually have He around with me. He wouldn't have the heart to let me do anything.

177
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,790
I think He is spoiling you like a big baby.

178
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,550
The only thing he didn't give you is a pacifier.

179
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,440
When is He coming?

180
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,850
Now that you mention it, I'm pretty upset about it.

181
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,450
I've asked when he's coming many times.

182
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,950
He kept saying he was not sure and telling me to wait.

183
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,380
Do you think he's cheating behind my back?

184
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,590
I must call him now.

185
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,100
Did he just hang up on me? He's rebelling.

186
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,790
I'm going to keep calling.

187
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,140
He Yueluan, where are you? Why is it so dark?

188
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,110
<i>I... I was...</i>

189
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,730
What are you holding in your hand?

190
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,860
Why are you holding a bouquet of roses?

191
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,620
He Yueluan, are you doing something behind my back?

192
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,330
I'll open the door.

193
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,000
This is so upsetting.

194
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,590
He?

195
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,330
Ning Meng?

196
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,330
Qiqi, I came right away after I got off the plane.

197
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

198
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,640
I wanted to surprise you.

199
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,300
I don't want you to give me surprises.

200
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,310
I hate surprises the most.

201
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,100
I won't scare you next time.

202
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,110
That's more like it.

203
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,690
Ning Meng, thank you.

204
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,180
I feel more assured with you watching over her during this time.

205
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,780
It's no big deal. She's my friend.

206
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,230
All is good now you're here.

207
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,720
I'll head back to clean up my place now.

208
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,710
I won't be in your way, then.

209
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,000
You...

210
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,710
I'll get my jacket.

211
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,010
You can leave after dinner.

212
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,250
No, thanks. I'll see you around.

213

- Okay, give it to me.

Who are you to Ning Meng?

224

Ning Meng is a person?

225
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,730
Or else?

226
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,590
Don't you know her?

227
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you a thief?

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,170
Would a thief steal trash?

229
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you nuts? I stay here.

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,410
- Who are you calling nuts?
- You.

231
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,500
My friend, sorry about that. It's a misunderstanding.

232
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
- What misunderstanding?
- Get in.

233

Who are you?

234
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Sorry about that. Something's wrong here.

- Thief!
- Mad man.

236
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,870
Ning Meng moved out?

237
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,760
When did she move?

238
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,380
It's been a week.

239
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,340
Why didn't she tell me?

240
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,770
Why would she tell you when you're not the landlord?

241
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,700
Why did she move? Where to?

242
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,180
She didn't tell me.

243
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,310
Why didn't you ask her, then?

244
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,410
How can I ask her?

245
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,160
That's her privacy.

246
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,970
Moreover, it's not a bad thing that she moved out.

247
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,900
What?

248
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,820
Was it because I didn't invest in her project?

249
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,950
So Shi Ying gave her a hard time because she's upset?

250
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm going to ask her now.

251
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,400
Lu Mingming,

252
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,240
do you know doing this makes you look like a scumbag?

253
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,810
What do you mean by that?

254
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,710
How do I look like a scumbag?

255
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,960
I have an objective reason for turning down that project.

256
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,440
Do you think it's about the project?

257
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,060
Don't you think your concern for Ning Meng has crossed the line?

258
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,080
Have I?

259
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,800
Haven't you?

260
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,390
I'm afraid someone might bully her.

261
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,970
Please answer me this. Who are you to say this?

262
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,640
Her boss.

263
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,520
I mean her ex-boss.

264
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,640
Ah, just forget about it.

265
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,550
By the way, any updates on Yimeng's joint exhibition?

266
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,420
This is the exhibition hall layout and exhibition flow. Take a look.

267
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,440
Meng's works are being airlifted from the United States.

268
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,350
The art gallery will take care of that.

269
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,290
Send me the logistics information to me.

270
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,990
I'll arrange transportation to send the works over.

271
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,450
Okay, I'll get it from them now.

325
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,100
Don't get stuck at a dead end.

326
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,180
If this project doesn't work, there are other projects for you. Am I right?

327
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,300
But I do think Mobi is great.

328
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,110
Besides, Mr. Lin trusts me.

329
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,450
Where did it go wrong?

330
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,560
Do you need to consult an expert?

331
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,190
What about Su Weiran?

332
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,590
I think you guys should meet up more.

333
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,750
You'll get closer that way.

334
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,490
Don't be absurd.

335
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,740
Let's go. I got a tasty drink for you.

336
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,430
Thanks.

337
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,880
Senior.

338
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,470
Sit.

339
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,900
Sorry. I'm late.

340
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
It's okay.

341
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,100
So what do you think about my friend's project?

342
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,920
I'll be frank.

343
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,900
I'm not optimistic about this proposal.

344
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,410
I've read the proposal.

345
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,380
It's well-written. The main points are highlighted professionally.

346
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,180
But I think home fitness isn't the right track.

347
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,020
But the concept of health is getting more and more popular.

348
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,570
The home fitness market will also expand.

349
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,370
But there are already so many fitness equipment manufacturers in China.

350
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,800
If the market only relies on such a slight increase every year,

351
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,040
how can that slight increase be enough for everyone?

352
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,820
But Mobi is still a little different from the rest.

353
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,510
It has its own advantages.

354
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,310
Are you talking about the folding function?

355
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,790
The design is clever.

356
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,180
It might interest the market for a short period.

357
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,940
But consumers are forgetful.

358
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,360
Moreover, it's easy for others to copy this.

359
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,800
I got it now.

360
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,310
Ning Meng, what's wrong?

361
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,950
I'm fine.

362
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:38,210
So do you also think there's no need to follow up with this project anymore, right?

363
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,960
When I wrote my thesis in the United States,

364
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,190
the professor said my topic was too difficult

365
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,240
and asked me to change my topic.

366
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,100
I was troubled at the time.

367
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,600
But my professor has more experience,

368
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,250
so I followed what he suggested.

369
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,850
After that, there was a student in a new batch who did the same thing I wanted to research.

370
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,630
He got to stay and work at the uni because of the thesis,

371
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,980
and you can say he has become an expert in this field now.

372
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,050
I may be a little more experienced than your friend.

373
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,060
But she surely knows more about this project.

374
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,070
There must be something that intrigues her.

375
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,000
She should persevere.

376
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:37,520
Tell her not to take over the burden alone.

377
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,030
She needs to find a solution with the founder.

378
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,580
If they can lay all the cards on the table now,

379
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,530
they never know if they will have some new ideas.

380
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,900
Thank you, Senior.

381
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,660
I'll let her know.

382
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,580
<i>[Xiaochuanke BBQ]</i>
Ning Meng, try this.

383
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,750
The barbecued meat here is authentic.

384
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,780
Try it.

385
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,900
It's delicious.

386
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,590
What's wrong?

387
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,020
Mr. Lin, I'll be honest with you.

388
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,450
I've been looking for many LPs.

389
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,540
But it didn't go well.

390
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,480
The feedback I received from these companies

391
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,330
regarding Mobi Fitness Equipment's

392
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,350
folding functions and specializations

393
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,720
aren't enough to be a highlight.

394
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,160
That's all?

395
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,680
I thought it was something serious.

396
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,670
It's not even the first time. I can take it.

397
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,820
Listen. I've already learned how to cope with this feedback.

398
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,060
How did you learn to cope with it?

399
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,840
It had been many years since I quit my job to start my business.

400
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,110
I've met with too many setbacks.

401
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,330
At first,

402
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,280
I didn't come around,

403
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,400
so I felt embarrassed and my dignity was hurt.

404
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,980
But after failing again and again,

405
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,720
I slowly learned how...

406
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,460
Learned how to cope with rejections?

407
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,540
I learned how to get used to failures.

408
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,040
You're funny.

409
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,210
I'm not kidding.

410
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,200
You can't expect everything to be smooth sailing for life.

411
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,890
Who would say that they've never failed?

412
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,490
Don't you think so?

413
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,320
Yes, you're right.

414
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,600
There were times when things didn't go well with my projects.

415
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,500
See? It happens, right?

416
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,910
So what should you do? Are you going to give up?

417
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,170
No, you can't.

418
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,340
When I ran into some problems I can't solve,

419
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,730
I'd ask several friends to come here to eat.

420
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,250
We'd eat as we drank.

421
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,990
Then there'll be nothing that you can't overcome.

422
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,340
Here. Drink this and we're comrades, too.

423
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,110
You're right.

424
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,600
Sometimes, encouragement from friends can be really useful.

425
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,830
Of course.

426
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,530
I'll be honest with you.

427
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,550
I almost gave up on Mobi's project.

428
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,030
Fortunately, I have my good friend to encourage me.

429
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,310
That's how I persevere.

430
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,800
Right. This is especially similar to a beginner running a marathon.

431
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,100
Do you know how a beginner runs a marathon?

432
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,110
How?

433
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,330
He'll get several of his friends to join him in the run.

434
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,420
That way, when he's about to give up,

435
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,090
there would be someone who steps up to encourage and motivate him.

436
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:01,110
Then, he'll be able to run one extra kilometer that way.

437
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,050
I think... It's my personal opinion.

438
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,410
I think working out is a boring thing to do.

439
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,000
But it's easier to stick to it with company and encouragement around.

440
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,840
You're right.

441
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,670
With that reasoning, why would people

442
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,460
use their treadmill as clothes rack after buying it?

443
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,660
This is the problem.

444
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,550
You're right.

445
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,430
After all, home fitness lacks the environment of a fitness center.

446
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:29,260
What it lacks, even more, is the mutual interaction and motivation between people.

447
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,150
You're right.

448
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,650
This is a big problem.

449
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:39,170
What if we include all Mobi users in a fitness group chat?

450
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,900
Would the environment become...

451
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,800
Do you mean something like a WeChat Moment?

452
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,570
Yes, they can interact with each other, give likes, and leave their comments.

453
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,580
They can even organize contests online, too.

454
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,010
There'll be rewards for winners.

455
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,350
I'll pay for the prize.

456
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,240
That's great.

457
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,200
Your idea is incredible.

458
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,350
And it's all about software updates.

459
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,200
That's what I used to do in my previous job.

460
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,340
That's awesome. Let's drink.

461
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,200
All right. Cheers.

462
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,080
That's great.

463
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,190
Put it here.

464
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,360
We've moved everything here. If there's nothing else, we'll leave.

465
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,430
Okay, thanks.

466
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,950
Come on.

467
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,040
You bought so many.

468
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,390
Yes. I was thinking

469
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,510
you could paint if you had nothing to do at home.

470
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,320
You might feel better, then.

471
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,460
I don't know what brand of paints you usually use.

472
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,920
So I bought everything.

473
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,420
Is this easel big enough for you?

474
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,810
We can change to a bigger one if it's not big enough.

475
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,870
It's okay.

476
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,650
I might not have any inspiration to create anything.

477
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,710
Why don't we go see a talk show

478
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,440
and listen to some jokes? It'll be fun.

479
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,210
Mingming, you don't have to accompany me.

480
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,740
Just get back to your work. I'm feeling a lot better now.

481
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,590
Before you're completely okay, I'll keep accompanying you.

482
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,960
If you want to accompany me to do something,

483
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,130
take me to visit your dad.

484
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,580
Why do you want to visit him?

485
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,330
It's been so long since I've visited him.

486
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,920
So how's everything? Are you two getting along now?

487
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,230
Still the same.

488
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,510
I haven't seen him for years. Take me to him.

489
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,830
All right.

490
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,760
I think he'd be happy to see you, too.

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,400
Hello, Mr. Zhou. I've already sent the new business proposal to your email.

496
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,350
Please remember to check it.

497
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,070
Yes, Madam Liu.

498
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,680
<i>Ning, I saw your post.</i>

499
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,850
<i>Can you help me buy that rowing machine?</i>

500
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,060
Just pull it like this.

501
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,540
Look. This is how it's used.

502
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,980
It's exactly the same as the one you posted online.

503
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,280
The color is too lovely.

504
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,550
Not only does this model have a nice color,

505
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,800
but it also... Watch me.

506
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,520
- It doesn't hurt your joints.
- That's right.

507
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,500
It doesn't stress your heart either. It's suitable for the elderly.

508
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,740
The doctor has told him to do more exercise.

509
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,730
But he refused to go to the fitness center

510
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,530
and meet with other young men.

511
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,000
He's afraid that others might laugh at him.

512
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,740
I'm not afraid of that.

513
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,300
- I just don't have the time.
- You ...

514
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,700
Stop lying. You have time now and the equipment is here.

515
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,650
Can you exercise on this every day?

516
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,670
Enough, just get back to your work.

517
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm pretty busy actually. I have something cooking on the stove.

518
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,960
Mr. Lu, why don't you give it a try?

519
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,020
- Okay, I'll give it try.
- See how it feels.

520
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,300
Is this really like rowing a boat?

521
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,410
Place your legs here.

522
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,990
Here?

523
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,410
Yes. To secure your legs into position.

524
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,000
Over here.

525
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,860
This rowing machine had won the IF award.

526
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,500
It simulates the real feeling of rowing.

527
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,070
Also, if you link it to our latest APP,

528
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,500
the circle of friends can organize a tournament.

529
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,720
I have one at home. If we have time, let's give it a go.

530
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,320
I do enjoy competing with other people.

531
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,780
I must say this is pretty interesting.

532
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,190
Right?

533
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,020
Link both pieces of equipment to compete.

534
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,640
Isn't this similar to playing games?

535
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,050
I'll get the door. I wonder who's here.

536
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,180
Madam Liu.

537
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,050
Hello, I'm Han Yimeng.

538
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,370
- Come on in.
- Please go in.

539
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,990
Welcome.

540
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,290
Mr. Lu.

541
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,710
Meng? When did you come back?

542
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,840
Not so long ago.

543
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,250
Mingming happens to be free today, so we came to visit you.

544
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,320
Here's a gift for you.

545
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,520
I will accept this then.

546
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,560
Of course, you will.

547
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,510
Ning Meng, what brings you here?

548
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,920
Ning is here to send this rowing machine.

549
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,610
You should thank her.

550
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
This is my friend, Han Yimeng.

551
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,430
This is Ning Meng.

552
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,920
She's my...

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,480
I once worked as Mr. Lu's secretary.

554
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,030
Hello, Miss Han.

555
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,530
Nice to meet you.

556
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,810
Come and have a seat.

557
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,270
Pour some water.

558
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,790
- Come and have a seat.
- Sit.

559
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,980
Ning, I almost forgot about you. Come and sit.

560
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,670
You were busy all day. Yet, I forgot about you.

561
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,950
Come and join us for tea.

562
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,170
It's okay. Mr. Lu, I won't be staying.

563
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,650
I have a meeting later. So I'll get going first.

564
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,940
I've already set up this equipment for you anyway.

565
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,620
Remember to give me feedback on the user experience, okay?

566
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,120
I'll get going first. I'll leave first.

567
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,660
- See her off.
- All right.

568
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,570
Madam Liu, let me go.

569
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,030
Okay.

570
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,700
Ning Meng.

571
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,970
Mr. Lu, you don't have to see me out. I know the way.

572
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,180
I want to ask you something.

573
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,800
Did you move out?

574
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,510
Yes.

575
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,400
- Why?
- No reason.

576
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,720
Did Shi Ying make it hard on you and kick you out

577
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,910
because I didn't invest in Mobi?

578
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,890
No, I didn't want to stay there anymore.

579
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,690
You're acting weird today.

580
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,570
Why are you talking indifferently to me?

581
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,960
Are you upset with me because I didn't invest in Mobi?

582
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,160
Mr. Lu, you overthink.

583
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,660
After Mobi made some improvements, the progress is going very well.

584
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,370
You should head back inside. I'll get going now.

585
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,840
See you.

586
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,540
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

587
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,990
Drink more.

588
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,630
Eat something.

589
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,270
I only made some home-cooked meals today.

590
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,040
I don't know if they're to your liking.

591
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,230
After so many years overseas, I miss home-cooked meals the most.

592
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm going to enjoy this. Thank you.

593
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,280
Well, that's easy to arrange.

594
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,040
Next time, you can just come and eat here often.

595
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,060
She may not be good at other things,

596
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,710
but she's good at cooking.

597
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,640
Oh, try the fermented glutinous rice wine.

598
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,650
Ning taught me how to make it.

599
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,220
It's pretty good.

600
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,840
- Ning Meng?
- Yes.

601
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,360
That kid is really thoughtful.

602
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,720
She used to be Mingming's capable assistant.

603
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,520
If it weren't for her,

604
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,090
Mingming wouldn't come home regularly.

605
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,310
With that temper of his,

606
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,960
he won't listen to anybody but Ning.

607
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,530
What are you talking about?

608
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,660
We're talking about Ning Meng.

609
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,790
I didn't expect there would be someone who could control you while I was away for years.

610
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,910
You look pretty skinny.

611
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,270
Eat more today. Make today an exception and don't diet.

612
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,550
Meng, you're not young anymore.

613
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,300
Have you settled down yet?

614
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,240
Are you a matchmaker?

615
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,470
Why would you worry about this?

616
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,700
Is this how you speak to your folks?

617
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,140
Do you think everyone's like you?

618
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,560
You're not young, but you're still single.

619
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,010
Not continuing the family is the biggest sin of all.

620
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm only worried about Meng.

621
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,650
You must stay out of this.

622
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,950
Mr. Lu,

623
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,290
I just broke up not too long ago.

624
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,860
This is how things are right now.

625
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,850
The better the criteria, the harder to find a partner.

626
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,660
Thank you.

627
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,570
Isn't it like that with Mingming?

628
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Meng, I have many outstanding men working at my company.

629
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,880
Don't worry. I'll take care of this for you.

630
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,470
Okay?

631
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,710
Do you even know what kind of guy she likes?

632
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,710
How can you take care of it?

633
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,320
There are all sorts of guys available.

634
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,030
Elites back from overseas, students from elite schools,

635
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,810
handsome, and easy to approach.

636
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,970
But I think Meng likes a guy who's warm-hearted, right?

637
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,580
You know what a warm-hearted guy is?

638
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,120
Are you looking down on me?

639
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,250
It doesn't matter if it's warm or cold,

640
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,500
all are available.

641
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:09,130
The thing is I think Mingming and Meng are a good match.

642
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,940
They grew up together and are compatible with each other.

643
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,270
Impossible.

644
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,450
Mingming and Meng grew up together.

645
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,470
Meng is like his older sister.

646
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,820
That's true. Come on.

647
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,830
Let's have a toast

648
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,140
and welcome you to come back for meals frequently.

649
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,600
- Thank you.
- I'll cook for you.

650
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,840
- Cheers.
- Mr. Lu, cheers.

651
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,220
Mr. Lin, our feedback on our news plan is very positive.

652
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,620
Several companies have already contacted me in such a short time.

653
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,070
They said they are interested.

654
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,510
<i>Really?</i>

655
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,850
That's great.

656
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:06,380
It means our highlight on socialization is right, correct?

657
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,060
Ms. Shi also said we should strike while the iron is hot.

658
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,590
So I've contacted the representatives of these companies

659
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,790
and invited them to our company to have a small meeting on investment recommendations.

660
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,840
We'll choose the most suitable LP among them.

661
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,600
After that, we'll decide how to distribute the quota.

662
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,200
Back then, we were hoping others would pick us.

663
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,430
Now, it's finally our turn to pick them.

664
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,420
Ning Meng, I have to thank you.

665
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,790
Mr. Lin, don't say that.

666
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,660
- We'll keep in touch if there's anything.
<i>- Okay.</i>

667
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,530
All right. I'll see you around.

668
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,320
<i>[Mr. Liang]</i>

669
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,950
Even Mr. Liang from Rongxin Capital is coming?

670
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,880
He said he is interested in this project.

671
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,070
The scale of our recommendation meeting is getting bigger.

672
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,100
From a small meeting to a summit conference.

673
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,350
In that case, I'll join the meeting too.

674
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,760
After that, you can give your all.

675
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I'll mobilize all resources to support you.

676
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,430
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

677
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:11,210
I think you should invite Mr. Lu.

678
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,110
I know he's not interested in this project.

679
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,960
But out of courtesy, I think it's better to invite him.

680
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,400
It's up to him if he comes or not.

681
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,550
All right.

682
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,670
If you know any investors, you can invite them to join too.

683
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,520
I do have a senior who's currently the managing director of BDI.

684
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,390
But he might not be interested in this project.

685
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,590
It doesn't matter.

686
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,170
Just invite him over, so everyone can get to know each other.

687
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,560
All right.

688
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,190
No problem. Don't worry.

689
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,020
I'll be there at 2:00 p.m.

690
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,880
Come in.

691
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,630
- Yes, Mr. Su?
- Reschedule tomorrow's meetings to the day after.

692
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,480
Mr. Su, you have an important meeting tomorrow afternoon.

693
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,890
It's a meeting with Mr. He, the manager of the insurance agency scheduled in advance.

694
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,460
Can you explain to him

695
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,780
that I have something urgent to handle on my side?

696
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,670
Don't let him feel we're giving him the cold shoulder.

697
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,090
All right.

698
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,970
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

699
