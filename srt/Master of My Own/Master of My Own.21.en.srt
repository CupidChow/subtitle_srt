1
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,650
<i>[Master Of My Own]</i>

2
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,500
<i>[Episode 21]</i>

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,230
It should be here somewhere.

4
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,700
Okay.

5
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,190
Let's split up and search.

6
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,550
Okay.

7
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,380
These are albums from high school.

8
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,810
We'll need to find the university ones.

9
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,870
I've got the university ones.

10
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,100
Here, look through these.

11
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,080
- Okay.
- Here.

12
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,360
Yimeng, do you remember how big or thick the album is?

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,200
I took part in an art exhibition. So it wouldn't be too big.

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,470
Something I could easily carry.

15
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,370
Easily carry?

16
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,530
Could it be like a sketchbook?

17
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,490
Probably.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,240
Let's continue searching.

19
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,370
Here.

20
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this the one?

21
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,360
"Star Gallery."

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,620
Is this it?

23
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,240
Yes, that's the one.

24
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm sorry. Miss Han's painting has been sold.

25
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,130
May we know the buyer's contact?

26
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,340
I'm sorry. Our policy is to keep buyers' information confidential.

27
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,830
Not even the artist can know?

28
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,090
It's imperative that I find the buyer.

29
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,630
Well...

30
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,170
All right. I'll try and get in touch with the buyer.

31
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,500
See if they're willing to meet.

32
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,650
Okay. Thank you.

33
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,360
Thanks.

34
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,630
The painting was previously hung here.

35
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,770
But later, a customer who dined here purchased it.

36
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,120
They came to eat and casually bought the painting?

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,490
The guest seemed particularly fond of the painting.

38
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,170
Is there a way to contact the guest?

39
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,700
Okay, I'll check.

40
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,980
Zhang, give Mr. Yang a call.

41
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,320
Will do.

42
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,080
At first, our boss wasn't going to sell it.

43
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,670
Because he had picked out the painting himself.

44
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,380
The mood really suited the restaurant well.

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,530
See? Till now, our boss preferred to leave the wall empty

46
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,830
because he couldn't find a good replacement.

47
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,900
If that's the case, why did your boss sell the painting?

48
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,610
From what I recall, that night,

49
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,560
the customer had a long talk with the boss.

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
He finally convinced him.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,050
I figured, since he loves Miss Han's work so much,

52
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,440
he must have a special reason.

53
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,920
Then please help me get in touch with him. I'd appreciate it.

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,850
Okay, I will.

55
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,070
Thank you.

56
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,670
Little girl, are your parents home?

57
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,040
What is it, Keke?

58
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,070
Someone's looking for you.

59
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,270
Looking for me? Do you know them?

60
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,340
No.

61
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,720
Come.

62
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,600
Hello. Are you Mr. Liu?

63
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,510
The painting is with me.

64
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,190
If you need it to prove your point,

65
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm willing to help.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Thank you. I'm truly grateful.

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,230
I should be the one thanking you.

68
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,610
The painting is upstairs. Come, I'll show you.

69
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,160
This is my daughter's room.

70
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,230
The painting has always been placed here.

71
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,670
When I first saw it, it was at a restaurant.

72
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,630
There was a stain in one corner.

73
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,520
I bought it and did some simple restoration.

74
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,790
May I know why you picked this painting?

75
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,340
Actually, this painting was chosen by my daughter.

76
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,820
Right?

77
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,350
Which pot are you watering?

78
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,920
This one first, then that. Those two.

79
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,760
Okay. You do it, I'll watch you.

80
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,950
I haven't seen my girl so happy in a long time.

81
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,570
Is Keke usually not happy?

82
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,570
Actually, when she was two,

83
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,540
her mother passed away in an accident.

84
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,640
She was still very young then.

85
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,520
But I think that one saying is so true.

86
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,080
The mother and daughter's hearts are connected.

87
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,690
From then on, no one could raise the child.

88
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,120
I had to do it myself.

89
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,470
So I raised her alone while working.

90
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,480
It must have been a tough time for you.

91
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,170
Thinking about it now,

92
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,280
it was basically a nightmare.

93
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,850
When my girl started crying,

94
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,200
no one could coax her to stop.

95
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,410
One time, I ran out of ideas. So I decided to take her for a ride.

96
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,920
We happened to pass by a restaurant and went inside.

97
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,160
There, you saw the painting.

98
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,030
The painting was hung right beside our table.

99
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,510
Keke was still crying when we arrived at the restaurant.

100
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,690
But the moment she saw your painting, she stopped crying.

101
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,460
Incredible, right?

102
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,040
Thinking back, it still feels very surreal.

103
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,640
Do you think it was a coincidence?

104
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:40,210
I think it was fate.

105
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,180
I brought her back there a few more times.

106
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,980
Every time she saw the painting,

107
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,930
she would immediately quiet down.

108
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,760
Same with me.

109
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,900
Whenever I see the painting, I feel a sense of warmth.

110
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,280
As if I'm being healed.

111
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,600
Miss Han, I can tell that this painting is probably one of your earlier works.

112
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,560
A good piece of artwork is not all about its technique.

113
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,010
What's more important is the emotions it portrays.

114
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,200
That's the reason why I had to buy the painting.

115
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,500
That's why I said, I should be the one thanking you.

116
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,530
Your painting accompanied Keke and me

117
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,350
through a very tough period.

118
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,110
It has a special meaning in our family.

119
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,310
I never would have expected that my painting could be of such use.

120
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,010
I'm delighted to hear about it from you.

121
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,910
Your painting gave a lot of courage to my family.

122
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,880
Hopefully, the same courage could help you get back on your feet again.

123
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,980
Keke.

124
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,080
Keke, come here.

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
Listen to Daddy.

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,420
Your favorite painting was done by this lady.

127
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,350
Miss, for you.

128
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,080
Thank you.

129
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,050
Can you teach me how to draw birds?

130
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,610
Of course.

131
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,960
Keke, what about the other two guests?

132
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,670
This is a lemon flower. For Miss Ning Meng.

133
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,540
Thanks, Keke.

134
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,740
This is a bitter melon flower. For the mister with the long face.

135
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,250
Keke, don't be cheeky.

136
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,150
Thanks.

137
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,990
It's getting late. Why don't you all stay the night at my place?

138
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,750
We don't want to intrude.

139
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,500
It's no trouble. You guys might not know.

140
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,180
These days, there have been thunderstorms in the mountain.

141
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,400
Leaving at this hour might not be very safe.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,590
Besides, I think my daughter enjoys your company.

143
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm hoping you guys could stay a while longer with her.

144
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Miss, stay with me for a night.

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,840
I want to play with you.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,340
It's up to Miss Han.

147
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,910
Well...

148
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,710
All right then.

149
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,500
Pretty lady, You Qi. I won't be going back tonight.

150
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll be back tomorrow. Don't worry.

151
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,000
- Miss Han.
- You're still up.

152
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
The air here is great.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,300
Feels bad to sleep.

154
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,800
Look! You can even see the stars.

155
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,800
It's beautiful.

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Ning Meng, I really want to thank you.

157
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Don't say that. I didn't do much.

158
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Actually, I should thank you

159
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,700
for painting such a great piece of art.

160
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,300
Still, I'd like to know.

161
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you really think my paintings are that great?

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,600
Of course.

163
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,400
I told you before.

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
I don't know much about paintings.

165
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
But when I saw your work,

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I could feel what it was trying to portray.

167
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,000
It gave off warmth and energy.

168
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,000
You know what? Before I came back,

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,500
I had stopped painting for a long time.

170
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,600
I couldn't find the will to create something.

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,200
But this incident really gave me a big boost.

172
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
Right now, I have this urge.

173
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
The urge to draw.

174
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,800
I get it. It's like when I find a good project,

175
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
I can't help but want to invest.

176
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
I get so excited.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Yes, that's right. That's the feeling.

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,400
Looks like making investments and doing art

179
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
have some similarities.

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,100
Yes, surely.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm so glad. This means it won't be long

182
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,400
before I get to see new work from you.

183
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Hopefully so.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
You can do it, Meng.

185
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,000
You'll surely become a great painter.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
You can do it, too.

187
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,400
You'll definitely become a great investor.

188
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
A great investor?

189
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
All right, sure.

190
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll take it as a good omen.

191
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,600
Well, I'll leave you be.

192
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm going to bed.

193
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Okay, goodnight.

194
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm going to stay a bit longer.

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,200
You're good at comforting others.

196
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour

197
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,800
but eavesdropping on others?

198
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Eavesdropping on who?

199
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
You talk too loudly.

200
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,000
I couldn't sleep.

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,300
Sure, I got it. I'm leaving now.

202
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,900
You can have your peace and quiet.

203
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,680
Hey!

204
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,900
What?

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,300
Thank you.

206
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,200
Meng's already said it.

207
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
That was from her.

208
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
This "thank you" is from me.

209
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay, it's well-received.

210
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,700
Good night then.

211
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
Good night.

212
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,600
Mr. Liu, once the matter is resolved,

213
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
I will return the painting immediately.

214
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,900
No worries. Just tell me if you need anything else in the future.

215
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Miss, this is for you.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,500
Thank you. The flower is lovely.

217
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Miss, will you often come to play with me?

218
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Sure. I'll visit you often. Okay?

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,900
Keke, come.

220
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
Time to say goodbye.

221
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,200
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

222
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,500
-Bye.
- We're off.

223
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,800
- Okay. See you.
- Thank you.

224
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,400
- We're off.
- Bye.

225
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Ning Meng.

226
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Mr. Lu. Miss Han.

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,100
Senior, what are you doing here?

228
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,300
I called you but couldn't get through. So I asked You Qi.

229
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
You Qi said you were here.

230
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
The signal isn't very good here.

231
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm just glad you're okay.

232
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Have you settled the problem?

233
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,800
It's done. Thanks for your concern, Mr. Su.

234
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
We're heading back now.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,300
Ning Meng, get in.

236
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Mingming.

237
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll take my senior's car.

238
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,400
See you later.

239
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
Come.

240
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
We're leaving, Mr. Lu. Bye.

241
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,100
Take care on the road.

242
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,100
Let's go.

243
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,400
Did you have a good rest last night?

244
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,100
You could adjust the seat and have a nap.

245
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm good. I slept well.

246
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,500
Sorry, Senior, for troubling you to come all this way.

247
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,600
Ning Meng, it's all good with you.

248
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
But your habit of always apologizing needs to be changed.

249
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,500
Are you hungry?

250
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,000
I bought you some food.

251
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
- There are cakes and juice. Can you get them?
- I'll do it.

252
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,800
The mountain road is bumpy.

253
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
Check the cake.

254
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,400
Is it still intact.

255
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
It's fine.

256
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,700
Senior, you eat. I'll feed you.

257
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,600
No need to be so polite with me. You eat.

258
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
But it's a three-hour drive back to Shanghai.

259
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
Why don't I drive later?

260
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,000
Just sit back and eat your cake.

261
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Last night, I met up with some friends

262
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
who were visiting in the vicinity.

263
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,300
You don't know. There were thunderstorms in northern Zhejiang in the past two days.

264
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,400
Landslides occurred in a few places on Mount Mogan.

265
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,600
When I heard you were on the mountain, I got worried.

266
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,500
Eat. I'll drive slower.

267
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't worry. I won't suddenly brake.

268
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,700
Thank you, Senior.

269
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,400
You're welcome.

270
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
- Ning Meng.
- Senior.

271
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,200
You go ahead.

272
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
You were so quiet, I worried you were sleepy.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
I'm not sleepy. I'm fine.

274
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,200
If you're tired, tell me.

275
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
We can chat to keep you awake.

276
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,800
Okay. Then, let's have a quick chat.

277
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,500
A quick chat won't last us till Shanghai.

278
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Not even halfway.

279
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,100
Let me tell you some jokes.

280
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm really good at that.

281
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,900
I didn't know you had such a skill.

282
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,400
I thought you only knew how to answer additional questions.

283
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,200
I even gave a performance at our school's New Year's gala.

284
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Answering additional questions?

285
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,600
Telling jokes.

286
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,800
I'll tell you one.

287
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Dad told me.

288
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,100
<i>If someone bullied you,</i>

289
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
<i>hit them with a shovel.</i>

290
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,500
<i>I asked him, but I'm a girl.</i>

291
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,700
<i>He said, then use a pink shovel to hit them.</i>

292
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,900
Mingming, are you okay?

293
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
I'm fine.

294
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,300
Why didn't you keep Ning Meng at your company?

295
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000
Why do you ask?

296
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
It's nothing.

297
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
I just think she's quite nice.

298
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,500
She's smart and meticulous. And has a sunny personality.

299
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,200
It seems like nothing could stop her.

300
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,700
She's not too bad.

301
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
She just has bad taste.

302
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,800
You seem to dislike Su Weiran.

303
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,000
I wouldn't say dislike.

304
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We're just now the same.

305
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,600
So, you don't want Ning Meng to be with him.

306
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,400
She can be with whoever she likes.

307
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
It doesn't concern me.

308
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Thanks a lot, Senior.

309
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,300
Go in.

310
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Ning Meng.

311
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Have a good rest.

312
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,700
What do you think, Miss Han?

313
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
Looks good.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,100
The reproduction of the colors and details is good.

315
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
- What do you think, Mr. Lu?
- Pretty good.

316
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,900
I'll make the first order of 30 treadmills.

317
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll gift them to our clients for them to try out.

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,900
Thirty?

319
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,400
That's not a problem.

320
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

321
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,300
Actually, we owe Ning Meng the biggest thank you in this matter.

322
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,000
That's right.

323
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,900
Ning Meng is Mobi's most significant contributor.

324
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,500
From pre-investment preparations to post-management, she's done a lot.

325
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,100
Not at all. It's only my duty.

326
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,800
By the way, if everyone is free,

327
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,000
what about I treat you all to dinner?

328
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,700
We already have an appointment tonight.

330
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,400
Right, Mingming?

331
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,500
It's no problem. We can meet another time.

332
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,400
Okay.

333
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
Okay, we'll make our move then.

334
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
You're leaving?

335
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
Okay.

336
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
See you around.

337
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
We won't keep you.

338
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay, see you.

339
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,900
See you.

340
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,400
We're leaving.

341
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Take care.

342
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,500
Hello, Senior.

343
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,300
<i>Are you free this weekend?</i>

344
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,400
<i>Would you like to make a trip to the campus?</i>

345
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,100
To the campus?

346
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,500
<i>This Sunday morning, I'll be giving a talk at the recruitment fair at our uni.</i>

347
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
<i>We could check out the campus in the afternoon. What do you think?</i>

348
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
<i>I haven't been back since I went overseas.</i>

349
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
<i>What about you?</i>

350
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,700
Me too. I've never been back since I graduated.

351
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,000
<i>Great then.</i>

352
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
<i>Join me if you're free.</i>

353
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,900
Okay.

354
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,200
<i>See you this weekend. Bye.</i>

355
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,900
Bye-bye.

356
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,400
I won!

357
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,500
The sun must have risen from the west.

358
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,600
I won.

359
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Not bad, aren't I?

360
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,200
Am I dreaming? Pinch me.

361
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,600
Oh, shut up. Step aside.

362
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
What's the matter?

363
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,700
I heard the problem with Meng's painting has already been resolved.

364
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,000
Who told you that?

365
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm a limited partner in the Mobi project. Did you forget?

366
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
Oh, right.

367
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,700
What is it? You've been out of sorts the whole night.

368
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,900
What? Did Meng's artistic aura make you lose your sanity?

369
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,700
A little bit.

370
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,300
She told me...

371
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,900
that she'd give our relationship a go.

372
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
What did you say?

373
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,900
I didn't hear you. Say it again.

374
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,800
Did I hear correctly?

375
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,700
Isn't this what you've been dreaming of?

376
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,000
What's with the expression? Stunned?

377
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,000
Honestly, I've waited over a decade for her to say those words.

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
When she said it herself,

379
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,600
I thought I'd be overjoyed to hear it.

380
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,000
But it wasn't like what I imagined.

381
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
I understand.

382
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,900
If you really feel lost,

383
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,000
I can help direct you.

384
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,200
How about a round of rapid-fire questions?

385
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
This is based on psychological findings.

386
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Choose one of the two. Let's begin.

387
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,000
- Invest or shop?
- Invest.

388
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
- Fencing or swimming?
- Fencing.

389
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,600
- Ning Meng or Meng?
- Ning...

390
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,400
Miss.

391
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,000
- Ms. Ning? Who is Ms. Ning?
- Ning Meng's sister?

392
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,600
That doesn't count. Childish.

393
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,600
I think you should tell Meng

394
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
your honest feelings as soon as possible.

395
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
It's not too late.

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
No.

397
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,400
She only just pulled herself together.

398
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,700
I...

399
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,100
Who's the one being childish?

400
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Did you really think you're some grateful child repaying a deed?

401
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Do you know for sure if your feelings for Meng are one of love or familial?

402
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,000
Actually, you know it deep down.

403
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But you won't admit it.

404
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Look at your face right now.

405
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,700
It's scrunched up like a cinnamon roll.

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Say you do end up with Meng.

407
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,000
Do you think you two will be happy?

408
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm done talking.

409
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,200
- Let's spar.
- Forget it.

410
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,400
Your condition is bad.

411
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
Let's just go drink. Come on.

412
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,900
Let's go.

413
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,900
Hey, Yuhang, it's Yimeng.

414
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Is Mingming with you?

415
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,200
<i>Hasn't he gone home? That can't be.</i>

416
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
<i>I saw the designated driver picking him up.</i>

417
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,800
<i>Listen, Meng. Don't worry.</i>

418
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
<i>I'll call him.</i>

419
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,600
Okay.

420
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,300
Mingming, what...

421
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,700
What are you doing here?

422
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
Hello, Yuhang?

423
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,000
He's home. It's all right.

424
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,300
Okay.

425
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
Why didn't you go in?

426
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,700
I wanted to sober up first.

427
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,800
Come, let's go inside.

428
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Can you get up?

429
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,000
Here, slowly.

430
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,200
Why did you drink so much?

431
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,900
Are you feeling okay?

432
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm fine.

433
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,100
I'll just stay here for a bit by myself.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,800
Mingming, have you been feeling down lately?

435
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,400
I don't want Meng to feel bad.

436
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,800
You're awake.

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,400
I drank a lot last night.

438
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Sorry about that.

439
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's fine.

440
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,100
You and Yuhang hadn't hung out in a while.

441
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,400
It's okay to drink.

442
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Are you all right? Do you have a headache?

443
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,800
No, I'm all right.

444
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,500
Mingming, accompany me to a place.

445
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,100
Okay.

446
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,700
I haven't skated in years. I've gotten rusty.

447
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,300
Looks okay to me.

448
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,100
I remember when we were kids, we would come here to skate every week.

449
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,900
I could hardly recognize the place after the renovation.

450
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,300
Look. Is that the man who coached us when we were little?

451
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,900
I think so.

452
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,200
But he looks much older.

453
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,300
That's for sure.

454
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,400
It's been so long.

455
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,800
Whoever it is, they'd all have aged.

456
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,700
I remember him being really fierce.

457
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,200
One time, he scolded you until you cried.

458
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
You got so angry.

459
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
You said you'd never go to his lesson again.

460
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,100
After that, you only wanted me to teach you.

461
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,200
That's...

462
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,700
Are you sure that happened?

463
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,000
How come I don't remember?

464
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,000
It's been a while since I came back.

465
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,700
This time around,

466
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,900
everything seems quite familiar

467
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,400
and yet they've also changed.

468
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,100
Mingming, thanks for keeping me company all this while.

469
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,200
You had kept me company in the past.

470
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,800
Now it's my turn to return the favor.

471
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,900
Then, how long will you stay with me?

472
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,800
There are things that can't be measured this way.

473
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Did you realize? During this period,

474
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,500
you weren't actually happy.

475
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
No. Why would you say that?

476
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,700
Whether or not someone is truly happy cannot be hidden.

477
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,500
I can tell. Many times,

478
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,000
you were just being considerate of my feelings.

479
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,500
That's not true.

480
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,700
I did it willingly.

481
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,900
What if I'm not willing?

482
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,600
I want you to be happy.

483
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
A relationship has to be mutual.

484
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,600
It's not about one party giving everything unconditionally to the other.

485
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,200
It might work for a while

486
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,700
but it's not going to last forever.

487
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,300
I don't really understand what you're saying.

488
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,400
I still remember how you looked when you first came to our house.

489
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,200
At the time, I really wanted a little brother.

490
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,000
So during those years,

491
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,600
I really did think of you as my brother.

492
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,900
I know.

493
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,000
Later, when you were in high school,

494
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,200
you told me...

495
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
You told me you liked me.

496
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,700
I was really surprised.

497
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,800
But to be honest, when it happened,

498
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,700
I was a little touched.

499
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
But you were so young

500
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,600
and I was about to go abroad, so...

501
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
The timing was all wrong.

502
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,700
After so many years,

503
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,000
I thought you had forgotten about it.

504
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,600
Until that day,

505
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,900
Zeng Yuhang told me in the car

506
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,100
that you've been waiting for me all this while.

507
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,300
Turns out you've not changed at all.

508
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,300
So I was wondering.

509
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,700
Maybe we could make up for the regret

510
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,400
of what we missed then.

511
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Before this,

512
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,900
I really hoped this day would come.

513
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
But I'm not sure why...

514
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,800
I do.

515
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Because once you miss it, it's gone.

516
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,300
It's too late and you can't turn back time.

517
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,500
Perhaps it's because we've both grown up.

518
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Mingming, I know what it is you're hiding from.

519
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
It's not that you didn't change.

520
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,800
It's that you don't want to admit that you've changed.

521
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
Because you're afraid that by admitting it,

522
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,800
it will be like a betrayal to yourself.

523
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,600
But a person being honest to themselves

524
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,200
is not a betrayal.

525
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,800
Rather, it's being truthful.

526
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,000
Respect your feelings.

527
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And make a sincere decision.

528
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,700
That's the only way to avoid any regrets.

529
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Thank you, Meng.

530
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,200
So there's nothing to be sad about.

531
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,000
The past beautiful memories will always be there.

532
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,900
No one can take it away or change it.

533
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Now, it's time for us to move forward.

534
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,800
<i>Go get it! Go. Go.</i>

535
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,000
<i>Here he comes.</i>

536
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Senior scores!</i>

537
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
<i>What are you doing? This is your chance.</i>

538
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,500
<i>Hurry up!</i>

539
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,300
Nice shot.

540
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,000
You're here.

541
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,700
I'll stop here.

542
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,300
Senior.

543
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,400
Let's find a place to sit down.

544
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
Let's go.

545
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,900
- We can sit here.
- Okay.

546
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,200
It's changed quite a lot.

547
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

548
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
Did my skills worsen?

549
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
You're still as good as ever.

550
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,500
I haven't played in a long time.

551
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,000
I just found my touch again.

552
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,300
Back then, you were our school's MVP.

553
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,800
You led us to an intercollegiate championship.

554
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,500
The last three-pointer in the final match was scored by you.

555
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,600
You went to that match, too?

556
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,200
Of course.

557
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,700
I remember we were the away team.

558
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,000
The crowd was booing at us and we were being dunked.

559
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yes, at the time, I felt the referee was being unfair.

560
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,800
I was so mad watching the game.

561
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,900
Thinking back, such unfairness really was commonplace.

562
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,600
But at the time, I had a fire in me.

563
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,800
I couldn't accept anything else but a win.

564
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,600
Have you ever thought,

565
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,900
what if that last shot didn't go in?

566
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,100
I'll be honest with you. I haven't.

567
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,200
I'm not sure why.

568
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,400
At that moment, I had a really strong intuition.

569
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
That I would be able to score the shot.

570
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,600
And I was going to win the match.

571
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,800
<i>Here's a song dedicated to all the young people</i>

572
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,400
<i>who are bravely chasing their dreams.</i>

573
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
<i>"The brightest star in the sky"</i>

574
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,200
Do you remember this?

575
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,400
The CD you gifted me had this song.

576
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,000
- This was my favorite song on the CD.
- Mine, too.

577
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
♫ <i>The hopeful person</i> ♫

578

♫ <i>Their loneliness and sighs</i> ♫

579
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,900
That day...

580
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,700
That day,

581
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,200
you saw me with your senior. Right?

582
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,700
♫ <i>I pray to have a transparent soul</i> ♫

583

584
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,800
<i>I'm off. Bye-bye.</i>

585
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>- You're here. Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.</i>

586
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,200
<i>Will you eat with me later then?</i>

587
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
<i>Sure.</i>

588
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,600
Come on. Let's go check the classrooms.

589
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,400
Okay. Which way is it?

590
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
That way.

591
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,600
Right.

592
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,400
Let's go.

593
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
Is this the classroom?

594
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,300
Yes.

595
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,200
Back then... Let me see.

596
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,500
I think I sat... Right here.

597
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,900
This was where I sat.

598
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,800
Right.

599
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
Now I remember.

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,600
Senior.

601
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,100
Why were you so sure I did not cheat that time?

602
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,700
The cheat sheet had a lot of wrong answers.

603
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,300
But you got them right on your paper.

604
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,200
You also got the additional question correct.

605
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
That question was set by the lecturer and me.

606
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,000
For someone who could answer it,

607
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
why the need to cheat?

608
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,400
How nice.

609
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,600
Feels like we're back to our student days.

610
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,100
Yes.

611
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,400
Can I tell you about what happened...

612
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,700
