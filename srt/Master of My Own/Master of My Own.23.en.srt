3
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,190
I'm afraid you'll have to find a new investor.

4
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,000
Ning Meng,

5
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm giving you two options here.

6
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,410
First, do as I say

7
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,300
and give me 10% stakes.

8
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,980
I'll give you a high commission fee.

9
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,050
Second, I won't invest in this project anymore.

10
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,600
Since it doesn't bring me any losses anyway.

11
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,900
I understand.

12
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,770
For everyone's convenience,

13
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,110
I'll pick the second option.

14
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,470
I think we've made the most appropriate choice.

15
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,000
If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave.

16
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,270
Goodbye.

17
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,650
He was obviously trying to bribe me.

18
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,120
So what did you say?

19
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,570
I rejected his offer.

20
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,030
Worse comes to worst, I'll find a new LP.

21
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,500
This kind of thing is pretty normal.

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,780
For you to experience it,

23
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,830
means you're a great investor.

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,090
Senior, how would you choose if you were me?

25
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,260
Mr. Zhou asked for 10%.

26
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,550
It's not worth it since it's not that much money.

27
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,540
Does it mean it's worth it if it's a lot?

28
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,390
That's not what I mean.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,350
What matters isn't the amount.

30
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,500
I can't cross this bottom line.

31
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,920
I support that you stick to your bottom line.

32
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,920
It's just changing an LP.

33
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,060
It's not a big problem for you, Ms. Ning.

34
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,330
That's right.

35
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,980
It's better than going against my principle and losing the initiative.

36
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,270
Then you have nothing to worry about.

37
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,860
Let's go out and relax tonight.

38
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,810
Where are we going?

39
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,010
There's a great stand-up comedy tonight.

40
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,520
You like making jokes, right?

41
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,260
We can learn from it.

42
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,670
Okay.

43
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
I may not look smart.

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,930
But I attended university, too.

45
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,350
But the ratio of men to women at our university was about seven to one.

46
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,390
That means if a man wants to get a girlfriend,

47
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,780
it's as difficult as The Calabash Brothers saving the grandpa.
<i>(A Chinese animation TV series)</i>

<i>Then all the guys would do their best to confess their feelings.</i>

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,230
<i>Also, there are some guys who would shout from downstairs,</i>

50
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,350
<i>but they'd be too scared to go alone.</i>

51
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,590
<i>They'd bring along their friends</i>

52
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,460
<i>with some bringing party poppers.</i>

53
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>So when you looked from a distance,</i>

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,950
<i>you thought they were going to a fight.</i>

55
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,970
<i>Then those guys would think they were romantic.</i>

56
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,040
<i>But the girls were actually more romantic.</i>

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,550
<i>Also, there were some even stranger ones</i>

58
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>who would sing downstairs of the girl's dorm.</i>

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,830
I think confessing your feelings through singing isn't a bad idea.

60
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,640
But don't you think it was a bold move

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,950
to sing "Ugly Person" to confess their feelings?

62
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,490
My friend, are you rushing to confess your feelings?

63
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,040
I wish you the best of luck.

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,600
Isn't that Mr. Lu?

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,790
<i>Sir, don't look at him.</i>

66
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,530
<i>I'm the main attraction here, okay?</i>

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,440
I think so.

68
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,870
Aren't you going to say hi to him?

69
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,550
It's okay. He has already left.

70
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,920
<i>There were also those who sent text messages to girls, right?</i>

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
<i>But he wasn't alone when he did it.</i>

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>He was pushing his friends around him to help him send the text messages.</i>

73
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,830
<i>He thought the messages weren't enough.</i>

74
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,640
<i>So he went to the plaza to get those elderly to help him send the messages.</i>

75
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,270
Was he...

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,870
the one you mentioned who made you feel puzzled?

77
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,670
Yes.

78
00:05:53,390 --> 00:06:00,760
- But it doesn't matter who it is anymore. Since...
- Okay.

79
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,320
I understand.

80
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,140

Mr. Liu is pretty suitable.

He's a big player in the internet industry; loaded and generous.

He's a great LP.

I agree. But for a big shot like Mr. Liu,

it may be too insignificant for him to invest in Lehui.

Only you could think this thoroughly.

How do I make profits from investing in this project?

106
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,960
First of all, I can introduce projects relating to hotels and condominiums.

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,130
I can let you be their customized furniture supplier.

I'll let you make a profit in your business.

109
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,760
I'll have to know what kind of hotel and condominium projects they are.

110
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,850
The project investor, Mr. Liang, is someone I used to work with on Mobi's project.

111
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,130
He mainly focuses his investments in medium to high-end hotels

112
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,900
and serviced apartments targeting the young people market.

113
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,390
I can send the details to you later.

114
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,250
Besides, I did mention you to him before this.

115
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,680
He absolutely approves of the Kirin brand.

116
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,770
As long as you nod your head, we can start discussing the details.

117
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,100
I can't say yes to merely this one condition.

118
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,420
I haven't told you about the second advantage.

119
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,640
Okay, I'm all ears.

120
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,610
After you have helped Lehui Appliances to set a foothold in the market,

121
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,730
Lehui will include Kirin Furniture

122
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,720
in all of their marketing campaigns for free.

123
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,940
Both brands join together to promote each other.

124
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,030
In other words, it'll also save Kirin Furniture's advertising costs.

125
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,900
I get it now.

126
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,660
You're using my advertising expenditures in a different way

127
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,340
to return Kirin Furniture a favor.

128
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,000
And also achieve a value-added effect

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,220
because you've already made profits from the hotels and condominiums' projects.

130
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,340
Marvelous.

131
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,710
So what do you think about these types of affiliations?

132
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,400
- I'm in.
- That's great.

133
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,690
- Mr. Tang.
- Yes.

138
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,960
Success!

139
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,220
Ms. Shi, Tang Zhengwang will invest instead of Mr. Zhou.

140
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,360
Mr. Liang and Mr. Tang will invest with a ratio of one-to-one as LPs

141
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,180
to form a limited partnership with Lehui,

142
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,450
which still accounts for 20% of the stakes.

143
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,390
Nothing will go wrong this time.

144
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,490
When I heard there were some issues with Mr. Zhou,

145
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,240
I was worried.

146
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,790
But I gave it a thought.

147
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,990
Since I let you take charge of this task, I should trust you.

148
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,320
I didn't expect you to solve it so quickly.

149
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,330
You even thought of integrating resources.

150
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,920
You're becoming more mature now.

151
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,980
I also admire the fact you put the company's interests first

152
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,730
when Mr. Zhou tried to bribe you.

153
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,150
Ms. Shi, it's my job.

154
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,940
You've given me so many opportunities.

155
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,180
I'll never let you down.

156

158
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,110
How long has Mr. Lu been like this?

159
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,410
More than an hour. It felt like the time had stopped.

160
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,150
He lost weight.

161
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,180
He looks haggard, too.

His face is wrinkled, too.

163
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,490
His dark circles are getting worse, too.

164
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,130
He's moving! Go in now.

165
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,650
Why are you looking at me this way?

166
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,310
I'm not a panda.

167
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,990
We're concerned about you, so we especially came to see you.

168
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,980
Making sure nothing has happened to you.

169
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,640
What could happen to me?

170
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,100
Mingming, stop trying to act tough in front of us.

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,300
It hurts to be dumped, right?

172
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,450
Especially for someone like you...

173
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,360
who had to suffer from losing her because you were clueless.

174
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,370
Why did you tell her everything?

175
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,750
Don't blame him.

176
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,850
We had promised not to keep any secrets between us.

177
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,330
Right?

178
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,130
Are you here to comfort him or to show how happy we are?

179
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,480
Mingming, let's go and have fun.

180
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,680
You haven't been to the RV park I've developed.

181
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,130
- That's right.
- No, thank you.

182
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,040
Why not? It's fun.

183
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,590
Not interested.

184
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,590
What do you want to do, then? We'll hang out with you.

185
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,250
I only want to focus on my work and make money.

186
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,740
Focus on work, huh?

187
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,620
There's something you need to know, too.

188
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,550
A company has been purchasing your father's company, Qinhe's stock

189
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,000
in the secondary market.

190
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,470
I also heard the relationship between your father and Lu Guoyu

191
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,220
is getting more hostile.

192
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,980
What is that old man up to?

193
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,280
Mr. Lu, you have a meeting with Ms. Shi this afternoon.

194
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,420
- I'll be right over.
- You're still going to Eaglestone Capital?

195
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,710
What else can I do?

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,840
I can't stop working because of this matter, right?

197
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,420
See you.

198
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,230
Ya, can you give me a bottle of Yakult? I'm too lazy to buy one.

199
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,040
Here you go.

200
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,210
Did you hear? There's a company that keeps buying Qinhe's shares lately.

201
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,220
What is it called again?

202
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,040
Shuangxun? Yes, Shuangxun Group.

203
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,890
Do you know who the chairman is of Qinhe?

204
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,570
Lu Tianxing.

205
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,550
He's Mr. Lu's father.

206
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,400
Really? I've never heard Mr. Lu talk about it before.

207
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Ning Meng, you're close to Mr. Lu.

208
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,590
Do you have any inside information?

209
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,130
- No idea.
- Speaking of the devil, isn't that Mr. Lu?

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,140
Mr. Lu, you're already here?

211
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,140
Ning Meng, help me attend to Mr. Lu.

212
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,980
I'll go and get changed.

213
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,680
Ms. Shi, I just remembered

214
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,610
I had an appointment with Ms. Liu of Lehui. I have to go now.

215
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,630
Ya, please attend to Mr. Lu.

216
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,960
Okay.

217
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,010
Mr. Lu, this way, please.

218
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,310
What do you want to drink? I'll prepare it for you.

219
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,660
- Coffee?
- Anything's fine.

220
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,180
Okay.

221
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,200
<i>[The Nine]</i>

222
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,340
I wouldn't be able to sign this contract if it weren't for you.

223
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,230
I should be treating you to a meal.

224
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,840
But you paid for it.

225
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,510
It's all right. You're too generous.

226
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,140
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting today.

227
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,380
No, I came early.

228
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,100
Besides, we're talking about business.

229
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,300
I can apply for reimbursement.

230
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,840
When we meet up in private next time, you'll be treating me then.

231
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,110
That's a deal, okay? You better not get the check next time.

232
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,510
Okay.

233
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,130
I won't be seeing you off then.

234
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,670
I'll have to wait for the receipt.

235
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,090
Okay, thank you very much.

236
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,270
- You're welcome.
- I'll see you next time.

237
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,210
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

238
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,920
Hello, is my receipt ready?

239
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,160
Please wait for a moment.

240
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,610
Not bad, right?

241
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,350
Perfect.

242
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,700
- Not bad, right?
- Quite decent.

243
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,720
Where are we going next?

244
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,740
Let's play cards while getting sober.

245
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,150
What do you think?

246
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,410
Mr. Qiu, I'll make the arrangement.

247
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,680
It's arranged. It's all arranged.

248
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,470
Miss, your receipt.

249
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,250
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

250
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,070
What's wrong? What's with the sigh?

251
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm just a little panicky.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,730
Do you think I should tell You Qi about Old He?

253
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,840
What can you tell her without any evidence?

254
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,060
I'm scared Old He is cheating behind You Qi's back.

255
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,760
Perhaps you've misunderstood the situation.

256
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,130
Didn't you say it wasn't just the two of them?

257
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,760
There were others there.

258
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,230
Are you free this weekend?

259
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,660
I want to ask them out for a meal?

260
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,520
You can help me observe Old He at the same time.

261
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,860
I can't make it this weekend.

262
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,750
I have an appointment with my client.

263
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,290
I'll pick you up after it's over.

264
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,680
Okay.

265
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,440
But I suggest that you handle this matter carefully.

266
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,690
One mistake, it'll affect your friendship with You Qi.

267
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
- Hello, here's your stir-fried shredded beef.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,920
Thank you.

269
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,100
Mengmeng, why are you suddenly buying us a meal?

270
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,240
Isn't it normal that I treat you to a meal?

271
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,600
Fortunately, Old He is free too.

272
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,720
I didn't expect I would be so lucky to join you.

273
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,360
Of course.

274
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,950
Mengmeng said to ask you along.

275
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,320
- Really?
- With his current status and position,

276
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,680
if I want to see him, I have to go

277
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,780
through the receptionist and the assistant manager to see him.

278
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,650
Ning Meng, you're not a stranger.

279
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,290
You're Qiqi's best friend.

280
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,110
With our relationship, I'll always have time for you as long as you come and see me.

281
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,700
- Great.
- Old He.

282
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,630
Let's eat. I ordered all your favorite dishes today.

283
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,330
I'll peel them for you. You did a manicure, right?

284
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,880
- You'll just eat.
- Okay.

285
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,810
That's great.

286
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,330
Eat something else first.

287
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,850
Old He, do you know Qiu Junlin?

288
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,620
Who?

289
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,220
It's nothing. He was my co-worker.

290
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,750
I saw you together when I had lunch the other day.

291
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,690
I wanted to tell you to watch out for him if you know him.

292
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,420
Qiu Junlin?

293
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,210
Mengmeng, is he the one

294
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,180
who set you up and made you quit?

295
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,310
He's a bad person.

296
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,080
Old He, don't be friends with him.

297
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,910
I remember now.

298
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:29,170
If you didn't mention that he was your co-worker,

299
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,960
I'd have thought he was the driver.

300
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,500
This is so spicy.

301
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,230
Drink some water.

302
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,740
- But it's tasty.
- It's probably too hot.

303
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,210
- It's too spicy.
- Drink it later. It's still hot.

304
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,560
He is still so thoughtful.

305
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,610
- It's great.
- It's my duty.

306
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,310
Hello, your spicy crayfish is here.

307
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,030
Excuse me. Please wait for a moment.

308
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,700
- I'm so sorry.
- Careful. It's hot.

309
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,630
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

310
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,910
- I'll get some ointment for you.
- It's okay.

311
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,900
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

312
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,180
I'm okay.

313
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,660
Wipe it quickly.

314
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,130
- That was close.
- Let me see.

315
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,140
I'm glad you're okay.

316
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,640
Look how red your hand is.

317
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,630
I'm fine.

318
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,280
I'll blow it for you.

319
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,130
It's okay. He'll send the ointment later.

320
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,700
- Does it hurt?
- I'm fine.

321
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,580
How did it go? Are you relieved now?

322
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,080
Their relationship is still the same.

323
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,580
Maybe I overthought.

324
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,430
I was a little envious seeing how anxious you were just now.

325
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,200
I wonder if you'll care about me this much.

326
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,310
Would you do anything that makes me feel insecure?

327
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,640
I guarantee that I won't.

328
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,500
Did I spoil the mood?

329
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,100
No.

330
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,110
Let's try it again.

331
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,470
I promise on Oriental Pearl Tower that I'll stop hiding.

332
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,090
Why do you sound like you're dying a martyr?

333
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,750
But it's adorable.

334
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,860
It's okay. I'll wait.

335
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,780
I'll wait until you want to accept me.

336
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,580
Morning.

337
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,320
- Morning, Ning Meng.
- Morning.

338
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,880
They're the ones with the problems.

339
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,030
Even if that's the case, you can't talk to them with such an attitude.

340
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,680
Why should I keep quiet and endure it?

341
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,680
They're the ones who are uncivilized.

342
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,290
Enough.

343
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,170
Go and calm yourself down.

344
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,170
What's going on?

345
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,930
A new employee. Young and vigorous.

346
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,530
He thinks he's a professional, so he argued with the LP until they were upset.

347
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,130
So they complained to Ms. Shi.

348
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,590
Is Ms. Shi okay?

349
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,190
How could she be okay?

350
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,200
It wasn't easy to accumulate these network resources.

351
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,780
Ms. Shi will have to apologize to them one by one to restore the relationship.

352
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,620
It'll take a lot of effort.

353
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,290
Ning Meng.

354
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:32,090
- Ms. Shi.
- Ning Meng, sit.

355
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,500
Young people nowadays are so self-centered.

356
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,290
Their working ability can't be questioned at all.

357
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,500
I remember when you just joined us, you did a public placement.

358
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,300
You did very well at the time.

359
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,200
I made several mistakes when I first did it.

360
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,670
But you gave me a chance to make up for it.

361
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,010
Compared to this guy, your mistakes were nothing.

362
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,620
Ning Meng,

363
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,610
this project is progressing pretty well now.

364
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,300
If there's a need to follow up with this project,

365
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,030
can you help out?

366
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,740
After all, you are good at maintaining relationships with clients.

367
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,550
Is this the project that we collaborated on with Joint Capital?

368
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,990
Yes.

369
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,240
Ning Meng,

370
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,290
are you dating Su Weiran?

371
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,400
As someone who has some experience, I'll share something with you.

372
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,160
Sometimes, hiding is useless

373
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,560
if you don't want to have anything to do with him.

374
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,600
It's better to get along naturally while letting nature take its course.

375
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,670
Anything that shouldn't happen is bound to end anyway.

376
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,060
If it's not meant to end, it's useless no matter where you hide.

377
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,180
This is the fate of people.

378
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,340
The truth is, I can assign this task to someone else.

379
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,190
But we have a strategic collaboration with Mr. Lu.

380
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,770
Are you planning to hide from him forever?

381
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,700
I think...

382
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,900
it's better to let everything flow naturally.

383
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,020
Yes, Ms. Liu.

384
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,050
What?

385
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,040
- Ms. Liu.
- Ning Meng, you're here.

386
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,810
Have a seat.

387
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,620
What happened?

388
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,210
Something came up on my ex-husband's side.

389
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,070
He won't be able to transfer the money he promised to me on time.

390
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,280
Why?

391
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,120
His OEM factory used unapproved parts to reduce the cost of production.

392
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,740
The brand demanded a huge refund and compensation, too.

393
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,810
He has to use all of the funds to reproduce a new batch.

394
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,070
As for me, he won't be able to pay me now.

395
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,530
I've consulted a lawyer.

396
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:55,550
Even if we follow the legal procedures, we won't be able to get the funds for a while.

397
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,620
Then...

398
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,960
Ning Meng, it's my fault.

399
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,180
I breached our agreement.

400
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,480
I won't be able to honor our agreement.

401
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,940
I'll pay the penalty and compensate all of you

402
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,100
even if I have to sell everything I own.

403
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,930
Ms. Liu, let's not talk about terminating the agreement yet.

404
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,240
Let's solve the problem at hand.

405
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,370
I'll think of something about the money.

406
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,180
<i>[Eaglestone Capital]</i>

407
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,800
<i>Ning Meng, be honest with me.</i>

408
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,090
<i>Is Ms. Liu pessimistic about this project?</i>

409
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,360
<i>Is she planning not to fund it?</i>

410
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,060
Mr. Tang, you've misunderstood.

411
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,980
Why would Ms. Liu be pessimistic about this project?

412
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,880
The project has no problem.

413
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,920
Ms. Liu didn't expect that this would happen.

414
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,600
She's also anxious about it now.

415
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,960
I have no other meaning.

416
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm just worried that our investment will go down the drain.

417
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,790
Don't worry. I'm taking care of this problem.

418
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,270
Please believe in Eaglestone Capital.

419
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,160
You have my utmost trust.

420
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,040
But I have no confidence in Ms. Liu now.

421
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,080
Mr. Tang, I promised that I wouldn't let you down.

422
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,700
Please give me some time.

423
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,080
I'll find a way to help Ms. Liu to cover the capital gap.

424
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,450
But you have to be quick about it.

425
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,530
<i>The sooner, the better.</i>

426
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,600
Thank you for being understanding.

427
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,850
Mr. Liang.

428
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,130
Ms. Ning, can you tell me

429
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,310
if Lehui is in some kind of trouble?

430
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,910
It's only a matter of closing the capital gap.

431
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,300
The products have no issues at all.

432
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,660
If there are no issues with the products, ‏why is there such a big capital problem?

433
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,950
That's so unconvincing.

434
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,280
It's actually a mistake from Ms. Liu's ex-husband.

435
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,530
It's her ex-husband's fault.

436
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,550
But we, as LPs are paying the price.

437
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,670
How can I not be worried about this?

438
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,630
Ms. Ning, I'm under a lot of pressure too.

439
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,970
My... My shareholders are advising me to pull out of this project.

440
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,170
I can understand you're in a difficult position.

441
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,040
How about this, Mr. Liang?

442
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,430
Give me three days.

443
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:40,550
Just three days. I'll definitely find a way to cover this capital gap.

444
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,430
Ms. Shi.

445
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,480
Ning Meng, it's bound to affect the subsequent production

446
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,810
with such a huge capital gap. Right?

447
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,630
It'll indeed be very difficult if there are not enough funds.

448
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,500
But I'll think of something.

449
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,160
It's your project, so do all that you can.

450
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,840
But I have to tell you this in advance.

451
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,360
Our company is a little short of funds now.

452
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,470
If you want to cover the gap, you may have to find another investor.

453
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,100
If I'm not mistaken, there's still a sum of funds in the company.

454
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,810
I already have plans for those funds.

455
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,230
I understand.

456
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,450
I'll find ways to contact other LPs

457
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,410
so they can invest more in this project.

458
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,030
I may support you in making another effort.

459
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,200
But don't forget about the sunk cost.

460
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,340
It doesn't matter if you make it or not.

461
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,500
You must be firm and efficient in solving this issue quickly.

462
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,190
I understand.

463
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,770
I ordered your favorite food. I know you've been tired for the past two days.

464
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,480
Here. You'll only have the energy to work after you eat.

465
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,970
Senior, I'll be busy these few days.

466
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,870
I may not have the time to see you.

467
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm happy that you're telling me this.

468
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,260
Eat up.

469
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,150
Any progress with your project?

470
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,610
The LPs are very firm in their positions.

471
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,850
It'll be difficult to ask them to invest more.

472
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,590
I understand.

473
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,480
It's good enough that they're not holding you accountable when you're facing this problem.

474
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,660
LPs invest in businesses to make profits.

475
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,960
They're not obligated to help.

476
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,280
Stopping loss on time is something an investor must learn.

477
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,670
Don't tell me you still want to help Liu Huimin.

478
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,090
You can't be soft-hearted at this time.

479
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,120
This project is not worth investing in anymore.

480
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,130
I do think Lehui's project is good.

481
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,270
Ms. Liu is also a good person.

482
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,130
I don't want to give up because of this matter.

483
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,150
But it's not a small matter.

484
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,900
Is this her first time starting a business?

485
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,990
Why is there such a problem?

486
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,200
She and her husband started a company from scratch.

487
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,400
Because of her husband's pushy attitude,

488
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
she had no choice but to quit her post.

489
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,700
She has the capability.

490
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,500
The design concepts of Lehui Appliances

491
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,300
came from Ms. Liu's experience

492
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,000
when she led a plain daily life.

493
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
I think it's really valuable.

494
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,100
She's already divorced,

495
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,600
why does she still believe her ex-husband that much?

496
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,000
Don't you think she's too naive?

497
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,900
I think Ms. Liu and her ex-husband

498
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,000
can't be trusted.

499
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,500
Ms. Liu probably doesn't have this money at all

500
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,300
and she is colluding with her ex-husband

501
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,200
to trick the LPs into investing without investing anything themselves.

502
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
I've seen so many cases like this in the capital market.

503
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,400
Anything can happen in the face of great interests.

504
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,600
I admit something like this exists.

505
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,800
But that depends on the person.

506
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
I trust Ms. Liu.

507
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,500
It wasn't easy for her.

508
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,500
She mortgaged her house and her car.

509
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
She even borrowed money from her friends.

510
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,300
She completely threw herself in to do her best

511
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,600
to solve this problem and save this project.

512
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,800
I know you want to be responsible for Liu Huimin.

513
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,200
But you must be responsible for the other investors.

514
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Things like these will more or less affect the investors in some ways.

515
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,100
What you need to do is to minimize the losses.

516
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Let's put these aside.

517
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,200
Eating is more important.

518
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,400
Thanks. I can do it myself.

519
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
I'll find a way.

520
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,740
<i>[Lu XX: How are you doing?]</i>

521
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:46,600
<i>[To Lu Jiming. I'm okay, thanks.]</i>

522
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Hello, Mr. Tang.

523
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,800
I've received Kirin Furniture's latest financial statement.

524
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
Let's have a meal sometime

525
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,400
and discuss what project we can work on next.

526
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
Okay, when you're free.

527
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Oh, I heard there are some problems

528
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,400
with the household appliances company you've invested in. Right?

529
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm afraid it'll affect the production

530
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,800
with such a huge capital gap.

531
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Okay.

532
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,000
Let me know if you have any updates.

533
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,800
After all, Ning Meng was my employee.

534
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
Okay.

535
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
Thank you, Tang.

536
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,850
<i>[Loft 49]</i>

537
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,700
Excuse me, where's Ms. Liu?

538
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,100
There's a problem at the factory. They're withholding our stock.

539
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,500
After Ms. Liu found out, she rushed there with other co-workers.

540
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,200
You can't take them. You can't.

541
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,300
- Let's go.
- You can't take them.

542
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,600
- Stop it.
- Get out of the way.

543
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,700
Out of my way. Stop them.

544
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,600
What's going on here?

545
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,200
Listen. This stock belongs to our company.

546
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,800
You have no right to take them away.

547
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,600
Ms. Liu, I heard you have no funds coming in anymore.

548
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,400
I'll get the money.

549
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,200
I have already sold my house.

550
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,600
You will be paid the agreed amount.

551
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
How can I believe you?

552
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,400
How about this? Guys, move these away.

553
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,800
No, you can't!

554
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,700
Stop it! Don't touch them.

555
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,600
You can't take my stocks. Stop it.

556
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
- Get out of my way.
- Ms. Liu.

557
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

558
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,200
- Hey, stop it!
- Don't take them away.

559
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,400
Put them down.

560
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
Where did this little lady come from?

561
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Stop meddling in other people's business.

562
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,300
I thought the first payment ‏had been paid.

563
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,500
But you can't guarantee that she'll pay for the next phase.

564
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
Is Lehui going bankrupt now?

565
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,200
<i>That's right.</i>

566
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Lehui will definitely pay up and not a single penny less.

567
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,000
But the payment period is clearly written on the contract.

568
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,500
Aren't you taking advantage of other people's misfortune?

569
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,000
Miss, you can't put it that way.

570
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,200
If you want us to believe you, it's easy.

571
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,000
You have to show some sincerity.

572
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,600
You people aren't the employees here at all, right?

573
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Yes.

574
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,200
I want to see the owner of this factory.

575
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,800
I can understand how he feels.

576
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Bring him here and I'll explain it to him.

577
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,400
What to do?

578
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,800
The boss isn't here.

579
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,500
Now, I have the say here.

580
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,600
Today, I'll give you two choices.

581
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,000
First, pay now and I'll let you go.

582
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Second, we'll sell these things.

583
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Don't you need money?

584
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,400
When the time comes, I'll spare you some change.

585
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,000
- Am I right?
<i>- That's right.
- Yes.</i>

586
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
You're being unreasonable.

587
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,200
If you continue harassing us and making unreasonable demands, we'll take legal action.

588
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,000
You sure talk big for your age.

589
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You can try if you don't believe me. Instead of you extorting any money, I'm going to make you compensate with everything you have.

590
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Who do you think you are?

591
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
Move them!

592
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
- You can't take them!
- Get lost!
- Don't let them take it!

593
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Stop it! You can't do this.

594
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,300
Stop it now! Stop it!

595
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,700
You can't take it! Stop it!

596
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
- You...
- Get lost!

597
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,600
Get out of my way!

598
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Ning Meng, are you okay?

599
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,500
Boss, the police are coming.

600
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Over here!

601
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,800
Let's go.

602
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
Let's go to the hospital.

603
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,700
The cut isn't deep. You're pretty lucky.

604
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,600
If the cut was any deeper and injured the aorta,

605
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
your life would be in danger.

606
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,000
Thank you.

607
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,600
You look like you just had a fight.

608
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,300
Lad, don't be impulsive.

609
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,500
Doctor, I was helping others in trouble.

610
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Did the police catch those hooligans?

611
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,900
Ms. Liu just called me. She said they were arrested by the Public Security Bureau for questioning.

612
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,800
So it's true that you were helping out by beating the bad guys.

613
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Lad, not bad.

614
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,400
Why did you suddenly appear there?

615
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,600
I heard you guys were in trouble.

616
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Who told you?

617
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Tang Zhengwang told me when we were discussing some matters.

618
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,800
Thank you for your help today.

619
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,800
It's not a big deal.

620
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,700
You have to eat plain food for several days. Or else, it'll leave a scar.

621
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,900
Okay.

622
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,500
Thanks.

623
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,000
We can at least still be friends, right?

624
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,400
Just be friends. Is that okay?

625
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,500
Okay.

626
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,900
Friends.

627
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,300
Just like how you treat Zeng Yuhang and Xu Sitian.

628
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,600
Just be simple and don't say anything weird

629
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,400
or do anything that crosses the line as friends.

630
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,600
Sure, no problem.

631
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,600
Thank you for helping me out today, my friend.

632
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,800
Piece of cake, my friend.

633
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,600
Ning Meng.

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
♫ <i>No matter how reluctant you feel</i> ♫

644
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,500
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫

645
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,400
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

646
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,200
♫ <i>Watching the fallen leaves, listening to the wind</i> ♫

647
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:09,400
♫ <i>Saying that all colors have luster</i> ♫

648
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,000
♫ <i>Don't want to be bullied, to be brushed off</i> ♫

649
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,200
♫ <i>And to be treated like a fool</i> ♫

650
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,600
♫ <i>Breaking through the laws of the world</i> ♫

651
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,400
♫ <i>And reconnect with the sacred heart</i> ♫

652
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:48,000
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

653
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
♫ <i>Every little thing we gain in life</i> ♫

654
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,100
♫ <i>Comes with huge obstacles</i> ♫

655
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:03,400
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

656
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,300
♫ <i>There's no so-called happy ending</i> ♫

657
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,800
♫ <i>Just make your decision bravely</i> ♫
