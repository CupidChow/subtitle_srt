What illusions could I have had?

7
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,000
You made it sound as if I had fallen for you.

8
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,850
What a narcissist. Do you think I'll fall for you?

I was busy just now.

That's not what I meant.

17
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,900
The AR company sent me a new pair of glasses.

18
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,160
It's an improved version of their product. I want you to try it.

Join us. This car can fit all of us.

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,010
It's fine. I bought a railway ticket.

It's not easy getting a weekend ticket.

I'm actually an analyst.

You are quite different.

Usually, people tend to brag about themselves.

71
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,920
You, on the other hand, strip your own titles.

You can't fake your status.

73
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,840
Mr. Lin, why didn't I see your project during the competition?

74
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,600
My project didn't make it to the final.

75
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,200
What product was that?

76
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,470
Home fitness equipment named Mobi.

77
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,840
Let me tell you more about it.

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,320
Take a look at this and see if you have any comments.

79
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,880
It's my honor.

80
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,430
In fact, I worked as a programmer for a few years

81
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,650
after I graduated from university.

82
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,180
During that time, I had to work overtime almost every day.

83
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,140
After work, I always had a hotpot or barbecue dinner with beer.

84
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,550
I was young, and I thought I was strong enough to do whatever I wanted.

85
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,070
Later, I started seeing a lot of online news

86
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,820
talking about sudden death in young people.

87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,880
I got worried.

88
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,000
I went to the hospital immediately for a body check-up.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,540
Thanks to the body check-up,

90
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,480
I discovered a lot of red flags.

91
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,160
I like working out...

92
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,320
simply because I love my life.

93
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,520
As time went by, it had turned into a hobby.

94
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,900
Later, I turned it into a business.

95
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,790
I hope to combine my profession

96
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,170
<i>[Smart Treadmill]</i>

97

- Yes.

98
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,170
As long as your products are unique enough,

99
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,250
you'll be able to build a big customer base.

100
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,580
Can you give me a chance to study your product?

101
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,310
Of course!

102
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,500
Just let me know when,

103
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,820
and you can drop by my office whenever you want to. How about that?

104
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,060
Sounds great. Thanks, Mr. Lin.

105
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,750

<i>Can I stay at your place for a few days?</i>

114

Why do you ask? Of course, you can.

115

Where are you going to stay otherwise?

116
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,670
<i>Ning Meng, can you take care of Qiqi on my behalf just for a few days?</i>

117
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,240
<i>I'll buy you a meal later.</i>

118
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,550
<i>Don't let her eat anything cooling.</i>

119
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,590
<i>She has a bad stomach.</i>

120
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,420
<i>Besides, don't stay up too late.</i>

121
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,280
<i>She's been going to bed late these days.</i>

122

<i>It's not good for your health.</i>

<i>Sure. You're so naggy.</i>

124
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,960
<i>Just let me enjoy my time with Mengmeng.</i>

125
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,130
<i>Sure. You go ahead.</i>

126
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,900
Let me know your arrival time and the flight number.

127
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,590
I'll pick you up at the airport.

128
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,500
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,460
<i>Mengmeng, did anything happen after the last kiss?</i>

130
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,280
What kiss?

131
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,830
I told you it wasn't me...

132
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,700
Forget it. Don't mention this again.

133
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,960
<i>What's wrong?</i>

134
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,880
<i>What happened?</i>

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Nothing happened. What could have happened?

136
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,250
Nothing could've happened. Just stay out of others' business.

137
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,060
Why are you always sticking your nose into others' business?

138
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,110
It's been resolved. My friend has settled it.

139
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,440
<i>No, but you kissed him.</i>

140
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
<i>Something must have happened.</i>

141
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,710
<i>Mengmeng, tell you what.</i>

142
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,100
<i>You have to take your feelings seriously.</i>

143

Anything else you want to say?

144
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,940
Otherwise, I'll get going. Look, I still have work to do.

145
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,690
<i>Fine. Bye.</i>

146

Watch your step.

148
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,460
Mr. Lin, I like how lively the atmosphere in the office is.

149
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,930
Of course. We are a company that produces fitness equipment.

150
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,660
Many of our employees are fitness junkies.

151
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,980
Your products look pretty good.

152
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,380
You're right about that.

153
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,600
Not only do they look good, but they are also more than just a gimmick.

154
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,640
Let me demonstrate it to you.

155
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,110
- Tmall Genie.
<i>- How can I help you?</i>

156
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,160
Turn on the treadmill.

157
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,650
It takes a longer time to open.

158
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,580
This is how we designed it to be

159
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,180
because we are afraid of it hitting the kids at home.

160
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,160
Tmall Genie. Start the treadmill.

161
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,690
Besides the hardware, we've also developed software

162
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,740
that is able to create personalized workout plans for our clients.

163
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,710
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

164
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,630
Mr. Lin, most consumers aren't very familiar with a rowing machine like this.

165
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,980
I suppose there is a tutorial.

166
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,040
Yes. You can find the tutorials in the application.

167
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,010
Next, we're hoping to incorporate biomechanics into sports

168
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,890
so that our clients can use our products in a better and safer environment.

169
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,940
That's great.

170
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,790
Do you want to give it a try?

171
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,110
Sure.

172
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,440
I think Mobi has a very good development philosophy.

173
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,960
They make sure the products are space-efficient and presentable,

174
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,390
and they put in even more effort in making sure that the products are safe and professional.

175
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,280
This gives the company a competitive differentiation among its peers.

176
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,910
That's good.

177
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,590
You learned quite a lot from NIEC.

178
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,280
If you think it's worth investing, do the market research.

179
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,050
Find out what the market, the competitors, and the benchmarking company are like.

180
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,600
Then, submit a report to me.

181
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,030
Sure.

182
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,740
I heard that Mr. Lu was at NIEC, too.

183
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,600
Yes.

184
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,450
That's great. You can learn a lot from Mr. Lu.

185
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,130
Yes, Ms. Shi.

186
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,340
I'll get back to work.

187
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,220
<i>[Eaglestone]</i>

188
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,550
Madam Liu.

189
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,850
<i>Ning,</i>

190
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,410
are you busy?

191
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,000
Is it convenient for you to talk now?

192
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
Sure. Go ahead.

193
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,610
<i>Here is the thing.</i>

194
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,040
Mingming's birthday is in a few days, right?

195
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,310
It's only once a year. It's an important date.

196
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,850
I'm wondering if our family can have a meal together.

197
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>What do you think?</i>

198
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,650
Sounds good.

199
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,080
<i>I sent Mingming a text,</i>

200
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,300
but he hasn't replied to the text yet. Has he been busy lately?

201
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,590
Can you relay the message to him?

202
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,870
Madam Liu, sorry. I forgot to tell you

203
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,580
that I've left Joint Capital.

204
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,490
So I have no idea about Mr. Lu's schedule.

205
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,300
What's wrong? Have you two been fighting lately?

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,300
No. It's just a normal career change.

207
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,050
<i>That's good to hear.</i>

208
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:19,900
<i>I was hoping that you could tell him to come home for dinner</i>

209
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,800
<i>when he isn't occupied with work.</i>

210
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,770
You are the only person he listens to.

211
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,010
This is Mr. Lu's personal matter.

212
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,880
I think I'm in no place to interfere.

213
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,590
Sorry. I know I'm putting you in a difficult position.

214
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,480
<i>I guess you haven't heard about this yet.</i>

215
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
Things haven't been going well between him and his father.

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,470
It's been a while since they last spoke on the phone.

217
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,930
I'm hoping

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that this birthday meal can patch up the differences between this father-and-son duo.

219
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,990
How about this, Madam Liu?

220
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,230
I can give him a call.

221
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,230
However, I can't guarantee that Mr. Lu will agree to show up.

222
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,520
<i>Thank you so much, Ning.</i>

223
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,080
No problem.

224
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,940
Bye.

225
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,870
<i>Mr. Lu.</i>

226
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,660
Anything?

227
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,590
Your birthday is in two days, right?

228
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,470
<i>What's the plan for your birthday?</i>

229
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,940
Thanks for the reminder because I had already forgotten about it.

230
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,570
Yang Xiaoyang, what's my schedule on the 13th?

231
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,440
The 13th?

232
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
You have an interview with a finance magazine in the afternoon.

233
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
- In the evening...
- I'm free that day.

234
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,250
What's your plan?

235
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,110
<i>That's good.</i>

236
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,890
What about this? Madam Liu gave me a call.

237
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,180
She was hoping that you could go home for dinner that day.

238
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm not available.

239
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,660
I thought you said you were free that day.

240
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,060
Ning Meng, I thought you'd come to your senses.

241
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,510
But it turns out you're siding with my dad.

242
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,410
Did he pay you for this?

243
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:21,510
I'm not getting paid.

244
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,550
I simply think that Madam Liu is in a very difficult position.

245
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,230
My presence will only make things worse.

246
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,610
Wouldn't it be more ugly if there was a fight at the dinner table?

247
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,900
You know very well how stubborn that old man is.

248
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,640
Mr. Lu, didn't we agree on this?

249
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,090
You said you would spend more time with your dad when you're free.

250
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,280
When did I agree on that?

251
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,300
When we were on the rooftop, you...

252
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,940
Fine.

253
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,400
I can go home, but only on one condition.

254
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,320
You have to come with me.

255
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,590
Why?

256
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,430
Mr. Zeng can go with you.

257
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,010
Zeng Yuhang is on a business trip and he'll be away for two days.

258
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,140
Besides, you did this to yourself.

259
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,780
Of course, you should come with me.

260
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,030
<i>If you don't want to come along,</i>

261
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,620
then forget it.

262
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,970
Fine. I'll be there.

263
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,930
- Mingming. Ning.
- Madam Liu.

264
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,850
Come on in.

265
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,830
Madam Liu. Mr. Lu.

266
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,810
Ning, you're here.

267
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,860
Mr. Lu.

268
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,350
Ning, you're kind enough to pay us a visit.

269
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,200
There's no need to bring us gifts.

270
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,060
That's too sweet of you.

271
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,310
Mr. Lu bought these for you.

272
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,480
Look at how much your son cares for you. It's as if it was your birthday.

273
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,140
Dad, going to go fishing?

274
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,230
Mr. Lu, do you like the fishing reel I brought you?

275
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,460
Don't bring up the fishing reel.

276
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,240
It's perfect.

277
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,450
Because of it, I have to go fishing once every few days.

278
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,780
I can't stand not fishing anymore.

279
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,610
Look at what you did.

280
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,740
You bought something Mr. Lu really likes.

281
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,600
It's a shame that the fish in the pond have gotten smarter these days.

282
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,320
They stopped taking the baits.

283
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,630
Mingming, why don't you go fishing with your dad?

284
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,100
Why should I?

285
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,410
It's been a long time since the two of you last had a good talk.

286
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,140
We don't talk when we fish.

287
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,620
That will scare the fish away.

288
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,210
Why can't you talk when you fish?

289
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,920
Mr. Lu, aren't you going fishing with your client next week?

290
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,410
Your dad can share a few fishing tips with you.

291
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,090
I'll pass.

292
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,050
Up to you.

293
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll get going.

294
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,060
- Bring home a big fish.
- Sure.

295
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,450
It's windy outside.

296
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,340
Bring this jacket to your dad. Come on.

297
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,280
Hurry up.

298
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,970
Go.

299
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,530
Mr. Lu, you can go fishing.

300
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,620
I'll help Madam Liu with the cooking.

301
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,890
Pass me the bait.

302
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,300
Don't be shy. Just put it on if you're feeling cold.

303
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,170
Don't you want to put this on?

304
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,070
No. I'm not like you.

305
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,500
You're young, but you're weak.

306
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,500
Pass me the wheat.

307
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,550
Which one is the wheat?

308
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,550
The one in the black bottle.

309
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,470
You really know nothing.

310
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,620
Do you really want to learn how to fish?

311
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,790
Only if you're willing to teach me.

312
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,620
You look pretty keen.

313
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,660
<i>[Is the meal ready yet? Hurry up!]</i>

314
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,780
You're still young, but you're always staring at your phone.

315
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,310
Won't it hurt your neck?

316
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,740
Look who's talking.

317
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,280
Aren't you the same?

318
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,100
You're staring at the pond all day.

319
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,160
Your age is catching up to you.

320
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,390
Prolonged sitting will only hurt your back.

321
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,430
You're right.

322
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,600
- I heard from Madam Liu...
- I heard from Madam Liu...

323
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,600
You go first.

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,100
I heard from Madam Liu that you've invested in a project about an environmental-friendly material.

325
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,300
It might be able to replace conventional plastic.

326
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,800
It's a new eco-friendly thermoplastic material.

327
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,700
Theoretically speaking,

328
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,800
if the research turns out successful,

329
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,700
every ton of material produced

330
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,800
can reduce the carbon emissions of 540 trees.

331
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,200
This is a significant step in solving global climate change.

332
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Do you get it?

333
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I've also heard that Lu Guoyu, the major shareholder of your company,

334
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,600
voted against this decision during the shareholders' meeting.

335
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
Dad, I'm not trying to change your mind.

336
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
He's been working for you since you founded the company.

337
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Yet, you're always working on long-running projects

338
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,500
that seem to bring the company no return.

339
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,800
Of course, they'd get nervous about it.

340
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,800
What's meant to be will always find a way.

341
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
More haste, less speed.

342
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,200
You're not here to fish.

343
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You won't understand these sayings.

344
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I do know nothing about fishing,

345
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,900
but I know about investment.

346
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,100
It's not right to focus on your own wishes and disregard the facts.

347
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,200
How many patents have 3M licensed?

348
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,600
Do they always materialize the patent ideas right away?

349
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,000
Let's talk about their waterproof membrane.

350
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,800
They only found its market demand on the glasses of underground miners many years later.

351
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,200
They earned more than ten million U.S. dollars in a year after they started production.

352
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,500
Did all the time they spent before this go down the drain?

353
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,600
Dad, you've repeated this story way too many times.

354
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm tired of listening to it.

355
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,800
That means you haven't understood the moral of the story.

356
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Are you here to upset me?

357
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,100
Fine. If you manage to turn Qinhe into an old and prestigious company,

358
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,000
you'll earn my respect. How about that?

359
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
Sure.

360
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,400
You mentioned Madam Liu...

361
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,900
What?

362
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,300
You were saying something about Madam Liu.

363
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,500
Madam Liu told me

364
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,600
that Ning is no longer your secretary.

365
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,900
Yes.

366
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Why are you still hanging out with her now that she has resigned?

367
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,500
What's your relationship with her?

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
We still work with each other even after her resignation.

369
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Besides, Madam Liu was the one who invited her over, not me.

370
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,200
Why do you get so annoyed when I'm only asking you a question?

371
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,000
If you can find yourself a girlfriend and settle down with her, would I have to worry so much?

372
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,000
What are you doing?

373
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
The fish has taken the bait. You...

374
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Why did you ruin my chance?

375
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,600
Old Lu, how did the fishing go?

376
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
How many did you catch?

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
The fish got scared away. There's nothing for me to catch.

378
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
All right. Wash your hands, it's mealtime.

379
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Mingming, have you been very busy at work?

380
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
It's manageable.

381
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,200
Remember to take care of yourself no matter how busy you are.

382
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
You've lost weight.

383
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,200
Remember to eat on time.

384
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Ning, home-cooked food is the best. Right?

385
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
Yes, it's the best.

386
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,100
Mingming, if you run into any problems at work,

387
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
you can always ask your dad for his advice.

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,800
Your dad cares about you a lot.

389
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Why are you talking so much?

390
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,800
Don't you know that you shouldn't talk during mealtimes?

391
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,200
Fine.

392
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,000
Stop drinking. Don't get drunk.

393
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,800
I know what I'm doing.

394
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,300
Your dad did a body checkup last month,

395
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,700
and it showed that he had relatively high blood pressure.

396
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,300
The doctor told him to reduce his alcohol intake.

397
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,600
We're having dinner now.

398
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,900
Why did you have to bring that up?

399
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,600
Are you trying to upset me, too?

400
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,200
Are we going to enjoy the meal?

401
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Dad, you should take care of your own health.

402
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,400
Why are you doing this to yourself?

403
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Madam Liu is right.

404
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,800
You should cut down your alcohol intake for your own sake.

405
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,600
I know what to do about my own health.

406
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,800
Fine. It's my fault.

407
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
I shouldn't have brought up your hypertension.

408
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,700
It's Mingming's birthday.

409
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,500
You can drink if you want to.

410
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,200
Madam Liu, of course, you have to bring it up.

411
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
He can't keep hiding his illness from us.

412
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
What if his health got worse...

413
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,100
What if?

414
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,600
Can't you wish the best for me?

415
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,800
Do you want to see me sick?

416
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,100
Dad, you got me wrong. That's not what I meant.

417
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,400
It's normal to fall sick

418
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,800
when one grows old.

419
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,800
You can't tell us only the good news and not the bad news.

420
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,200
Madam Liu is doing that for your sake.

421
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
She didn't mean...

422
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,600
You don't have to defend her.

423
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,800
Enough. Don't get mad.

424
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
What if your blood pressure gets higher?

425
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,200
I only have high blood pressure because of this kid.

426
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,300
Dad, what did I do that upset you again?

427
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,800
We're just worried about you.

428
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,300
Otherwise, we wouldn't have spent so much time trying to convince you.

429
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,400
Madam Liu was just being concerned,

430
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
and you got annoyed at what she said.

431
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
How's Madam Liu supposed to feel?

432
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,400
I don't care how she feels.

433
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Do you think you can act however you wish just because it's your birthday?

434
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Just mind your own business.

435
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Don't meddle in adults' affairs.

436
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,900
I never wanted to poke my nose into your business,

437
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
but this was how you treated my mom.

438
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,000
Otherwise, my mom wouldn't have left us.

439
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,300
Why did you bring up your mom?

440
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,100
You can't win the argument just by raising your voice.

441
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,200
You only had a little alcohol and you went all crazy.

442
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,600
I think you're being unreasonable.

443
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm being unreasonable?

444
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,300
I raised you up, sent you to school, paid your tuition fees, and put food on the table.

445
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,300
What else have I not done for you?

446
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,800
What have you done for me?

447
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,300
What have you done for me other than giving me some money?

448
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,200
Lu Jiming, you think you're all grown up now,

449
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,000
so you are trying to defy me, huh?

450
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If you hate coming home, then don't come home ever again.

451
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Do you think I like coming home?

452
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,000
I guess you wouldn't even remember it was my birthday if Madam Liu hadn't mentioned it.

453
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,400
You care for no one, except for yourself.

454
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,600
Madam Liu has done so much for you.

455
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
Even I feel so sorry for her.

456
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,800
Mr. Lu, don't get mad.

457
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
We'll get going first.

458
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,300
Mr. Lu, I think you did a great job today.

459
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You don't have to comfort me. I'm used to this.

460
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,100
I'm not trying to comfort you. I mean it.

461
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,000
I can tell that you've tried your best today.

462
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,700
Take it easy.

463
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,800
Okay.

464
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,600
We've arrived.

465
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,600
You didn't eat much today.

466
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,200
Don't worry. Just go home.

467
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,800
I'll grab some food on my way home.

468
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,700
Do you want to come over?

469
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,900
Let's go.

470
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,080
Here.

471
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,000
You didn't have cake, so I made you some longevity noodles.

472
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,310
You can add whatever seasonings you like.

473
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,910
What's wrong? Do you not like it?

474
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,570
Let me answer the video call from my mom.

475
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,370
Hi.

476
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,650
<i>- Mengmeng.
- Mengmeng.</i>

477
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,420
<i>Are you coming home on Labor Day?</i>

478
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,110
I don't think so.

479
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,300
I've been busy with work lately.

480
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,690
<i>I thought you would have a better lifestyle after you got yourself a new job.</i>

481
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,710
<i>Can't you apply for a day off?</i>

482
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:16,880
<i>It seems like your current boss is not any better than your previous boss.</i>

483
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,850
<i>Mengmeng, do you have guests?</i>

484
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,340
<i>[Zeng Yuhang]</i>

485
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,720
My friend is here.

486
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,670
<i>Your boyfriend?</i>

487
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,280
My colleague.

488
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,260
<i>A male colleague?</i>

489
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,890
You...

490
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,130
<i>I'm your mom. You can share everything with me.</i>

491
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,530
<i>A male colleague, right?</i>

492
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,210
<i>Not a committed relationship yet, right?</i>

493
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,350
<i>Look, I know what's going on.</i>

494
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,720
This is a video call.

495
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,400
- He can still hear you even if you whisper, so can you stop?
<i>- Fine.</i>

496
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,870
<i>Let me talk. You won't know what to say.</i>

497
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,840
<i>- Enough.
- Mengmeng, you know what. You...</i>

498
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,180
<i>Mengmeng.</i>

499
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,900
<i>Fine.</i>

500
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,370
<i>We won't disturb you any further.</i>

501
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,330
<i>Enjoy your meal with your male colleague.</i>

502
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,450
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

503
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,840
<i>[Zeng Yuhang: Why did you hang up on me! I was about to wish you a happy birthday!]</i>

504
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,330
Not any better than your previous boss?

505
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,890
It seems like you often spoke poorly of me in front of your parents.

506
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,400
No.

507
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,030
At least, not always.

508
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,580
Get me another bowl of noodles.

509
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,090
Sure.

510
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:16,470
You have a harmonious family.

511
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,890
Yes.

512
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,240
My parents are hilarious.

513
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,340
Don't feel sorry for me.

514
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,110
I don't need it.

515
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,660
Pass me the noodles.

516
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,230
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.

517
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,960
We all have different issues.

518
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,720
Look at how good you turned out to be.

519
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,700
Can you really say that it has nothing to do with your father?

520
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,130
What does it have anything to do with him?

521
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,000
An apple never falls far from the tree.

522
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,440
You're doing well, so that means

523
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,460
you have inherited the good traits from him.

524
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,650
Lowly parents can give birth to an exceptional child, too.

525
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm the child.

526
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,600
That doesn't make sense.

527
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,830
You're like two peas in a pod.

528
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,480
You have the exact same temperament.

529
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,940
Are you trying to ruin my appetite?

530
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,290
No, I'll stop talking. Eat up.

531
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,010
Do you have more? Can I have another bowl?

532
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,730
Is my cooking that good?

533
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,970
It's not good.

534
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,520
I've had enough of expensive food.

535
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,470
Sometimes, I can make do with some plain food.

536
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,490
You're making do with it, but you're asking for a third bowl.

537
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,230
If you really like it, will you swallow the entire pot?

538
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,580
You say one thing and mean another.

539
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Eat some vegetables, too.

540
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,760
Thanks.

541
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,260
Happy birthday.

542
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,180
What's wrong? Is there something on my face?

543
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,880
There's a spring onion between your teeth.

544
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,250
I was just kidding. Silly one.

545
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,880
Just eat your noodles.

546
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,480

<i>Can you pick me up if you're free?</i>

552
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,360
Mr. Lu, where are we going?

553
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,130
Pass me the key.

554
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,510
I'm going out. You can go home first.

555
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,340
Bye, Mr. Lu.

556
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,230
Oh, no. Mr. Lu must have found out about us.

557
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,600
He is going to dump me.

558
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,330
It can't be. Drink this.

559
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,310
Drink it.

560
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,620
I've just arrived at the airport.

561
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,930
I'll wait for you at the exit.

562

You'll see me right at the exit.

563
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,270
Mengmeng, I missed you so much.

564
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,670
I'm so tired. Look at my thick thighs.

565
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,700
Your thighs are nothing compared to mine.

566
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,390
Your job did this to you.

567
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,330
I'll make sure to make you pretty.

568
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,050
Just don't create a mess for me.

569

Let's go get a cab.

570

Let's go.

571
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,500
The traffic was congested. I was afraid that I would miss your flight time.

572
