Please calm down, everyone.

6
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,190
Mr. Lu has a family emergency.

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,230
Please be understanding.

8
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,130
We know what Mr. Lu is going through.

9
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,810
My company is also my life.

10
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,230
My company is going under.

11
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,440
Will anyone understand me?

12
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,080
Yes, who's going to pity us?

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,120
I understand.

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,730
I've informed Mr. Lu about this.

It will be resolved soon, okay?

16

We've heard about Lu Tianxing.

17
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,460
What worries me is that the investment money

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,090
will be used on something else.

19
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,800
That's right. You can rest assured of that.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,900
Mr. Lu is not that kind of person.

21
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,190
He never mixes professional and personal matters.

22
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,530
Then, why is he avoiding us?

23
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,170
Yes, where is he?

24
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,880
He isn't avoiding you.

25
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
He's up to his neck in problems.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,460
There's only so much he can handle.

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,930
Sirs, please calm down. Have some tea.

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,530
I will settle the matters one by one.

29

Please rest assured.

30
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,040
Back then, so many people were scrambling to invest in my company.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,550
I trusted Lu Jiming and so I chose to work with him.

32

Several company bosses and employers came to get answers from Mr. Lu.

37

Mr. Lu hasn't come to the office in days.

We have no idea what the situation is.

39

Are we really in trouble?

40
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,590
Zhou from the Risk Control Department has already resigned.

41
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,650
Those in risk management have keen senses.

42
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,810
He must have seen signs of trouble.

43
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,160
Mr. Liu, I've filled in the resignation form.

44

Don't say that.

49
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,030
Mr. Lu isn't irresponsible like that.

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,960
That's the most disgusting way.

168
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
Not only with You Qi, but you also did the same with Qinhe.

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,760
You betrayed our trust. You lied to us.

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,720
Ning Meng, mind your words.

171
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,560
I can't deny I was wrong in my relationship with You Qi.

172
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,330
But regarding Qinhe, you can't blame it on me.

173
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,900
Still putting on a show, aren't you?

174
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,100
Before Mr. Lu came to you, you already had an agreement with Shuangxun.

175
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,870
Am I wrong?

176
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,350
You kept saying it was undergoing the process, putting off signing the contract.

177
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,000
It was to help Shuangxun keep Mr. Lu occupied, no?

178
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,900
I don't know what you're saying.

179
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,200
Does Jiangnanchun Restaurant ring a bell?

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,500
You'd started to collude with each other since that time.

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
I had warned you not to get involved

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,700
with a conniving guy like Qiu Junlin.

183
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,600
But I never would've thought that

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,000
you'd be the most conniving one of all.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
I reckon you made good money from Qinhe.

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,700
But money made with questionable means

187
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
will have to be returned sooner or later

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,400
even if you pocket it now.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
These illegal and unscrupulous things you did

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,500
will surely come back to bite you one day.

191
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,100
Ning Meng.

192
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,400
Are you threatening me?

193
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Do you have proof?

194
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Before you threaten me,

195
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
you should watch your own back.

196
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
You want to find dirt on me?

197
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,700
You're too naive.

198
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,000
Just you wait.

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
Qiqi.

200
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,400
Look. I brought you food.

201
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,500
Eat up.

202
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm not hungry.

203
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
I haven't eaten myself.

204
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll eat with you.

205
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,200
Look. This is your favorite grilled duck.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,300
It smells great.

207
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
Let me make a wrap for you.

208
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,400
How about going on a trip?

209
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,300
A local trip? Or overseas?

210
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's take a vacation.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I don't want to go anywhere.

212
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,900
Here you go.

213
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,400
You eat.

214
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
You're going to fall sick like this.

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,600
Talk to me.

216
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,900
You might feel better once you let it all out.

217
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,000
Mengmeng, I'm useless, aren't I?

218
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,100
I remember you telling me before.

219
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,700
To be more independent.

220
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,800
To have personal goals.

221
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,500
But I thought I had goals.

222
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,100
My goal was Old He.

223
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,600
As long as I had him, I didn't need anything else.

224
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,800
I didn't have to think about other matters.

225
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
I was looking forward to being Mrs. He.

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,300
But now I feel like...

227
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,600
I'm drifting in the vast ocean.

228
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,200
The lighthouse in front of me is suddenly gone.

229
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm left all by myself.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,600
I don't know where I'll end up.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Where am I in the picture?

232
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
You still have me.

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,600
I will be with you forever.

234
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
Also, in this world,

235
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,100
there are other things aside from the lighthouse.

236
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
If you look up,

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
the stars in the sky are there to direct you.

238
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
You will surely find the path meant for you.

239
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Will I really be able to?

240
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,400
Of course.

241
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
You're still young.

242
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,300
This is your chance to start over.

243
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,800
Who the heck is he?

244
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Even without He Yueluan,

245
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,500
you'll be able to live well.

246
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Perhaps even better.

247
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
What's the matter?

248
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,000
This grilled duck is too good.

249
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,600
Wrap me another one.

250
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,700
Okay.

251
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,600
Don't choke. Eat slowly.

252
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Let me make another wrap.

253
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,100
Don't choke.

254
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Is You Qi feeling better?

255
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
She's better. She has started eating normally.

256
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,400
But to get over it will take some time.

257
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Many things have happened lately.

258
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,100
You must be exhausted.

259
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,100
Why don't we go to a hot spring resort this weekend to relax a little?

260
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,700
<i>[Witness: Unprepared for Shuangxun's surprise attack, Qinhe's defeat was inevitable]</i>

261
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,100
If you're worried about You Qi,

262
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
we can take her along.

263
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Ning Meng.

264
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,600
What did you say?

265
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
What's on your mind?

266
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Senior, I don't know much about the secondary market.

267
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,900
I'd like to know. If I wish to manipulate stock prices,

268
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,000
what are the specific steps?

269
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,200
Why are you asking that?

270
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Manipulating stock prices is considered human manipulation. It's against the law.

271
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I looked into Shuangxun's stock fund management plan.

272
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
When Qinhe's stocks fell,

273
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,700
it led to the net worth of their plan dropping below 0.8.

274
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,400
Shuangxun will be forced to close.

275
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
It's a grave loss.

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,800
So my guess is that they'd contacted Caihuang Capital.

277
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,200
Ning Meng, you shouldn't meddle in this matter.

278
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
If He Yueluan and Shuangxun did something illegal,

279
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,900
the CSRC and Economic Crime Investigation will deal with it.

280
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,200
But... I was the one who introduced He Yueluan to Mr. Lu.

281
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,600
I am responsible for what happened.

282
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
We can't read the future.

283
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,800
You couldn't have known that He Yueluan was up to no good.

284
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Besides, Qinhe's equity is spread out.

285
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
Since Lu Jiming wants to help his dad,

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,700
Renning Insurance had to be his first target.

287
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,100
You just happened to know He Yueluan.

288
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,400
Even if not through you,

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,000
Lu Jiming could've contacted He Yueluan using other means.

290
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It is his only choice.

291
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

292
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Why must you feel guilty towards Lu Jiming?

293
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I don't mean anything else.

294
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,200
Please don't talk about him again.

295
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,800
And I won't get so sensitive. All right?

296
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,700
Madam Liu. I'll watch him.

297
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,500
You go eat.

298
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,400
Mingming, is everything okay with the company?

299
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,300
Don't worry. It's being resolved.

300
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
What...

301
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,500
Take it.

302
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
I don't need the money anyway.

303
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,600
Take it. It should be of some use.

304
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Madam Liu, what are you doing?

305
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,300
I can handle the problem on my own.

306
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,000
We are a family.

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Just take it.

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I know the company is in a pinch.

309
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Even so, I can't accept your money.

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,900
Don't worry. I have a plan.

311
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
What plan?

312
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,000
You're just like your dad.

313
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You came from the same mold. Just as stubborn.

314
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,400
That stubborn old man.

315
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,700
Sometimes, he really annoys me.

316
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,400
One time, we went on an outing.

317
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
It was cold outside.

318
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,800
He kept scolding me.

319
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,700
"Do you think you're a teenager?

320
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,600
Who asked you to dress so thinly?"

321
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,800
I got really mad at him

322
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
and ignored him for a few days.

323
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,500
Later, while taking my clothes,

324
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,000
I found two new cardigans in my wardrobe.

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I asked him,

326
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
"Lu, how come there are two new cardigans?

327
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Did you buy them for me?"

328
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
He wouldn't admit it.

329
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
I don't know where he got them.

330
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,200
They were ghastly.

331
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
My dad sure cares about you.

332
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you remember one time on your birthday?

333
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,900
He got angry with me at the dinner table.

334
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
You spoke up for me.

335
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
It was only right.

336
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,200
I was pretty touched then.

337
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,100
Since then, your dad's attitude towards me changed somewhat.

338
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,600
He's not as bad-tempered as before.

339
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,700
Sometimes, he'd even show care for me.

340
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,800
"Eat this. Eat that."

341
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,300
It's all good.

342
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,800
Actually, your dad just has a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

343
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,600
He was always so happy when you went home to eat.

344
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,700
- Was he?
- Of course.

345
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,100
One time, we were eating by ourselves at home.

346
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,200
He had a bit more to drink.

347
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,000
I only found out later it was because you received

348
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
the "Best Investor" award.

349
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,200
He was holding your picture.

350
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,100
Looking so proud.

351
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,100
I wanted to call you back then

352
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,700
and ask you to come back and eat with us.

353
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,000
But he stopped me.

354
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,500
He told me not to call you and said, "He's busy working.

355
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm enjoying my drinks.

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
If I praised him, he'd let it get to his head."

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He also said, "The two of us can drink any time we want.

358
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
There's plenty of time."

359
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,000
The stubborn old man.

360
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,500
What do I do with him?

361
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,600
All right.

362
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
You stay with your dad.

363
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,300
I'll get some fresh air.

364
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>What are you doing? The fish took the bait.</i>

365
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,640
<i>You... You made me miss the catch!</i>

366
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,400
Dad.

367
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,000
You haven't taught me how to fish.

368
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,920
This time, I'll pay attention.

369
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,200
When I learn the way,

370
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,590
I won't scare the fish away.

371
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Mr. Lu, I'll take the car for a wash.

372
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,180
Tell me when you need the car.

373
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,110
Later, come up to the office when we reach.

374
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,310
Okay.

375
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,980
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

376
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,230
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

377
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,560
Xiaoyang,

378
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,780
ask everyone to gather in the meeting room.

379
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,800
I have something to say.

380
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,090
<i>[Meeting Room]</i>

381
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,660
Many things have happened with the company lately.

382
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm sure everyone has heard about it.

383
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,090
For the past weeks,

384
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,950
I have neglected company affairs

385
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,560
because I was busy dealing with family matters.

386
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,670
My dereliction of duty caused you guys to suffer. I'm sorry.

387
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,000
Don't say that, Mr. Lu.

388
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,200
We all understand.

389
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,060
That's right, Mr. Lu.

390
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,220
We understand your predicament. It's all right.

391
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,900
We will speak to our LPs and investees to get their understanding.

392
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,820
We will do it as many times as needed.

393
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,570
I'm sure we'll get back on our feet.

394
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:11,840
By the way, I've compiled all the projects from last season.

395
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,510
There are a few promising ones. Let's go through them again.

396
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,730
Whichever one we choose, I'll get in touch immediately.

397
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,230
I will prepare the promotional material.

398
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,230
I'll conduct the evaluation. We can go any time.

399
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,880
- I'll take care of the finance.
- I'll take care of the data analysis.

400
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,470
I... I can drive whoever needs a ride.

401
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,970
I will look for information and make notes. I'll keep a record.

402
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,060
Mr. Lu, I can fill in whatever is needed.

403
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,280
I'll gather everybody.

404
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,460
I'm really grateful to you all.

405
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,190
Thank you.

406
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,100
Today, I called everyone here

407
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,210
because I have something to announce.

408
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,450
Joint Capital will be dissolved.

409
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,230
I gave it a lot of thought.

410
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:07,780
With my current situation and my financial status,

411
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,120
I am unable to continue managing the company.

412
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:18,620
This is the best decision for the company, projects, and employees.

413
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,000
Every one of you is skilled and talented.

414
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,590
I'm thankful that you've stayed until now.

415
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:40,330
Ren, I've handed over the ongoing projects to other coordinators.

416
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,100
They're reliable companies.

417
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,730
I've spoken to them.

418
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,800
You guys will move on to the respective companies.

419
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,660
Your salary won't be any lower than now.

420
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,610
Mr. Lu, this is a shame.

421
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,200
The projects are about to make a profit.

422
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,680
Besides, you hand-picked these projects yourself.

423
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,160
Every one of them is good.

424
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,010
Thus, make sure you guys follow through to your best ability.

425
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,210
Finish what you've started.

426
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,900
Liu.

427
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,900
Thank you for your service.

428
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,070
I know I have a bad temper.

429
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,710
It was normal for employees to suddenly quit.

430
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,560
It must have been tough for the HR Department.

431
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,830
Mr. Lu, you are a good boss.

432
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,640
I sincerely wish I could stay longer at this company.

433
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,960
You have a family to look after.

434
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,620
Don't be rash.

435
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,770
Mr. Xu Senior has been wanting to get you to join him, right?

436
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,680
Just give the nod and you'll immediately get a raise.

437
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,350
Think about it.

438
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,170
The rest of you. I've found several companies.

439
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,180
I also wrote recommendation letters.

440
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,060
If you have better options,

441
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,520
I am willing to put in the word with the seasoned headhunters.

442

444
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,240
You two can go with Mr. Liu.

445
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,680
Mr. Lu, I don't want to leave.

446
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,180
I want to stay and be your secretary.

447
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,630
I no longer make mistakes making coffee.

448
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,200
Is that the only accomplishment?

449
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,550
You should be happy.

450
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,970
After this, I doubt you'd meet another boss with a worse temper than me.

451
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,320
But I've gotten used to your scolding.

452
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,580
If I get a good-tempered boss,

453
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,330
I'll feel out of place.

454
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,780
Stop crying.

455
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,210
Swallow it.

456
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,970
Mr. Lu, I'm not going anywhere.

457
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,520
I'm going to be your driver.

458
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,470
I've sold the car.

459
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,580
Someone will be taking it.

460
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,090
No car, no problem.

461
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,310
I'll just go wherever you go.

462
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,920
Song.

463
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,460
You're a great driver.

464
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,300
Don't waste your skills.

465
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,180
A good driver should know which road to take.

466
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,820
What about you, then?

467
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,010
Right. What about you?

468
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,710
Don't concern yourself with me.

469
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,480
Thank you all for being so accommodating over the years.

470
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,720
I sincerely wish everyone all the best in the future.

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,160
It's what Mr. Lu wanted. Just take it.

Okay.

Hello, I'm Ren Pengfei.

Yes, that's right. I will make sure the smaller projects are concluded.

496
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,860
There's no other way but to close the company.

497
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,440
Meng, how could this have happened?

498
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,490
I was hoping to work here till I retire.

499
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,420
Now, it's all gone.

500
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,590
Now, now, don't cry.

501
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,950
Meng, Mr. Lu must feel so awful.

502
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,210
He cared so much about the company.

503
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:41,470
Now it's gone.

504
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,520
It's okay, Meng.

505
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,780
Never mind me.

506
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,350
You need to go and check on him.

507
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,800
He'll only listen to you.

508
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,800
I'm leaving.

509
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,520
Why are you here?

510
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,800
Good thing you came.

511
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,620
Tomorrow, Joint Capital will cease to exist.

512
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,570
You can take a last look.

513
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,360
Where did you get the money to buy the stocks?

514
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,700
I compiled it.

515
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,430
Compiled? You mean by borrowing?

516
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,700
I invested all of my money.

517
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,190
But it wasn't enough.

518
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,560
So I borrowed some from the bank.

519
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,840
I thought by having a Plan B, there wouldn't be a problem.

520
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,570
By Plan B, you mean a private placement stock

521
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,440
for a new energy vehicle?

522
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,520
I thought I could regain what I invested and more.

523
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,860
Then the cash flow wouldn't be affected.

524
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,420
But my luck was horrible.

525
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,690
The stocks were liquidated.

526
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,220
You were always risk-averse.

527
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,500
Why did you take the risk this time?

528
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,320
I've never made such a gamble.

529
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,870
This was the only time.

530
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,600
Because it's for my dad.

531
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,950
I'm sorry.

532
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,630
I'm partly to blame for He Yueluan screwing things up.

533
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,220
It's not your fault.

534
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,740
I should've realized they were not to be trusted.

535
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,450
Forget it.

536
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,230
In business, a loss is a loss.

537
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,570
I admit I failed.

538
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Let me make you some coffee.

539
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,670
Thank you.

540
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,230
Ning Meng, why don't you sit down?

541
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,470
Ning Meng, Joint Capital is the first company you joined

542
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,800
after graduating. Right?

543
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,220
I remember you told me then

544
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,230
you wanted to do investing.

545
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,620
But I hired you as my secretary.

546
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,050
And you did the job for three years.

547
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,360
It must've been hard for you.

548
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,560
I learned a lot.

549
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
Tell me.

550
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,950
Am I really such a difficult person to handle?

551
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,260
I mean, you even wrote a manual filled with precautions.

552
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,390
Were those not made up?

553
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,420
I'm telling you, you're really difficult.

554
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,770
Even on a small matter like making coffee,

555
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:57,330
it took me a long time to figure out what your preference was.

556
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,520
Not even algebra is as hard.

557
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,110
So you hold grudges?

558
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,510
But there were times I treated you nicely, right?

559
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,200
Yes.

560
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,280
I remember one time, a client gifted you lamb meat.

561
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,320
They said it was from prairie sheep raised with only milk.

562
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,150
They never fed on grass.

563
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,900
You said you were allergic to lamb.

564
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,230
So you asked me to take all of it home and eat it.

565
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,020
You couldn't be bothered.

566
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,060
I went home and I made lamb stew.

567
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,370
It smelled so nice. As if the juices dripping were milk.

568
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,000
I had tears in my eyes eating it.

569
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,560
Later, you had lamb hotpot and you were fine.

570
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,180
You know, you were only gullible then.

571
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,570
There's another time.

572
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,800
It was my first time going on a business trip with you. Do you remember?

573
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,100
The client was trying to get me to drink.

574
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,400
The wine glass was already up in my face. I was so nervous.

575
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,150
But you snatched the glass away

576
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,570
and said, "Why bother drinking with a little secretary? I'll drink."

577
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:05,220
Then you downed three glasses in one go. It was baijiu.

578
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,630
You vomited immediately after.

579
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:11,150
I vomited?

580
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,980
I don't remember that.

581
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,080
That meal was full of challenges.

582
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,020
They tried to make me drink again,

583
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,990
so you asked me to get cigarettes.

584
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,500
I went to many different shops

585
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,360
but couldn't find the cigarette you wanted.

586
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,250
I even called you to ask if I could get something else

587
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,420
or where I could find it.

588
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,360
Straight away, you yelled at me over the phone.

589
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,190
"You couldn't even do such a simple task!

590
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,440
Just leave! I'm going to fire you."

591
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,880
I was so terrified.

592
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,860
You just started working at the time. You didn't know anything.

593
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,710
I gave you a way out, but you wouldn't take it.

594
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,470
You were so clueless.

595
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,550
You called and solemnly asked if you could change to a different cigarette.

596
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,420
I couldn't believe it. I really almost fired you.

597
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,670
But I understood later. You were protecting me.

598
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,500
After that, you stopped asking me to go to those drinking sessions.

599
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,660
About that. Later, every time you drank too much, you'd call me at ungodly hours.

600
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,790
Later, every time you drank too much, you'd call me at ungodly hours.

601
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,220
I endured it.

602
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,820
A foul atmosphere like that,

603
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:21,190
I don't think is suitable for a naive girl like you.

604
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,500
At first, I didn't support you being an investor

605
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,870
because I thought the world of investment was too complicated.

606
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,870
It didn't suit you.

607
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,000
Ning Meng, I've never told you this.

608
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,670
Actually,

609
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,410
you are already a very talented investor.

610
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,600
If you had said this to me before,

611
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,560
I would've been overjoyed.

612
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,360
It's not too late, is it?

613
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,720
What do you plan to do now?

614
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,630
I... I don't have any plans.

615
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,070
This is probably the end of my investing career.

616
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,000
It's late. Let's go.

617
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,600
Mr. Lu, wait for me in the lobby.

618
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,280
I'll be right down.

619
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,600
Okay.

620
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:27,100

621
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,080

Mr. Lu, you should take these.

622
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,890
In my heart, you're still the best investor.

623
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,100
You left this at the company.

624
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,520
It's time to return it to its rightful owner.
