3
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,700
Sorry about that.

4
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,230
Sorry, it's a misunderstanding.

5
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,680
Just a misunderstanding.

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,480
Don't drink so much.

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,580
Qiqi, don't be angry.

8
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,630
We can talk it through at home.

9
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,310
Come.

10
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,122
What's your problem?

11
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,980
Let's go, Mengmeng.

12
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,870
- What's the matter?
- Mr. Jin, you're all right, yes?

13
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,220
Mr. Zhao, come. Let's drink.

14
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,000
- Let's go.
- Jin.
- Let's go.

15

Let's drink some more.

16
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,910
- What is it?
- Nothing.

17
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,730
It's nothing. Come on.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,900
What happened?

19
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,000
Last night, I took a look at his phone.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,240
I saw a message about a karaoke room reservation for today.

21
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,670
So I asked him what he was doing today.

22
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,220
He said he was doing overtime in the office.

23
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,530
Clearly, he was lying to me.

24
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,290
I couldn't accept it...

25
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,726
and went looking for him.

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,060
What did he say then?

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,320
He said after his overtime work,

28
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,840
he went to accompany his client to the karaoke room.

29
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,520
What if what he said is true?

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,270
If it was true, you barging in like that would have embarrassed him

31
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,310
in front of the clients.

32
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,320
Mengmeng, but my intuition tells me differently.

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,953
I think He doesn't love me as much as he used to.

34
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,720
Look at you.

35
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,530
You're overthinking things, making yourself miserable.

36
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,458
The way Old He dotes on you is clear to all of us.

37
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,530
There, there. Stop crying.

38
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,220
Good girl.

39
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't cry.

40
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,940
Let me ask you something.

41
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,970
If... he is indeed doing something behind your back,

42
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,160
will you forgive him or break up with him?

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,320
Is Old He really doing something behind my back?

44
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,170
Is he really cheating on me?

45
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm saying if.

46
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,500
If.

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,410
If...

48
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,262
If it was you, what would you do?

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,420
I'd choose to break up.

50
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,270
Old He and I have been together for so many years.

51
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,670
It's not that easy to break up with him.

52
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,942
But he made such a huge mistake.

53
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,160
How do you expect to get along in the future?

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,308
No, Old He couldn't possibly have cheated.

55
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,450
If... If I were to break up with him,

56
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,854
I don't know if I could live on my own.

57
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,600
All right, don't cry.

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,900
I told you, it's just an "if,"

59
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,550
It was just a hypothesis.

60
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,618
Don't cry now.

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,550
I have to be.

65
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,640
I specifically made sure to keep tomorrow night free

66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,600
so as to celebrate You Qi's birthday.

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,130
That's great.

68
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,350
Tomorrow, I plan to celebrate Qiqi's birthday with her.

69

<i>With you there, I hope you can coax her for me.</i>

70
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,230
She's been angry with me ever since the incident that day.

71
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,780
She wouldn't let me explain.

72
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,160
I'm hoping to use this chance to apologize to her.

73
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,790
You two do need a proper chat.

74
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,830
You Qi has been moody lately.

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,110
I know.

76
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,880
I'll send you the details for the reservation.

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
See you tomorrow night.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,940
Okay, see you.

79
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,900

Mengmeng, are you free tomorrow?

81
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,270
Tomorrow is You Qi's birthday.

82

Old He and I are planning a birthday celebration.

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,970
<i>I mentioned to you that they weren't on good terms.</i>

84
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,880
He wants to take this opportunity to apologize to her

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,500
and talk to her properly.

86
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,820
I won't intrude then.

87
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,913
Help me to wish You Qi a happy birthday.

88
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,950
Will do.

89
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,540

What a coincidence.

93
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,500
How have you been, my friend?

94
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,420
I've been good, my friend.

95
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,060
What's up with the weird speech?

96
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,244
So awkward.

Ning Meng.

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,066
Mengmeng, is he your former boss, Mr. Lu?

102
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,880
This is my good friend, You Qi.

Nice to meet you.

106
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,510
I'm He Yueluan of Renning Insurance.

107
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,110
Hello.

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,790
We'll go to our room first.

Okay, I'll be right there.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,284
Okay, let's go.

111
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,180
It's my friend's birthday today.

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,510
Mr. Lu, is everything fine with Qinhe?

113
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,380
So far so good.

114
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,340
Is Mr. Lu doing well?

115
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,840
He's well.

116
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,840
Don't keep your friends waiting. Go ahead.

117
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,720
Let's eat together some other time.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
Okay, see you.

119
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,340
Bye-bye.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Why did you talk to Ning Meng so weirdly?

121
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,670
What's your relationship right now?

122
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,230
You heard us, right?

123
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,830
We're friends.

124
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,120
Sure. It's good to be friends.

125
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,870
Anyway, what about the thing I asked you to find out?

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,490
Right now, Lu Guoyu is out of options.

127
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,100
Looks like your dad is about to win this equity war.

128
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,370
I must say, the older, the wiser.

129
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,420
Fortunately, your dad approached Shuangxun to be his guarantor.

130
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,570
But it's not Lu Guoyu

131
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,130
that I'm actually worried about.

132
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,610
It's Shuangxun.

133
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,310
But your dad approached Shuangxun, didn't he?

134
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,490
Think about it.

135
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,220
If it was only to keep Lu Guoyu in check,

136
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,350
why did they have to buy so many stocks?

137
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,630
This matter isn't as simple.

138
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,810
But there's no point in worrying.

139
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,010
The only thing we can do now is to be alert.

140
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,470
Keep a close watch on the situation.

141
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,970
Okay, let's order food. I'm hungry.

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,528
<i>[Happiness]</i>

143
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,810
Take a look.

144
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,632
Didn't you say you wanted a new camera?

145
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,220
Thanks, Mengmeng.

146
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,980
It better not be a short-lived passion.

147
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,790
Mengmeng always treats me the best.

148
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,390
Of course.

149
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,620
Dear, I also got you a present.

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,456
Do you like it?

151
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,410
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,520
I was wrong. I shouldn't have reacted like that.

153
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,700
Don't be angry, okay?

154
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,840
You lashed out at me in front of everyone that day.

155
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,300
Yes, I acted too rashly.

156
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,880
Those were my clients.

157
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,120
It was an important occasion.

158
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,234
Please understand.

159
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,180
That Chen Xiaoyi. Who is she to you?

160
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,590
She is nobody to me.

161
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,710
She's just a colleague.

162
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,870
You dare swear on it?

163
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,770
Why wouldn't I?

164
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,730
Tell me. I'm okay with any detrimental curse.

165
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,418
Forget it. I'm not that childish.

166
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:42,320
So you're no longer angry, right?

167
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,220
Let me put it on for you.

168
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,914
It's lovely.

169
00:10:56,914 --> 00:11:00,030
It would be even more lovely if the person smiled.

170
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,170
It's nice even if I'm not smiling.

171
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,640
There, it's beautiful.

172
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,400
Listen. This friend of mine has the mental age of a three-year-old.

173
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,640
Five at most.

174
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,780
You must take good care of her. Don't bully her.

175
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,980
If you dare bully her, I'll make you pay.

176
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't worry.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,670
I'm grateful if Qiqi isn't bullying me instead.

178
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,710
You should count yourself lucky to have me bully you.

179
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,340
Back then, many men dreamed of having me bully them.

180
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,450
But I picked you.

181
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,266
Yes, I sure am lucky.

182
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,500
Come, have tea in place of wine.

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,970
- Wishing Qiqi a happy birthday.
- Thank you.

184
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,100
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

185
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,181
What's wrong with you? Your heart's not in it.

186
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,702
I'm tired. Let's take a break.

187
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,080
<i>[Shuangxun continues to buy up Qinhe stocks and has become the biggest shareholder!]</i>

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,880
What's the matter?

189
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,396
The thing I was worried about happened.

190
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,350
"Shuangxun buys more than 20% of Qinhe's stocks."

191
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,050
What's going on?

192
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,354
Shuangxun agreeing to work with my dad was a mere ruse.

193
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:52,648
Their real goal is to acquire the ownership of Qinhe.

194
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,840
Shuangxun is already the biggest shareholder.

195
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,960
Once their share reaches 30%, it will trigger a tender offer.

196
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
What are you going to do?

197
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,710
Help me gather the stocks.

198
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,538
I'll take care of the funding.

199
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,362
I have to take back more stocks.

200
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,710
How many are you talking about?

201
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,900
I calculated. From the secondary market,

202
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,291
I should be able to acquire 2% of the stocks.

203
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you have the money for it?

204
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,536
2% isn't a small sum.

205
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,380
Don't tell me you're going to liquidate your assets.

206
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,420
I still have a private placement stock in hand.

207
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,140
Its performance is looking favorable.

208
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,690
If I sell it off, I should be able to make up the financial leverage.

209
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,946
The old man is feeling the heat.

210
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,100
I have to help him.

211
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,280
With his ailing health,

212
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,780
I worry he might not be able to take the toll.

213
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,672
Even if you get the 2%, what about the rest?

214
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,250
Don't worry. I have a plan.

215
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,240
<i>[Shuangxun becomes Qinhe's biggest shareholder. Qinhe may lose control over the company!]</i>

216
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Hello, Mr. Lu.

217
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,920
<i>Can you help me set up a time with Mr. He?</i>

218
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,020
- You wish to meet with He Yueluan?
<i>- Yes.</i>

219
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,110
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

220
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,730
You must have heard about Shuangxun.

221
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,238
This is how it all started.

222
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,370
My dad wanted to get a big shareholder to keep Lu Guoyu in check.

223
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,918
But he never thought Shuangxun would betray his trust.

224
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,210
They did not stop when they were supposed to.

225
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,730
Of course, this is what my dad thinks.

226
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,088
From my point of view,

227
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:58,880
Shuangxun's intention was never good, to begin with.

228
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,284
Their real motive was to acquire Qinhe.

229
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,580
I believe that at this time,

230
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,250
he would have more reasons not to stop.

231
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,710
They will continue to accumulate stocks.

232
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,180
Because they know. Once their share reaches 30%,

233
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,520
a tender offer will be triggered.

234
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,348
When that happens, they will decide what happens to Qinhe.

235
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:24,486
But it looks like Shuangxun's arrow is reaching the end of its flight.

236
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:27,350
Lately, their rate of stock acquisition is very slow.

237
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,170
It has almost stopped.

238
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,586
I'm guessing they're running out of capital.

239
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:35,150
And judging from their method of acquisition,

240
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,450
their capital is heavily reliant on leverage.

241
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,320
They're already deep in debt.

242
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,704
Doing this is risky.

243
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:46,042
One slight mistake and that could be the end of them.

244
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,710
Is it worth it for Shuangxun to take such a risk?

245
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:52,838
The investment market is never short on careerists.

246
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:56,550
As long as they're able to acquire Qinhe,

247
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,650
the profit would be ten times what they have now.

248
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,930
You asked me to set a meeting with He Yueluan.

249
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,402
Is it to discuss taking a concerted action?

250
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,754
So far, Shuangxun had made four acquisitions.

251
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,870
Their share is now at 22 percent.

252
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,500
My dad and the other Qinhe executives only have 21 percent.

253
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,370
Adding that to the 2% I purchased,

254
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,580
that makes 23% in total.

255
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,230
So you need another seven percent.

256
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,420
And it so happens that He Yueluan's Renning Insurance has that seven percent.

257
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,710
If Qinhe can come to an agreement with Renning Insurance

258
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:40,138
for a concerted action, the share ratio will then reach 30%.

259
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,808
So Qinhe must get Renning Insurance on their side.

260
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,552
My dad has been down on himself lately.

261
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,194
He feels like he let Qinhe down.

262
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,894
So, no matter what,

263
00:16:56,894 --> 00:17:00,336
I have to help him get over this hurdle.

264
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:02,600
Is Mr. Lu all right?

265
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,120
He's fine for now.

266
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,540
He's hanging in there on a sliver of hope.

267
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,904
From what I know,

268
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:14,010
Mr. Lu should be acquainted with their management.

269
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,950
Why didn't he look for them?

270
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,040
Just recently, Renning had an internal restructuring. Right?

271
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,632
My dad's old acquaintances have all been replaced.

272
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,830
One more thing. I will be telling my senior about this.

273
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,230
But I won't go into the details.

274
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,976
Got it, my friend.

275
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,630
I'll be off then.

276
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,930
See you, my friend.

277
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,850
I disagree.

278
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,290
Did you think that was how I'd react?

279
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,714
Don't joke, please.

280
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,146
Although I know that this man named Lu Jiming covets my girlfriend,

281
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:38,566
I will remain professional.

282
00:18:38,566 --> 00:18:41,860
You have my support on this matter.

283
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,730
He is your ex-boss after all.

284
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,670
You should help him out.

285
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,148
Your boyfriend isn't that petty.

286
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:53,060
Not only are you not petty, but you're also of exemplary conduct.

287
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,608
- That description is a little...
- Here.

288
00:18:56,608 --> 00:19:00,520
Is this all the reward I'm getting?

289
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,560
You deserve it.

290
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,140
All right.

291
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,080
Coming.

292
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,540
Mengmeng, did you just finish work?

293
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,096
Yes.

294
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,940
You haven't eaten, have you?

295
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,790
I already have.

296
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,748
But I cooked the food today.

297
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:31,500
- You cooked?
- Yes.

298
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,330
Chopsticks. Try it.

299
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,790
You can give me some feedback.

300
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,260
Gosh. The sun must have risen from the west today.

301
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,280
You Qi actually cooked.

302
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,920
She's been cooking these past two days.

303
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,590
Take the tomato egg stir fry as an example. It tastes different every time.

304
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,070
It's because I want to practice more.

305
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,630
Try the one I made today. I think it's better than the one I made yesterday.

306
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,730
- Tastes pretty good.
- There's an improvement.

307
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,160
I told you. I can definitely master cooking.

308
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,770
Is it not good?

309
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,480
No, not at all. It's very good.

310
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,426
The reason I came today is to ask Old He for a favor.

311
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,080
No problem.

312
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,030
Wait! She hasn't said what it is yet.

313
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,270
No matter what it is, as long as Mengmeng asked, you ought to help.

314
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:32,076
Here's the thing. See, a friend of mine...

315
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:37,550
You guys met him. It was the guy we met at the restaurant on You Qi's birthday, Mr. Lu Jiming.

316
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,000
Mr. Lu, I remember.

317
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,720
He'd like to meet you.

318
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm sure you've heard about what's happening with Shuangxun and Qinhe.

319
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,910
Yes, I have.

320
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,238
Our company has stocks in Qinhe.

321
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,590
I couldn't avoid it even if I tried.

322
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,514
Qinhe's boss is Mr. Lu's father.

323
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,280
You know the dire situation Qinhe is in.

324
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,780
Mr. Lu would like to talk to you to see if it's possible to work with Renning.

325
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,180
Old He, set up a time to meet him then.

326
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,270
Okay. I'll ask the secretary to make an appointment to meet up.

327
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,776
That's great. Thanks, Old He.

328
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,600
So you're saying, you hope Renning Insurance and Qinhe

329
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,100
could reach a concerted action. Right?

330
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,100
Yes. I came today hoping to come to an agreement.

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Mr. He, if you have any doubts, do voice them.

332
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,970
Since you are Ning Meng's friend, I'll be straight with you.

333
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,500
Actually, before you came to look for me,

334
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,400
Shuangxun had contacted our company.

335
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
It was expected.

336
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,500
If we were able to think of this, I'm sure they could too.

337
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,200
Looks like Mr. Lu does know Shuangxun very well.

338
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
I won't beat around the bush then.

339
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Before you came,

340
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,800
I had a meeting with the company's executives and the board of directors.

341
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,300
On the matter of a concerted action with Qinhe, everyone

342
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,400
is in favor of it.

343
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,600
After all, Qinhe is a well-qualified company.

344
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,400
Mr. Lu Senior had contributed a lot to the environmental business over the years.

345
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,000
It's well known in the industry.

346
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,800
Be it sentiment or reason, I am more than happy to help.

347
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,200
Thank you, on behalf of my father.

348
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,000
We're grateful to you for making the right decision.

349
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,300
Mr. Lu, you're being too polite.

350
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,100
You and Ning Meng are good friends.

351
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,800
And Ning Meng and my girlfriend have been best friends forever.

352
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,600
As such, our relationship is much closer than normal.

353
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Besides, on a personal note,

354
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
it's my honor to be able to help Mr. Lu Senior.

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,800
Well then, Mr. He, when do you think we could sign the contract?

356
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Here's the thing, Mr. Lu.

357
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,200
We are a large company.

358
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,400
Our internal structure is more complicated.

359
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
Our headquarters are not in Shanghai but in Shenzhen.

360
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
So, it's going to take a while to go through due process.

361
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
But rest assured.

362
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,000
Let Mr. Lu Senior know not to fret, too.

363
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,800
I will make sure the headquarters processes this matter quickly.

364
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,800
Okay.

365
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll be waiting for your news then.

366
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,300
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

367
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,300
Excuse me, Mr. He. Sorry to interrupt.

368
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,800
There are some urgent documents that require your signature.

369
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,400
Let's dismiss for today.

370
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,700
Okay, you go ahead. I'll be off.

371
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,100
- I won't see you out then.
- No need.

372
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Thanks, Old He.

373
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Hopefully, everything goes well.

374
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,800
Yeah.

375
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,400
Mr. Lu, you go ahead.

376
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
I need the restroom.

377
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
- Okay.
- See you.

378
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
I know you.

379
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You are Mr. He's girlfriend's best friend, right?

380
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
Yes.

381
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Is Mr. He's girlfriend doing okay?

382
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,100
She's good.

383
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,600
He apologized to her for what happened that time.

384
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Mr. He sure has a good temper.

385
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
He was able to keep his cool

386
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
when dealing with such an immature girlfriend.

387
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Outsiders shouldn't butt in a couple's affairs.

388
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,200
But I've been there throughout their relationship.

389
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,100
They've been together since university.

390
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,800
They witnessed each other's graduation and stepping into adulthood.

391
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,500
After they graduated, they put each other in their future plans.

392
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
They struggled together in Shenzhen and Shanghai.

393
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Such a relationship really is hard to come by.

394
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,200
Don't you think so?

395
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,500
Is it?

396
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
A deep relationship can't be explained in a few words.

397
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,200
Is Mr. Lu not doing very well?

398
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah.

399
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,800
Being in that situation has to be tough.

400
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,400
Senior, where are we going?

401
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
You'll find out soon.

402
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,800
You're so mysterious.

403
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,500
Could it be a surprise?

404
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Sorry. Let me get the call.

405
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,000
Hello?

406
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,600
<i>- Hello, Mr. Su.</i>
- Mr. Zhai.

407
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
<i>About the bond issuance, I haven't had a chance to thank you.</i>

408
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,000
<i>I'll send you the thank you gift tomorrow.</i>

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You're too kind, Mr. Zhai.

410
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,600
I'm driving right now. It's inconvenient to talk.

411
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
I'll get back to you later.

412
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>Okay. That's good.</i>

413
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,200
Bye.

414
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,900
I helped out a friend, so he wants to thank me.

415
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,400
This friend of mine loves giving local specialties to others.

416
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,400
What local specialty?

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,500
He is from Zhoushan. So it's mostly sea produce.

418
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,600
When I get it, I'll cook it for you.

419
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,800
Well? Do you like this surprise?

420
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,600
It's just been renovated.

421
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,700
Is this your new house?

422
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Why didn't you tell me? I didn't bring a housewarming gift.

423
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
What gift?

424
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
You're no outsider.

425
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Besides, this house has everything.

426
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Aside from a lady boss.

427
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,100
Looks more like you're looking for free labor.

428
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,400
This house is so big.

429
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,300
It would be exhausting to clean it.

430
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,800
I still prefer my little abode.

431
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
It's easy and quick to clean.

432
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
And it's near my workplace.

433
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,200
Why worry about that? There's the house cleaning service.

434
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,600
I should serve you first.

435
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Let me get you some water.

436
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,100
This house must be very expensive.

437
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,800
Is the loan repayment stressful?

438
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I paid in full.

439
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Don't look so surprised.

440
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
In a few years, you'd be able to afford one too.

441
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
Have some wine.

442
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,200
It will be late when we finish the movie.

443
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,700
How about you just stay the night?

444
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:32,374
I can't. I promised You Qi today to do yoga with her.

445
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,500
Maybe next time.

446
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,200
Then after we finish the movie, we can get a designated driver.

447
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,300
I'll see you home.

448
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,800
Ms. Shi, don't you have a strategic planning meeting this afternoon?

449
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,800
It's been canceled.

450
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Lu couldn't make it.

451
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,300
Recently, Mr. Lu must be deeply troubled.

452
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,800
I reckon the profit this year won't be too good.

453
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,000
Why?

454
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,400
He has a private placement stock in new energy vehicles.

455
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Its ban is about to be lifted.

456
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Recently, it's been plagued by negative press.

457
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,800
The stock keeps falling.

458
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,400
There's no guarantee it would bounce back.

459
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,050
I'll go and check on him soon.

460
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,800
Hopefully, he'll get through it.

461
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm going to get changed.

462
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,200
Hello.

463
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,600
<i>Ning Meng, any update from Renning Insurance?</i>

464
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
I asked Old He about it yesterday.

465
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,700
He said it was undergoing the process.

466
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,900
<i>I see. Tell me once there's an update.</i>

467
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,860
Old He, how are things with Lu Jiming?

468
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,350
When will the agreement be ready for signing?

469
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,228
Don't worry about it. It's going through the process.

470
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,900
But I've been keeping an eye on Shuangxun, too.

471
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,840
There hasn't been any movement.

472
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,060
They're probably at their wit's end.

473
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,400
This should buy us more time.

474
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,170
I know. But it's been a while.

475
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,130
And it's still undergoing the process.

476
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,154
Can't you speed things up a little?

477
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:06,700
Old He, just help bring it up again.

478
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,944
Easy for you to say. You think this is some simple matter?

479
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,576
The fact of the matter is, we're asking for a favor.

480
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:19,464
You can't expect me to push my superiors time and time again.

481
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,550
I understand.

482
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,730
Anyway, I'm counting on you, Old He.

483
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,070
Mengmeng, he couldn't do much because he was away.

484
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,380
But now, he'll put in more effort. Don't worry.

485
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,591
<i>[He Yueluan said it was under process. But his superior has agreed.]</i>

486
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,211
<i>[It shouldn't be a problem. So he asks for your patience.]</i>

487
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,010
Mingming, are the dishes today too bland and insipid?

488
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,362
I could ask the caretaker to cut some spiced beef.

489
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:01,718
It's okay, Madam Liu. The food is fine.

490
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,460
Is it because of my dad's high blood pressure?

491
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,860
That's right. It's a little high lately.

492
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,970
The doctor reminded us to keep the diet bland.

493
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,550
See the multigrain rice?

494
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,830
Dad.

495
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,860
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

496
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,880
Wait. What's up with you lately?

497
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,610
Why is it only vegetable dishes? I don't even see any oil droplets.

498
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,010
Also, look at the rice. And look at that.

499
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,110
Is this chicken feed?

500
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:41,280
It's not that bad. This is five-grain rice. It's good for you.

501
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,960
It's per the doctor's advice. You need a lighter diet. Eat more multigrains.

502
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,680
Is it too dry to swallow?

503
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,060
Oh, right.

504
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,430
I made Tremella soup. I'll get some for you two.

505
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,232
Dad, please have some.

506
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:12,990
Multigrain rice is good for your health.

507
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,038
Have you finished the supplements I got for you?

508
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,670
Not yet.

509
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,976
Did Shuangxun contact you again?

510
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,224
That Yan Shuangxun...

511
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,676
is a wolf.

512
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:38,760
An ungrateful traitor.

513
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,160
He should be ashamed to see me.

514
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,850
Honestly, we should have sensed something was up when they made

515
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,230
sweeping purchases of the stocks.

516
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,596
What is the point of saying this in hindsight?

517
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:57,040
I'm just making an objective analysis.

518
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,210
Dad.

519
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,380
The market now is way different from what you had back then.

520
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,904
The financial circle...

521
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,620
is much more complicated than before.

522
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,700
- When handling something, I think we ought to...
- That's enough.

523
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,540
You're in no position to teach me.

524
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,640
Dad, I think you need to be more patient.

525
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,080
It's normal for humans to make mistakes.

526
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,370
What's done is done.

527
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,330
If there's a problem, we'll just figure it out together.

528
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,330
Learn from it and don't make the same mistake again.

529
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,030
Lu Jiming, you helped me out with Qinhe.

530
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,370
So I'm supposed to sit here and listen to your lecture?

531
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,810
I haven't asked you yet.

532
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,762
Tell me honestly.

533
00:35:48,762 --> 00:35:51,590
Where did you get the money to buy stocks?

534
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,400
It's from...

535
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,856
I had my ways.

536
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,858
Is the money clean?

537
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,130
How could you possibly get so much money?

538
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,760
Dad, regarding the money, there's no need to explain it to you.

539
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,204
No need?

540
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:08,420
Hold up. What's with your attitude?

541
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,741
You were just telling me to be patient. You were giving me an earful.

542
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:16,270
Now I ask you one thing and you lose your patience.

543
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,450
- No, Dad.
- I'm warning you.

544
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,318
Don't overestimate yourself.

545
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,180
Don't simply touch the money that shouldn't be touched.

546
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,320
Do you hear me?

547
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:36,660
Come on. You just won't listen to whatever I have to say. Is that it?

548
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,680
I was going to...

549
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
Forget it. Why did I fret about you?

550
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,314
Did I ask you to?

551
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:47,930
So long as you don't make trouble for me.

552
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,700
Eat your food with the soup.

553
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,560
And leave when you're finished.

554
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,050
You two...

555
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,870
What is the matter with you two?

556
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,390
Why can't you just get along?

557
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,330
Weren't you two talking?

558
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,670
Why did you butt heads again?

559
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,660
To be frank, your dad feels bad for troubling you.

560
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,668
He hasn't been eating and sleeping well these days.

561
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,280
So don't argue with him.

562
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,470
No, Madam Liu. I want to persuade him.

563
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,610
But what's the point? Would he listen?

564
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,860
His ego is too big and he can't let it go.

565
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:27,330
Your father just doesn't want to implicate you.

566
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,980
He doesn't want you to spend any more money.

567
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,370
Don't worry, Madam Liu.

568
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,150
I'll figure out what to do about the money.

569
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,800
Then, go and get your dad to come to eat.

570
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,100
He hasn't eaten yet.

571
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,590
Okay.

572
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,790
Hey. Once you get the bonus from the project,

573
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,440
you should listen to me and buy a car.

574
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,800
Taking the subway to get to and from work is too tiring.

575
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,468
It's fine. I'm used to it.

576
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,912
I almost forgot.

577
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:30,600
Your boyfriend can be your chauffeur.

578
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,500
No wonder you don't need a car. It's all good.

579
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,290
Sorry, excuse me.

580
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,834
How do I use WeChat Pay?

581
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,208
Click open and then pay.

582
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:45,121
Yes, click that.

583
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:47,850
Receive payment. There you go.

584
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

585
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,140
I just returned from overseas.

586
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,936
I'm clueless about a lot of things.

587
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,130
Senior?

588
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,006
Ning Meng? You're Ning Meng, right?

589
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:09,310
Yes, I am. Long time no see.

590
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,220
<i>[Frieda Restaurant]</i>

591
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,020
You're so different from back when you were in university.

592
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,980
I almost couldn't recognize you.

593
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,570
And you've not changed much.

594
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,530
You're still as beautiful.

595
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,830
Thanks.

596
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,792
How long are you planning to stay this time?

597
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:26,754
I'm leaving tomorrow.

598
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:31,116
I was going to stay longer to keep my parents company.

599
00:39:31,116 --> 00:39:33,850
But my child is abroad and is still young.

600
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,770
She fell ill after I left.

601
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,090
Her father isn't good at taking care of her.

602
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,890
What to do? My heart is with my girl.

603
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,796
Here, this is my daughter.

604
00:39:45,796 --> 00:39:48,201
How adorable. She's like a doll.

605
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,700
You should have one of your own if you find her adorable.

606
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,800
With Weiran. You guys should have a baby, too.

607
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,620
You and Weiran are together, right?

608
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,260
That's good.

609
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,226
You had a crush on Weiran during your college days, right?

610
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,064
I remember he had a CD.

611
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:19,160
You gifted it to him, right?

612
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,420
- That... Well, I... Well...
- Don't misunderstand.

613
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,330
I am not implying anything else.

614
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,850
I just thought fate worked in mysterious ways.

615
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,940
At the time, Weiran mentioned you to me.

616
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,630
He said you were smart and could answer all sorts of questions.

617
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,550
It's not like I really could answer everything.

618
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:43,700
Ning Meng, Weiran went through a lot overseas.

619
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,370
It was tough on him.

620
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,838
As for me,

621
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,030
I feel bad about a lot of things.

622
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:54,828
Now that you two are together, I'm really glad.

623
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,810
I wish you two the best.

624
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,320
Thanks.

625
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,438
By the way, have you two ever quarreled?

626
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,770
No. Why?

627
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,810
It's nothing.

628
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,770
I just want to give you a gentle reminder.

629
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,220
If he gets angry in the future,

630
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,980
I hope you'll be understanding.

631
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,840
Give him some space.

632
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,260
Don't fight with him.

633
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,516
When he calms down, you can talk it through then.

634
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,390
This is because of me.

635
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,604
It's my fault.

636
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

637
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,380
My ride is here. I have to go.

638
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,940
If you need anything, you can contact me through WeChat.

639
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,220
Sure, I will.

640
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,180
Wishing you two happiness.

641
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,520
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

642
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,260
Bye, Senior.

643
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,530
This seafood was sent by my friend.

644
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,930
They're really fresh. Eat while they're still hot.

645
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,300
Let's have a clink first.

646
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,950
Try this one I made.

647
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,450
Okay.

648
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,310
It's good.

649
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,298
You're talented.

650
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,400
I bumped into someone today.
