00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,310
Mr. Lu, will you change your mind if I can settle

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,550
the issue of staff placement?

5
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,700
To be honest, I wouldn't recommend that.

6
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,230
You want to replace all of your equipment and to rebuild the factory,

7
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,130
which means the factory is inoperable.

8
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,382
Have you considered how much loss that is?

9
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,570
Will the number of new orders match your production capacity

10
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,550
after the upgrade?

11
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,566
Otherwise, the increased production lines will go to waste.

12
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,090
There's no turning back.

13
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,930
Mr. Yuan, have you thought about these?

14
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,090
You have good intentions.

15
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,510
Working in this industry, technology is a crucial part.

16
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,310
In the long run, it's driven by the people. Right?

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,250
Mr. Yuan, how about this?

18
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,170
Regarding your vision of technology reform, why don't you take it slow?

19
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,190
Reform the production lines in stages.

20
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,743
Then, the workers can have some buffer time.

21
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
All right.

22
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,274

25
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,050
Okay.

26
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,700
You don't need to be worried, Mr. Yuan.

27
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,370
You should have confidence in your product.

28
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,310
Well, at least I'm quite happy with it.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,270
Did Mr. Lu use it before?

30
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,880
I stayed in an express hotel yesterday.

31
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,030
I saw that the beddings they used are your product.

32
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,270
To be honest, I think your product is as good as a five-star hotel.

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,420
It's such an honor to receive that compliment from you.

34
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm thinking... You are lacking a powerful branding

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,340

36
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,130

As far as I know,

69

my dad was someone who focused on the factory wholeheartedly.

He didn't care much about me.

When I scored good marks on an examination or won some competitions,

73
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,980
only then would he come home,

You see this as a way for you to grab his attention.

You wanted to revive Phoenix Industry Samples Factory

but... this mindset is instilled in my subconscious.

84
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,900

88
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,320
parent-teacher meetings and getting parents' signatures.

89
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,290
But my father wouldn't love me less if I got a bad grade.

90
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,970
I think all parents are the same.

91
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,600
They wouldn't give up or not love their child just because

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,110
they are not great or not perfect enough.

That day was my birthday.

97
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,150
When I was a kid, my dad didn't celebrate my birthday with me

98
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,320
because he was busy in the factory.

99
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,110
There was a typhoon that day.

100
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,370
They closed the factory.

101
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,180
I thought he would be free

102
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,920
to have a meal with my mom and me.

103
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,020
But he didn't.

104
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,420
He didn't even sit down.

105
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,232
I had a fight with him because of this.

106
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,930
I told him, "All you care about is money and your stocks."

107
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,422
"Is money that important?"

108
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,152
It was quite offensive.

109
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,900
I guess, what he worried about wasn't the stocks

110
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,664
but the workers who were dealing with the flood.

111

112

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,610
Of course.

168
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,638
But no longer on paper.

169
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:58,300
We'll keep it updated on our official account.

170
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Remember to follow us.

171
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,220
- Sure!
- Okay.

172
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,280
Rest assured, Mr. Yuan.

173
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,350
The door of Joint Capital and Eaglestone Capital is always open for you.

174
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,540
All right, goodbye then.

175
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,280
Till we meet again.

176
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,960
You are very daring.

178
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,330
The door of Joint Capital and Eaglestone Capital is always open for you.

179
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,200
Do you own the companies?

180
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,550
I'm just saying what your hidden message is.

181
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,150
All the suggestions are from me.

182
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,910
Why did he thank you?

183
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,760
He said you helped him to retrieve the most precious thing.

184
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,160
What is it?

185
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,800
It's a secret.

186
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,256

187
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,350
Mr. Zeng.

188
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,540
Lu Mingming, this is where you stayed for these days?

189
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,640
What's wrong?

190
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,948
Wow, what an eye-opener.

191
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,000
Ning Meng, are you feeling better?

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,380
Yes. Thanks for asking, Mr. Zeng.

193
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,590
Why are you here?

194
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm here to go through the thick and thin with you.

195
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,490
Why?

196
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,900
Why don't you come later?

197
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,010
- Are you done here?
- Yes.

198
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,770
Great! Mine is done, too.

199
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,200
How about this?

200
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Let's go chill somewhere else tonight. Let's celebrate.

201
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,880
We canceled the investment plan. There's nothing to celebrate.

202
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,774
Let's celebrate saving money.

203
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:24,200
I know of a great place.

204
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,050
Let's go have fun today. What do you think?

205
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,450
No, thanks.

206
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,070
I think it's a good idea. We worked so hard, so let's relax.

207
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,150
Are you feeling so much better

208
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,390
and you can mess around?

209
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,790
I went to the convenience shop to get some information.

210
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,150
I bought a lot of snacks and beers.

211
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,570
It's hard to bring them back with us. Let's finish them.

212
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,118
I'm the best at this.

213
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,790
While I was waiting for you, I found an amazing place.

214
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,018
A perfect place for a spring night like this.

215
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,150
What do you think? Let's go.

216
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,170
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

217
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,632
Let's go.

218
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,950
Yes, you shouldn't invest. I agree with you.

219
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,030
Although we didn't invest, Mr. Yuan seems to accept Mr. Lu's advice.

220
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,910
I think that's great. Phoenix is getting better.

221
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,776
Sure. Cheers!

222
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,890
Zeng Yuhang, what kind of place is this?

223
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,221
Wait. Dude, can you be more romantic?

224
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,320
Look at the view, feel the breeze. Just enjoy.

225
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,280
This is as good as the Bund.

226
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,640
Go home and get your eyes treated. You are so blind.

227
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,130
You are as blind as a bat.

228
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,200
Ning Meng was such great staff and you scared her off.

229
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
You must be regretting it now.

230
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,890
Childish. I'm too annoyed to talk to you.

231
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,250
Look at his bad temper. I'm the only one who can stand him.

232
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,220
Mr. Zeng, I've always wanted to ask you.

233
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,150
It's okay. You can ask me anything. What is it?

234
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,520
How did you and Mr. Lu become friends?

235
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,068
Your personality and temper are so different from his.

236
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,320
Well, it's an unfortunate fate.

237
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,210
You never met the young version of him.

238
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,610
- When he was a kid...
- Are you talking about me?

239
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,910
Wait! Didn't you say you were annoyed?

240
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,556
Fine, I'll say it out loud.

241
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,780
I used to admire Lu Mingming when he was a kid.

242
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,970
Lu Mingming, Tiantian, and I went to the same junior high school.

243
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,700
I used to fool around.

244
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,104
Getting into fights, skipping classes, living a carefree life.

245
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,920
Then I offended a group of gangsters.

246
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,830
They stopped me at the back of the school.

247
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,330
He happened to pass by and saw what happened,

248
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,906
and then we became friends.

249
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,600
Don't fast forward this.

250
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,220
Tell her in detail about that incident.

251
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,634
Sure, in detail.

252
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,454
He didn't want to help me.

253
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:10,064
But I was so badly beaten, so he stepped up.

254
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:11,280
Let me tell you.

255
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,470
This was the first time I met someone who was good at studying

256
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,780
and could be so harsh and bold.

257
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,672
He literally beat the gangster and they ran.

258
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:21,836
Since then, he has been my boss.

259
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,590
A hero is saving the damsel.

260
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,310
More like a zero.

261
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,560
Since then, I wanted to be friends with him.

262
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,860
Guess what.

263
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,400
He told me I wasn't worthy of being his friend.

264
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,892
He despised me.

265
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,180
I still despise you now.

266
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,636
Well, me too!

267
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:40,220
I'm telling a story. Don't cut in.

268
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,920
After spending time with him, I changed.

269
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,360
My grades improved.

270
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,580
Do you think this can be counted as changing to be better?

271
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,760
Since then,

272
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,404
I taught him to be good and he taught me to be bad.

273
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:58,138
Hey, why didn't you mention all the happy moments I brought to you?

274
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,480
Ning Meng, I'm not sure an obedient girl like you can understand this.

275
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,780
Do you think I'm an obedient girl?

276
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,090
Of course.

277
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,230
Did you rebel, too? No way.

278
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,068
Well, not as bad as you.

279
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,362
But more or less.

280
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,780
When I was a kid, back in primary school,

281
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,488
my dad went bankrupt.

282
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,350
We were so poor.

283
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,160
I used to climb over the wall to help my classmates to buy snacks to earn some pocket money.

284
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,710
And when I came back, I stuffed all the snacks in my pocket

285
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,862
like a kangaroo and I always got caught.

286
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:36,600
I didn't know you had been there.

287
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,906
You mentioned bankruptcy.

288
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
If you are comfortable...

289
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,210
It's okay if you don't want to talk about it.

290
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,214
No, it's fine.

291
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:52,670
Well, when I was in primary school,

292
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,190
my dad started a business.

293
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,730
He was in the rechargeable battery business.

294
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,196
However, it wasn't a smooth journey.

295
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:03,160
When he was about to develop the new technology,

296
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,190
the financial chain was disrupted.

297
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,330
So my dad went bankrupt.

298
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,330
Back then, all of our savings were used to pay back the debt,

299
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,390
and we were still in debt.

300
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,880
You might find it hard to imagine.

301
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,680
But my parents never bought a single new shirt for years.

302
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,200
They only spent the money on me.

303
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,730
When I was about to graduate from primary school,

304
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,770
we finally paid off the debt.

305
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,636
Then it got better.

306
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,040
You were so into investment, is it because of this?

307
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,110
I especially remember that moment.

308
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,270
My dad was extremely depressed.

309
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:48,402
But he never vented on my mom or me.

310
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,748
I was too young back then.

311
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:56,106
All I knew was if we had the investment,

312
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,190
then we wouldn't have been in trouble.

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,430
Ning Meng, I think you are already sailing in the investment world.

314
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,890
You can do this! I have faith in you.

315
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,420
Cheers!

316
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,420
Well, you guys can carry on.

317
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,850
Lu Mingming, give me your room card. I need to make a phone call.

318
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,492
Why can't you do it here?

319
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,940
It's windy here. Hurry up, I'm cold.

320
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,070
Now you know it's cold. What a bad location you chose.

321
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,790
Hello? Yes, I'm listening.

322
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,580
Listen to his voice. Disgusting.

323
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,426
I guess it's a girl.

324
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,146
Hey, your parents are a great couple.

325
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:03,644
They conquered such a major crisis together.

326
00:22:03,644 --> 00:22:05,590
Well, they had to.

327
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,410
My mom told me there are only three of us in the family and we must stick together.

328
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,170
Ning Meng, to be honest,

329
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,450
I envy you.

330
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:31,110
For as long as I can remember, my family is never at peace.

331
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,500
My parents quarrel every day.

332
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,880
My father only thinks about work.

333
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,080
From his point of view, home is only a place to sleep.

334
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,710
My mother couldn't take it.

335
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,880
She tried to endure, and then they'd fight when she's had enough.

336
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,700
This had been going on for ten years.

337
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,022
When they were sick of that, there was no more spark between them.

338
00:23:00,022 --> 00:23:02,690
Divorce was the only way.

339
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,252
I was only ten.

340
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,472
When my mother was still around, I was tired of their fights.

341
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:18,000
Then my mother left us.

342
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,169
My father and I talked less than three words a day.

343
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:23,734
My home became so quiet.

344
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,820
Anyway, I never felt right.

345
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,490
<i>There's no way we can communicate.</i>

346
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,160
<i>I can't live like this anymore!</i>

347
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,168
<i>Whatever!</i>

348
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,064
<i>Fine!</i>

349
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:38,430
<i>How about our kid?</i>

350
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,800
<i>Kid? Don't you dare use my kid as an excuse.</i>

351
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,400
<i>I'm not talking about the child!</i>

352
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
<i>He'll not be happy with you!</i>

353
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,000
<i>Listen. If you want to leave, just go!</i>

354
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,580
<i>My kid is staying with me.</i>

355
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,830
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

356
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,640
<i>Did you finish your homework?</i>

357
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,280
<i>You never pay attention to your studies.</i>

358
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,020
<i>Your mind is everywhere.</i>

359
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,680
<i>How could you score a good grade?</i>

360
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,070
<i>Hey! What's that action?</i>

361
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:20,002
<i>You're using a headset now?</i>

362
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,994
<i>Stand right there. Go back.</i>

363
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:30,128
<i>Dad, can you and Mom stop fighting?</i>

364
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:31,880
<i>Then Mom will not leave.</i>

365
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,740
<i>Stop messing with the adult's stuff.</i>

366
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,645
<i>Score a good grade, then I'll buy you a new one.</i>

367
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,210
<i>Mom, I ranked first in class again!</i>

368
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,590
<i>Really? Mingming is awesome.</i>

369
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,400
<i>What do you want as a gift?</i>

370
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,100
<i>Mom, I don't want a gift.</i>

371
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,550
<i>Can you come back?</i>

372
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,730
<i>Why are you standing there?</i>

373
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,660
<i>Come over and have dinner.</i>

374
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,720
<i>Do not throw your bag like this. Understand?</i>

375
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,218
<i>Is my mom not coming back?</i>

376
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,040
<i>Your mom left.</i>

377
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,290
<i>She is not coming back.</i>

378
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,360
<i>There'll be only the two of us.</i>

379
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,008
<i>But remember, since there'll only be the two of us, man up!</i>

380
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,110
<i>Do not call your mom ever again.</i>

381
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,210
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

382
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,110
<i>No crying.</i>

383
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,676
<i>[Dear mom: I miss you!]</i>

384
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,188
Did she reply?

385
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,228
I've sent so many letters.

386
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:19,590
She didn't reply to me at all, not even one.

387
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,290
Why?

388
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,178
Did she really leave you?

389
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,330
She never received my letters.

390
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,384
Later, I realized that she passed away

391
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,560
when I was in junior high school.

392
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,460
It was cancer.

393
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,530
After my mom left, I was the only one left in the house.

394
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,990
At night, when I was doing my homework,

395
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,266
I saw a boy who was my age living across the building.

396
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,640
He was like me.

397
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,304
He always did his homework by the windowsill.

398
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,916
I saw his mom come out from the kitchen,

399
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,260
scolding him with a spatula in hand.

400
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,232
To be honest, I was jealous of him.

401
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,380
If my mom were here,

402
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,060
I'd be happy even if she scolded me all day.

403
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,320
Your mom would never scold you.

404
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,210
She would want you to be happy.

405
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,668
Well, I'm happy most of the time.

406
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,520
As long as my dad doesn't pick a fight. That's it.

407
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,140
Well, I think your father is used to being strict.

408
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,610
He doesn't know how to show his tenderness.

409
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,600
You too.

410
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,228
You don't talk about it, but you've been working so hard.

411
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,178
It's because you hope he'll be proud of you, right?

412
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,634
Maybe, a little?

413
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,950
Go fishing with him if you get the chance.

414
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,350
Forget it.

415
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,776
It's not like you don't know what my dad's level of fishing is.

416
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:31,350
After two hours of fishing, he still can't catch a single fish.

417
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,126
Do you want us to stare at each other?

418
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,550
Then put a bunch of fish in the pond.

419
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,250
I'm sure you'll catch at least one.

420
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,920
We've finished all the beers. That's quick.

421
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,590
I'll go get some beers.

422
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,910
Is the floor that slippery?

423
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,148
I'm feeling tipsy.

424
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,350
I think I'm calling it a day.

425
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,130
I'm feeling dizzy. I want to go back.

426
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,124
Why are you on my bed?

427
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,386
Wait! What's wrong with you?

428
00:30:58,386 --> 00:30:59,560
There's no empty room!

429
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,804
Where else can I go?

430
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:04,120
Come on, we've slept together before.

431
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,070
It's not like we haven't slept in the same bed before.

432
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,560
Are you out of your mind?

433
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,710
Don't you know I have mysophobia?

434
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,210
I don't.

435
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,800
When did you come back?

436
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,680
Why didn't I know?

437
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,220
I can't remember. I drank too much last night.

438
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,755
With that amount of beer, you and Ning Meng can be drunk?

439
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,450
Pack your things. We are going back to Shanghai.

440
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,240
Okay, it's done.

441
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,540
Morning.

442
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,940
Ning Meng, are you feeling okay?

443
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,740
Mr. Lu said he was black-out drunk.

444
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,031
I don't know. I was wasted.

445
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:37,010
My head still hurts a little. Check out, please. Okay.

446
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,540
I wonder how much you drank.

447
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,580
There were only six cans of beer when I left.

448
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,220
You can't hold your liquor at all.

449
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,570
We're done here. Let's go.

450
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,510
Let's go.

451
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,500
Let's go, Ning Meng. Come with us.

452
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,910
<i>[Cashier]</i>
It's okay, you can leave first. I'm taking the high-speed rail.

453
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,780
Come on, we are neighbors.

454
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,940
We can drop you. Let's go.

455
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,510
Let's take a group photo.

456
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,090
Group photo? How lame.

457
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,110
What's wrong with you?

458
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,336
Come on.

459
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:14,696
To memorize our first work trip, first hotel experience,

460
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,004
first drinking session.

461
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,970
Your first experience of taking care of the sick.

462
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,770
First...

463
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,650
What else?

464
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,460
I guess there are a lot of first-time experiences. Right?

465
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,120
Let's capture the moment.

466
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,160
Here. Here, one...

467
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,714
Come closer!

468
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,508
Here, one, two, three. First time!

469
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,310
<i>Why did you send me a photo?</i>

470
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,110
<i>It makes me feel like I'm checking in on you.</i>

471
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,370
<i>Let me know when you reach the city.</i>

472
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,770
Seriously. The destiny between two people is indeed destined.

473
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,230
Sometimes it is really arranged by God.

474
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,956
There are no amount of words that can equal a single touch.

475
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:08,050
That little feeling came up in one fell swoop,

476
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,470
and things worked out!

477
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,770
Can both of you talk?

478
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,886
I'm sleepy.

479
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,772
Mr. Lu,

480
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:29,360
Ms. Shi wants to call a meeting with you

481
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,610
to talk about the due diligence report.

482
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,386
What time works best for you?

483
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,410
Anytime next week.

484
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,782
Up to Ms. Shi.

485
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:41,470
Okay.

486
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,140
You come with me.

487
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,360
Why?

488
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,704
To learn.

489
00:34:47,704 --> 00:34:50,516
Fine, learn.

490
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:53,420
Lu Mingming, you kicked me off the bed this morning

491
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,180
and you asked what I was doing on your bed.

492
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,560
Who did you think I was?

493
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,334
I'm thinking there are only three of us.

494
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,050
Can you just keep your mouth shut for a moment?

495
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,360
Did you rent your mouth?

496
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
Would you waste your money if you don't use it?

I think it's nice.

Why did you turn it off?

505
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,400
I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

506
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,400
- Here, Ning Meng.
- Thanks, Mr. Zeng.

507
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,100
Don't mention it. We are neighbors.

508
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,040
Hello!

509
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,440
Here.

510
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,200
Ning Meng, you came back with them, too.

511
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,970
Why are you here?

512
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,220
Why can't I be here?

513
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,852
I'm not here for you.

514
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:28,446
I'm here for Hanghang.

515
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,700
Let me make the official announcement.

516
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,440
Moving forward, Tiantian belongs to me.

517
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,098
I knew it. Something was off when we were in Hangzhou.

518
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,610
It's great that you both are together.

519
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,220
One less problem for the marriageable age people.

520
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,802
When did this happen?

521
00:36:55,802 --> 00:37:00,094
Last time when we were at the RV park and you were so drunk.

522
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,932
Then both of us, accidentally, held hands.

523
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,350
Then...

524
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,658
Then we held each other's hands.

525
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:12,860
And we got together.

526
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,848
That's it?

527
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:17,080
Why make it complicated?

528
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,060
It's not love if you make it complicated. Right?

529
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,520
Exactly.

530
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,050
Mr. Zeng, you mentioned fate and physical contact just now.

531
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,700
Were you talking about you both?

532
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,260
Of course! I can't be talking about you guys, right?

533
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,520
Let's go. Let's eat.

534
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,430
- I bought you a lot of food.
- Let's go. Let's go.

535
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,740
- Let's go.
- Bye.

536
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,400
See you. Bye.

537
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,400
- Well...
- I...

538
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,630
Let me know beforehand after Ms. Shi Ying decides the meeting's details.

539
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,538
Okay, bye.

540
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,280
Hi.

541
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,080
<i>Mengmeng!</i>

542
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,940
<i>It's confirmed that He is going to Shanghai.</i>

543
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,260
Which company is he going to?

544
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,460
<i>An insurance company.</i>

545
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,932
<i>He's the head of the Shanghai branch.</i>

546
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,654
Does it mean that you are coming, too?

547
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:59,460
<i>Yes, get ready to welcome me.</i>

548
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,530
When are you coming?

549
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,546
<i>I'm not sure about the details, but I guess it will happen soon.</i>

550
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:06,842
All right! I'll pick you up.

551
00:39:06,842 --> 00:39:08,700
Finally!

552
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,324
<i>I know! I miss you so much!</i>

553
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,852
<i>Mengmeng, how was your business trip?</i>

554
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,290
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

555
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,010
Well, it is...

556
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,650
But...

557
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,156
I have a question.

558
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,910
Okay, what is it?

559
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,770
I... One of my friends... My friend...

560
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,230
She... She and her male colleague

561
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,260
were drunk and they touched each other accidentally.

562
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,648
Their faces touched.

563
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,800
Then she told me the incident kept

564
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,800
<i>coming into her mind.</i>

565
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:50,570
<i>Well, I don't know how to deal with this.</i>

566
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,050
<i>I don't have experience.</i>

567
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,900
<i>How about you analyze the situation for her?</i>

568
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,100
What do you mean? What do you mean by their faces touched?

569
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,120
It's considered a "bump" if she knocked him in the forehead.

570
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,980
It's considered a "touch" if she kissed him.

571
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,780
Make it clear.

572
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,171
<i>Kissed. They kissed.</i>

573
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:14,460
Mengmeng, it's another person's matter, but why are you blushing?

574
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,380
I'm not blushing.

575
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,290
I'm hot. I just got home. I'm hot.

576
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,256
Hello?

577
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,770
The connection is bad here.

578
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,830
I'll switch to audio.

579
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,410
Please continue.

580
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,330
Okay.

581
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,574
After listening to what you said, I guess she likes that guy.

582
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,478
<i>If they kissed</i>

583
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,792
<i>and she didn't show disgust or was uncomfortable;</i>

584
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,836
<i>furthermore, if she recalls that moment,</i>

585
00:40:46,836 --> 00:40:48,370
I'm sure she has feelings for him.

586
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,702
No, that's impossible.

587
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:54,420
Mengmeng, why do I feel like you are making this "friend" up?

588
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,681
<i>Is this "friend" yourself?</i>

589
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,240
<i>Tell me!</i>

590
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,720
What happened?

591
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,372
Nothing.

592
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,460
I told you that it wasn't me.

593
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,432
It's my friend.

594
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:07,981
I'm never going to ask this kind of question on behalf of others again.

595
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:10,250
That's embarrassing.

596
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,560
All right. I get it now.

597
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,460
I'll tell my friend about your thoughts. Bye!

598
