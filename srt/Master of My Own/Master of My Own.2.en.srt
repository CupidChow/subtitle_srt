<i>[Master Of My Own]</i>

2
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,890
My surname is Ning. But you can call me Ning Meng.

3
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,550
I think money is something that you have to treat with respect.
<i>[Three Years Ago]</i>

4
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,450
It's not something superficial. Instead, it's quite noble.

5
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,720
The thing that matters is how we spend the money to maximize its value.

6
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,490
A career in investment can better help me spend my money on something worthy.

7
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,950
And that drives me to work harder.

8
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,083
Mr. Liu?

9
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,413
What's wrong?

10
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,510
Mr. Lu is on an international call. He needs a secretary to take notes for him.

11
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,690
The last one was fired, right?

12
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,450
Mr. Lu is furious now.

13
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,470
Go through the interviewees for today.

14
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,770
Find out who has passed TEM-8.

15
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,900
You too.

16
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Hurry up.

17
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,003
She can do it.

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,820
Hurry up. Let's go.

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,900
<i>With the massive market, its talents pool,</i>

20
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,470
<i>and highly efficient capital market, we believe that China</i>

21
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>is absolutely the right choice.</i>

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,543
Great.

23
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,220
I look forward to our collaboration.

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,170
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

25
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,600
Sure. Goodbye.

26
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,830
Have you noted down everything?

27
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,563
Almost.

28
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,810
He has such a heavy Southeast Asian accent, but you managed to note down everything.

29
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,110
I noted them down by sections.

30
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,720
The core is made up of three sections.

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,570
Internet, AI, and global+ trends.

32
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,130
You are quite smart.

33
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,760
What is your name?

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,333
Ning Meng.

35
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,570
- As a secretary?
- Yes.

36
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,060
You were chosen by Mr. Lu.

37
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,020
Mr. Liu, today is April Fool's Day.

38
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,630
Are you joking with me?

39
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,263
Ning, don't underestimate this position.

40
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:35,880
Mr. Lu has high standards.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,730
Not everyone can work as his secretary.

42
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,050
Before you, no one could handle the position.

43
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,730
You are the first one who was chosen by Mr. Lu.

44
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,420
But I applied for the Project Department.

45
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,370
Don't be so block-headed.

46
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,910
This is a once in a blue moon opportunity for you.

47
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,561
Have you seen any newbies who worked straight with the number one on the first day of work?

48
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,320
Those newbies will just start with the basics.

49
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,253
- But you'll be learning from the best.
- Yes.

50
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:03,390
I understand your concern.

51
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,390
After you enter the company, you can still change your position.

52
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,210
I've already come to an agreement with Mr. Lu.

53
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,250
When we find a more suitable candidate,

54
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,570
we'll transfer you to the Project Department right away.

55
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,000
What if you can't find a suitable candidate?

56
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,230
Three years maximum.

57
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,770
After three years, I can be transferred to another position no matter what?

58
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,090
Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu. Have you found a new secretary?

59
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,440
It's too soon. Don't be anxious.

60
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,970
You should gain more experience first.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,270
Wu, I need to talk to you.

62
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,900
This is not the right attitude.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,760
Mr. Liu, it has been more than a year.

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,220
You haven't found a suitable secretary to take over?

65
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,670
It's not that easy to find the perfect secretary.

66
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,250
Hang in there, Ning. I'm already working on it.

67
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,003
If...

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,060
I think I remember someone. Take this.

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,893
Let me think.

70
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,143
Bye, Mr. Liu.

71
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,523
Mr. Liu.

72
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,230
About my transfer.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,070
I'm still looking for a suitable candidate, Ning Meng.

74
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,620
You've already survived for two years.

75
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,720
Wait a little longer. It'll be soon.

76
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,030
- Mr. Liu.
- The elevator is here.

77
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,220
- Hu.
- Mr. Liu.

78
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,290
Let's go.

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,840
<i>We agreed to three years.</i>

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
<i>Now, you want me to work for three more years?</i>

81
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,293
<i>Mr. Liu.</i>

82
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,780
<i>I didn't get to choose in the past.</i>

83
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,510
<i>Now, I want to be an investor!</i>

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,943
<i>Sure.</i>

85
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,440
<i>Tell Mr. Lu about it.</i>

86
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,090
<i>Let's see if he'll give you that chance or not!</i>

87
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:57,692
<i>[Episode 2]</i>

88
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,175
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

89
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,450
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

90
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,943
<i>Mr. Liu.</i>

91
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,200
- What are you looking at?
- Mr. Liu.

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,610
Come on, let's talk.

93
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,400
Ms. Ning, you are such a prestigious person.

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,270
Mr. Lu called me at three in the morning and asked me to prepare the contract for your renewal.

95
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,820
Three in the morning.

96
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,670
I didn't sleep at all after that.

97
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,010
Let me tell you. Look at this industry.

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,230
How many bosses think so highly of their secretaries?

99
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,880
You need to cherish this blessing of having a boss like Mr. Lu.

100
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,210
After you renew your contract, not only will your salary go up two grades,

101
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,550
but Mr. Lu has also taken the initiative to grant you an annual leave which is unprecedented.

102
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,040
Ten days.

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,680
Even I am envious of you.

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,793
Mr. Liu.

105
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:15,670
I already told you before this that my target is the Project Department.

106
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,700
On the first of April three years ago, you sat over there and I sat over here.

107
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,950
You personally promised me that this position as a secretary was just temporary.

108
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,300
Are three years not enough?

109
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,950
Do I have to continue for three more years?

110
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,280
Ning, about this...

111
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,320
You can blame me for it.

112
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,910
But you know about his temper, too.

113
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,443
How about this?

114
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's think about it in the long run, right?

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,050
You just want to be transferred, right?

116
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,180
Let's use our time in exchange for an opening.

117
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,780
You've repeated the same thing too many times.

118
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,713
Ning.

119
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,410
Can't you be our savior?

120
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,220
Stop making a fuss about this.

121
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,470
Mr. Lu will lose his temper at any time.

122
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,820
Everyone in the company

123
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,610
is terrified of him.

124
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,110
You are different.

125
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,260
You can even withstand a missile.

126
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,580
Let me tell you. Like this.

127
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,660
Take this contract for your renewal with you first.

128
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,910
No need to reject my offer so quickly.

129
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,640
Think about it. Don't rush it.

130
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,223
Ning Meng.

131
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,280
Meng, come.

132
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,250
I heard that because of you, Mr. Lu called Mr. Liu in the middle of the night.

133
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,560
How did you make our two bosses lose sleep because of you?

134
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,640
Do you want me to give this fortune to you then?

135
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,790
I wouldn't dare to accept it.

136
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,080
Meng, I just happened to hear it when I passed by just now.

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
I didn't eavesdrop on purpose.

138
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,310
I heard that Mr. Liu is going to give you a 10-day annual leave. Is it true?

139
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,070
The 10-day leave is real.

140
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,310
But only if Mr. Lu can make do with me.

141
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,370
Even a 10-hour-leave is already a luxury. Let alone 10 days.

142
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,900
What are you going to do then? Aren't you going to renew your contract?

143
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,690
I still want to get a job transfer.

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,540
I need to talk to Mr. Lu about it again.

145
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,273
Ms. Xu.

146
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,250
The life of this princess is indeed different from ours.

147
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,840
I just saw that dress on a fashion public account yesterday.

148
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,190
And she's already wearing it today.

149
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,910
- Good day, Ms. Xu.
- Good day, Ms. Xu.

150
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,320
She's here to pester Mr. Lu again.

151
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,920
Meng, we'll have to step away for now.

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,433
Okay.

153
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:14,240
Deliver it to me after you sign it. That's it.

154
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,150
Mingming.

155
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,210
Why are you here?

156
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,480
Can't I be here?

157
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,150
Are you using perfume as body shampoo?

158
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,850
The smell is choking me.

159
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't be like that.

160
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,200
This is a customized perfume from Creed.

161
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,710
It has woody and floral notes to it.

162
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,480
- First, you'll get the smell of Iris.
- Stop.

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,840
- Then...
- I'm not interested in any of that.

164
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,730
Another thing. If it's not something important, don't always come to my company.

165
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,590
Who says I'm not here for something important?

166
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm here today to introduce an important guest to you.

167
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,150
Shi Ying.

168
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,600
Shi Ying from Eaglestone Capital?

169
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,780
- You met each other at the award ceremony yesterday, right?
- Yes.

170
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,890
She and I studied for the Executive Master of Business Administration together. We are close.

171
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,280
I'm sure you know how capable she is.

172
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,650
Yes. She's quite capable.

173
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,900
From a Sponsor Representative to an investor. And she managed to build her company in a few short years. She's not bad.

174
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,480
So, I brought her with me to see if there are any chances for you to collaborate in the future.

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,350
If you really become partners, you have to thank me.

176
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,430
It'll be good if we can collaborate.

177
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,980
Thank you in advance then, Ms. Xu.

178
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,750
You are welcome.

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,240
What time will Ms. Shi be here?

180
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,080
Around 20 to 30 minutes. There's a traffic jam.

181
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,470
You always do sneak attacks.

182
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,500
Mingming, I saw an internet-famous cafe that day.

183
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,370
Its interior design is so cute. Look.

184
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,620
- There's a panda...
- Ning Meng, come to my office.

185
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,830
- Mr. Lu.
- Please go down to escort Ms. Shi up.

186
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,330
Ms. Shi from Eaglestone Capital. Do you know her?

187
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,140
She's still stuck in the traffic jam, right? Why did you ask her to go down now?

188
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,890
Go and clean up the conference room then. We'll use it for briefing later.

189
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,310
Am I right, Mingming?

190
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,580
Why are you still standing there? Go now.

191
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,090
Hey. You don't even hesitate to order my employee around.

192
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,583
Well...

193
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,570
We are so close. What is yours is mine.

194
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,390
Don't simply touch me.

195
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,420
Don't cross the line.

196
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,750
Good day, Ms. Shi. I am Mr. Lu's secretary, Ning Meng.

197
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,740
So, you are Mr. Lu's secretary?

198
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,240
Thank you for yesterday.

199
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,150
You are welcome. This way, please.

200
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,040
I watched your interview before.

201
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,510
You taught us a lot of new concepts from the perspective of a female investor.

202
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,550
Especially the part about the industrial mindset.

203
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,250
It was so interesting.

204
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,030
Thank you. You are quite attentive.

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,350
What did you study?

206
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,380
Finance.

207
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,473
Not bad.

208
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,590
This way, please.

209
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,580
I'm more interested in new retailing as well as technology and lifestyle projects.

210
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,370
So, I'm here today to hear about your investment framework.

211
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,700
Let's see if we can collaborate.

212
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,710
Ms. Shi, you are too humble.

213
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,280
I have some projects with good potential, too.

214
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,220
I would like to hear about your suggestions about them.

215
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,980
I'm sure you don't need my suggestions, but I'm quite interested in those projects.

216
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,280
Ning Meng, bring Ren Pengfei and Qiu Junlin here.

217
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,900
Ask them to introduce the projects to Ms. Shi.

218
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,540
Mr. Lu, Mr. Ren and Mr. Qiu are having a meeting outside right now.

219
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,590
They'll only be back in the afternoon.

220
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,660
Ren Pengfei does need to attend a meeting.

221
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,360
What about Qiu Junlin? What is he doing?

222
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,860
How about I give him a call?

223
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,040
Shi Ying's time is precious.

224
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,660
Mr. Lu, how about letting me do the briefing?

225
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,570
Isn't there anyone else in the Project Department?

226
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,360
How can you let a secretary do the briefing?

227
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,550
Ms. Xu, I'll go through each and every one of the company's projects.

228
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,940
I know the progress, process, and non-disclosure agreement of every project.

229
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,510
It's okay. I'm here today just to find out about the overall investments.

230
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,200
You can do the briefing then, Ms. Ning.

231
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,083
Do it then.

232
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,473
Ms. Shi, let me first tell you about the strong points of our company's strategy.

233
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:54,970
The goal of our company is not only about investing in a profitable business.

234
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,940
We also hope that we can shape our future lifestyle through the creativity of the people.

235
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,230
That's not important information.

236
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,230
Tell her something specific about the projects.

237
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,953
Okay.

238
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:11,250
Let me talk about our latest project then. Kirin's Furniture.

239
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,590
Its main concept is to build an environmentally friendly home.

240
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,320
Environmentally friendly home?

241
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,900
Kirin's Furniture has a unique concept.

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,000
Wood is a living thing.

243
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,005
Through sustainable felling, the low-carbon production process,

244
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:30,935
and the advantage of being easy to recycle and reuse, we'll maximize the preservation of the original wood.

245
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:32,955
It also reflects the concept of even being eco-friendly.

246
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:38,445
We can showcase the value of traditional handicrafts through modern design.

247
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:40,970
As the angel investor, Joint Capital is now helping the corporation

248
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,205
to proceed into the venture capital stage.

249
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:47,425
So, now is the best time for you to put in your investment.

250
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:53,525
<i>[Project Report on Kirin's Furniture]</i>
This is the main project of Joint Capital now.

251
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:57,415
Mr. Lu, Ms. Ning has done a professional briefing.

252
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,910
From the features of the product to business logic,

253
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,260
she has explained them very clearly.

254
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,065
You have a hidden talent here.

255
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,565
You are too kind, Ms. Shi.

256
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,515
Ning Meng, hurry up and fill up our cups.

257
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,805
Ms. Ning, you are very observant.

258
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,955
How did you find out?

259
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,805
Although a right-hander will sometimes use their left hand,

260
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:37,765
I saw you using your left hand to take your phone and bag and make hand gestures.

261
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,555
So, I thought you were a left-hander.

262
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,685
You have a bright mind and you are meticulous.

263
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,135
You have the talent to take on a project.

264
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:51,778
Ms. Shi, she and money don't go together.

265
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,235
According to you, our company has many hidden talents.

266
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,305
We don't need her.

267
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:57,335
Yes.

268
00:17:57,335 --> 00:18:01,575
Everyone in the Joint Capital graduated from top universities.

269
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:03,965
But I really think that she's a talent.

270
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:07,875
Mr. Lu, you should consider grooming her to become a great investor.

271
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,195
- Are you trying to steal my employee?
- Of course not.

272
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:13,995
Mr. Lu, how can she be that important?

273
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:16,095
If you lose her, I can take her place.

274
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,065
I wouldn't dare to trouble you to do these menial chores, Ms. Xu.

275
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,088
I can't see you pouring drinks for others.

276
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:42,965
Ms. Shi, the new samples of Kirin's Furniture will be out next week.

277
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:45,455
When the time comes, we can take a look at them together.

278
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,975
Make sure to contact me at once.

279
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,095
I really can't wait to collaborate with you.

280
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,025
Me too.

281
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,705
If you manage to collaborate, don't forget about me.

282
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:53,805
Make sure to treat me to a feast.

283
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:55,738
Of course.

284
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,935
Do you hear that, Mingming?

285
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,315
Okay, I promise you.

286
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:04,065
Okay. Farewell, Ms. Shi.

287
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:23,988
Come in.

288
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:28,455
Mr. Lu.

289
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:30,405
I didn't ask you to come in, right?

290
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,995
- It's about my transfer. I want to...
- The benefits that I'm giving you

291
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:37,495
are already the best compared to the others in the same position.

292
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:41,245
If there's anything that you are not satisfied with, you better make sure that you have the capabilities to match.

293
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:44,385
Or else, I don't have the time to listen to you crying for the moon.

294
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,205
I'm very thankful to you for the increment and benefits.

295
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:53,095
But I haven't even given it a try. How can you say that I'm crying for the moon?

296
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:57,185
You know who Zhao Kuo of the Warring States period is, right?

297
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,335
It's such an easy idiom.

298
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:01,215
You just have to say that it's just empty talk.

299
00:20:01,215 --> 00:20:03,065
No need to use an allusion.

300
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,925
You did well for the briefing.

301
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:10,705
But handling a project and doing a briefing are two different things.

302
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:14,205
The capabilities that you had shown me could not convince me. Understand?

303
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:19,275
But if I just make coffee every day, then I can only show you my capabilities in making coffee.

304
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:26,738
Come in.

305
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,135
Mr. Lu, I heard that you were looking for me just now.

306
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:34,845
You know that, too? I was looking for you just now.

307
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:37,135
What's the point of being here right now?

308
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,468
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:42,925
When I didn't want to see you in the past, you were always around.

310
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,445
But when I need you, I can't find any of you.

311
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:47,995
In the end, a secretary had to do the briefing.

312
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:51,085
Others will think that our company is just a joke.

313
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,635
Do you know that?

314
00:20:52,635 --> 00:20:55,605
- This morning, I went...
- Shut up.

315
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:58,355
You can't even give me a good reason. Stop stuttering.

316
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:05,755
I'm talking to you. Why are you looking at her?

317
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,685
Enough. No need to say anything more. Get out.

318
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,185

Why didn't you save me today?

Why is he mocking you again?

We just help them out of our kindness, but we don't have to.

This has nothing to do with him.

342
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,755
Is it because Mr. Lu refused to transfer you?

343
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,805
Meng, I support you in making the switch.

Let me tell you.

This is a rechargeable battery.

462

For a normal battery, it can't be used anymore once it runs out of energy.

463
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:16,915
But for this rechargeable battery, after it runs out of energy,

you can reuse it after you charge it.

Mr. Lu, I've thought about it carefully.

00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,545
I still want to get a job transfer.

We've already closed the topic, right?

- Over the past...
- Ning Meng, when have you become so ambitious?

551
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:52,765
You are such a dreamer.

552
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,995
When you started your company,

553
00:38:56,995 --> 00:39:00,475
what would you think if someone told you the same thing back then?

554
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:04,265
I think no one said that to me.

555
00:39:07,785 --> 00:39:10,265
It has been three years. It's not a short time.

556
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,645
Back then, I was just a temporary secretary.

557
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:16,125
Why don't you find a more suitable secretary?

558
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:19,165
You are that secretary.

559
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:23,155
You have to know your worth.

560
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:26,685
You need to know where you stand. Understand?

561
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:29,785
Now, you have two choices.

562
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:34,105
You can be my secretary or you don't do anything at all.

563
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,445
You can go back now. Coffee.

564
00:39:52,465 --> 00:39:53,925
I quit.

565
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,225
Thank you for the past three years.

566

- Mr. Zeng.
