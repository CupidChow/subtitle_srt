00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,439
(Episode 4)

2
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,640
We're here.

3
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
The fare is 445 yuan.

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,079
Please pay with your phone.

5
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,199
Okay.

6
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,879
- It's pretty far out. - Yes.

7
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,919
All right, it has been paid.

8
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,120
Okay. Thank you.

9
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,530
Ms. Ning.

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,039
Ms. Ning, right?

11
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,199
- Mr. Zhang? Hello. - Hello. It's me.

12
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,479
- I'll show you around. - Okay.

13
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,680
This way, please.

14
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,120
We have 15 acres of land here.

15
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,530
That's more than 10,000 square feet.

16
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,719
To your left are ten caravans.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,039
This side is the space capsules,

18
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,199
helicopters, and trains.

19
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,680
They're all model-themed rooms.

20
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,759
This is a small square.

21
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,879
There's a stage.

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
It's very suitable for roadshows,

23
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,680
bonfire parties,

24
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,280
and small group building activities.

25
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,520
Many influencers come to check in here.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,639
Our place is very popular online.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
This way. I'll show you the RV.

28
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,919
This is the biggest RV in our camp currently.

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,439
Take a look.

30
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,159
This is the leisure area.

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,199
This is the kitchen.

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,439
By the way, this is everything you asked me to prepare.

33
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,879
- They're all here, right? - Yes.

34
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,360
- Okay. - Get some rest.

35
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,680
Call me if you need anything.

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Of course. Go ahead.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,879
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

38
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,759
The value of eco-friendly industry is expected to grow...

39
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,199
by 11.07 percent over the next five years.

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,479
It's a very competitive track.

41
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,240
The eco-friendliness of a product...

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,919
will be a more important factor in the future.

43
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,039
Our company has previous experience.

44
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,439
The advantages are very obvious.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,800
That's not an advantage.

46
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,680
The gaps in environmental industries and the applications are large.

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,919
One successful investment can turn the table around.

48
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,960
Everyone should pay more attention to companies...

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,159
that are not large in volume but have excellent technology,

50
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,560
yet cannot raise capital.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Their future...

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
might be even more valuable.

53
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,400
What are you doing?

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,159
What Mr. Lu said was so insightful.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
Why aren't there any reactions?

56
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,039
Applause.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,879
Stop.

58
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
That's right. That's how it should be.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,000
Xiao Yang.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Go over the recording later.

61
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,519
Pick out Mr. Lu's words...

62
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,560
to be used as our internal investment guidebook.

63
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,399
I even organized Mr. Lu's previous interviews.

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
Put them all together and send them out to everyone.

65
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
Remember to share it on social media.

66
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,000
Why are you doing all this?

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,639
All right, the meeting is adjourned. Dismissed.

68
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,730
Ming Ming, are you tired? I'll give you a massage.

69
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,800
I'm not tired, thank you.

70
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,839
Are you hungry? I'll get you something to eat.

71
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,050
Xu Si Tian.

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,279
Can you not put the focus of your work...

73
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,639
on me?

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
But I'm your secretary.

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,610
It's my job to focus on you.

76
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,079
You've said so much. You must be thirsty.

77
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
I'll make you some coffee.

78
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,050
I just bought some Geisha coffee beans.

79
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,399
Wait for me.

80
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,319
Mr. Lu.

81
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,480
Do I need to organize the recording?

82
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,610
- What for? - Joint Capital...

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,730
is only a five-year company.

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
To have received such an award...

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,839
What's playing?

86
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,759
It's the PR clip for Joint Capital.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,839
Who asked to?

88
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:29,839
- Ms. Xu. - I personally think...

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,279
investment is about the art of people.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
- I especially like... - Hello, Mr. Lu.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
- Hello, Mr. Lu. - Hello, Mr. Lu.

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
this one Chinese character...

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,319
Turn it off now!

94
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,959
Hui, turn it off. Hurry!

95
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,519
- Okay. - Two people standing side...

96
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,720
Don't ever do this again. Got it?

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,560
Don't do these things anymore.

98
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,160
Ning Meng has gone to do due diligence.

99
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,959
Why are you telling me that?

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
Did I ask?

101
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,519
Which project?

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,439
Which project did she go to do her due diligence on?

103
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,839
Ms. Xu's RV camp project.

104
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Hi. Excuse me.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,279
I'd like to interview you.

106
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,000
Today's shoot went well.

107
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,399
You can take these samples.

108
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,279
We can make some good clips with them.

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,720
Are you leaving already?

111
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,759
That's right.

112
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,879
Aren't you spending the night here?

113
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
It's too expensive. We usually go home after work.

114
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,600
Can I ask if there's anywhere to visit...

115
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
in the daytime?

116
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
In the daytime?

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,279
Do you know any fun places?

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,199
During the day,

119
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,720
there's not much to do here.

120
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,480
You can drive out further,

121
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,439
but there's only the scenery to look at.

122
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
- All right. Thank you. - Okay, we'll get going.

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,839
- Bye. - Bye.

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
Ning Meng.

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,399
You're finally back.

126
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,839
What's the matter?

127
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,039
Ms. Xu is acting as Mr. Lu's secretary.

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,679
I have to be her worker.

129
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,559
I get scolded twice a day.

130
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm so annoyed!

131
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,639
Enough. Keep it down. Don't let anyone hear you.

132
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,840
So? How was the RV camp?

133
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,559
I went there to do due diligence, not having fun.

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Hello, Ms. Xu.

135
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,559
Were you talking about the RV camp?

136
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,559
Did you go to do due diligence?

137
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,879
Mr. Qiu asked me to go...

138
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,090
When I meet him later, I'll explain the details...

139
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,120
Qiu Jun Lin.

140
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,600
Ms. Xu. What brings you here?

141
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
Let me ask you.

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,480
Who was sent to research the RV camp project?

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,960
Ning Meng.

144
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,090
What do you mean by that?

145
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,090
Are you looking down on my project?

146
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,639
How could you send her?

147
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't be angry. Come.

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,450
Here, have a seat.

149
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,559
The thing is,

150
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,720
no one is looking down on your project.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
Ning Meng has followed Mr. Lu for so many years.

152
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,720
Mr. Lu values her too.

153
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,919
So I thought I could leave your project with her.

154
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,679
Are you mad?

155
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,399
Mr. Lu only values her as a secretary.

156
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,039
What does it have to do with her doing projects?

157
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,480
Don't be angry.

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,759
How about this?

159
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,159
She should be back by now.

160
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's get her here.

161
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,159
Ning Meng.

162
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,210
Ning Meng.

163
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,720
Ms. Xu is here.

164
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Come.

165
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,039
Ms. Xu.

166
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,210
Ning Meng.

167
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,399
When you went to do due diligence,

168
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,450
did I tell you...

169
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,159
to get this project done the best you could?

170
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,639
Look. I've told her to do her best.

171
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,090
Does she know what due diligence is?

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Can you do it?

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,159
You think you can jump to heaven on a trampoline.

174
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,159
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

175
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,399
I'll make sure to come up with a satisfactory report.

176
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,759
Did you hear that?

177
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,450
We'll definitely give you a result that you are satisfied with.

178
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,090
Take care, Ms. Xu.

179
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,879
This woman...

180
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Mr. Qiu.

181
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,399
It's okay.

182
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,559
I have a conference call soon.

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,559
Thank you. You can go now.

184
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,600
Just because Ning Meng still share your halo light,

185
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,279
that dumb Qiu Jun Lin...

186
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,200
let her get involved in such an important project.

187
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,759
I'm so mad!

188
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,840
Xu Si Tian.

189
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Can you give me a break?

190
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,159
You walking back and forth...

191
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,559
is giving me a headache.

192
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm angry. I can't sit still.

193
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
You can't sit still?

194
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,559
Then why don't you take a walk? It's so nice out.

195
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,960
You always take me for your emotional trash can...

196
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,759
and pour everything on me.

197
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you here to be my secretary...

198
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,240
or my ancestor?

199
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm just worried about this project.

200
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
It's very important to me.

201
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,360
You didn't even read the report.

202
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
What are you worried about?

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,399
What do you mean by that, Lu Ji Ming?

204
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you taking her side?

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,399
Xu Si Tian.

206
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,440
Can you not be such a baby?

207
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,759
You're not young anymore.

208
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,440
Then what should we do about this?

209
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,200
Do what we have to do.

210
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,279
We'll find out at the meeting.

211
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,840
First, you have to go through...

212
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,039
the report.

213
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,639
What's there to see with the report she wrote?

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
She just wrote some data...

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,440
just as a formality or something.

216
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,039
We'll wait at the meeting then.

217
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,879
My project is so good. I'm not afraid.

218
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,320
- Tian Tian. - What?

219
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,399
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

220
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,600
You gave me a headache.

221
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,159
I'm not in the mood. Find someone else.

222
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,480
Who...

223
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Ning Meng, are you all right?

224
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,720
Don't cry over something like this.

225
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,960
It's not worth it.

226
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm not crying.

227
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,679
That's good then.

228
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,159
Don't misunderstand, Ning Meng.

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

230
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,600
The previous projects Ms. Xu sent over...

231
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,080
didn't turn out well.

232
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,080
So I didn't tell you...

233
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,279
because I didn't want you to be biased.

234
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,399
It's okay.

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,519
No matter whose project it is,

236
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
I'll be objective about it.

237
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,279
Well said, Ning Meng.

238
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,120
You're capable and willing.

239
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,519
You'll make it.

240
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,480
If they don't believe in you, I will.

241
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you, Ms. Feng.

242
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
Right. Mr. Qiu mentioned just now...

243
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
that you will be the speaker of the meeting.

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Me?

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,759
But I don't have much experience.

246
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,720
Doesn't experience build up over time?

247
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,000
I was there once.

248
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,799
And you need to take the chance to show yourself off.

249
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,559
Two months will pass very quickly.

250
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,919
Will you just...

251
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,279
let it go?

252
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,600
I also have some research reports on the RV industry...

253
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,759
from several consulting firms.

254
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,840
I'll e-mail them to you later. Look into them.

255
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,159
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Feng.

256
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,720
Don't mention it. Keep it up.

257
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,279
Keep it up.

258
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
Distinguished leaders,

259
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,879
I'm Ning Meng.

260
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,600
I'll take it from here...

261
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,639
to report to everyone...

262
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,519
the due diligence report...

263
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,840
of the RV camp project.

264
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
Please look at the screen.

265
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,320
First, customer traffic.

266
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,519
Second, revenue.

267
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,360
First, the issue with revenue.

268
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,840
Second, the issue with customer traffic.

269
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,440
No, it's too messy.

270
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,480
It's far...

271
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,919
from the key scenic spots...

272
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,720
and is located on the outskirts of the city.

273
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,000
All these situations affect...

274
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,080
It affects the growth of passenger traffic.

275
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,159
According to the data,

276
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,320
the occupancy rate is 50 percent.

277
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,720
But this is not the case.

278
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,240
Did I ask? Shut up.

279
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,399
I've interviewed some tourists.

280
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,399
The negative comments are divided into two types.

281
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,600
Do you want to do it?

282
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,919
You do it. You report it.

283
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,879
I'll hit you.

284
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,559
That's all.

285
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,080
Does anyone have any questions?

286
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,679
Okay, thank you.

287
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,440
Hello.

288
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,480
Ning Meng, you finally picked up.

289
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,919
The meeting will begin soon. Where are you?

290
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm coming.

291
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,919
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
You're still half-asleep,

293
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,919
but your body is quite honest.

294
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,000
You're doing projects and secretarial work at the same time.

295
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,679
Is working two jobs too much pressure?

296
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Are you tired?

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,039
Will you do the report or not?

298
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,079
Ning Meng, everyone already has a copy.

299
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,759
Hurry up and report it.

300
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,039
I'll begin.

301
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,359
You're looking at...

302
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,000
the due diligence report for the RV camp project.

303
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,960
For this project,

304
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,319
the main concern is customer traffic...

305
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:57,319
and sales revenue.

306
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,279
I think the core of the problem...

307
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,279
is due to the location.

308
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,119
It's located on the city's outskirts...

309
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,410
and is far from major attractions.

310
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,240
It lacks the cluster effect.

311
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,650
It's far from the main road and is hard to reach.

312
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,410
These situations...

313
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,119
limit the number of customers.

314
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,039
According to the promotional materials,

315
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,799
the occupancy rate is 50 percent.

316
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,079
But that's not the case.

317
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,200
What are you talking about?

318
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,680
This RV camp...

319
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,319
is very popular online.

320
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,359
Many influencers check in there.

321
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you think the customer traffic can't be increased?

322
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,680
Ms. Xu, whether online popularity...

323
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,319
can be converted into actual revenue...

324
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,319
is questionable.

325
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,079
I've done a field study.

326
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,170
The RV camp is beautiful indeed.

327
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,759
But most people just go to take pictures.

328
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,960
They go back right after that.

329
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,519
I interviewed some tourists...

330
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
and gathered some comments online.

331
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,920
Negative comments are divided into two types.

332
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,839
First, the price of accommodation is too high.

333
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,200
Second,

334
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,079
people are not used...

335
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,599
to RV accommodation.

336
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,240
There is insufficient development and recreation at the camp.

337
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,650
Aren't those the problems we're going to solve?

338
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,079
It's easy for you to stand there and nitpick.

339
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,119
What's the point?

340
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
Ms. Xu, what I've done is the due diligence report.

341
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,599
The strengths and weaknesses of the project...

342
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,440
are based on objective facts.

343
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
RV culture is, after all, an imported product.

344
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,680
It's the reality that the locals are not used to it.

345
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,079
Until those problems are resolved,

346
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,240
I think we should be cautious.

347
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,799
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.

348
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Is this project worth investing in?

349
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,079
It's too risky.

350
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,599
I wouldn't recommend it.

351
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,599
What do you mean by that?

352
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,319
I worked so hard on this project.

353
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,079
Yet you dismissed it in a few words.

354
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,279
Who do you think you are, Ning Meng?

355
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,799
You're a secretary who joined the project department.

356
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,170
Do you really think you're something?

357
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,319
No.

358
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,359
Ms. Xu.

359
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,680
My due diligence report...

360
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,440
is an objective judgment based on facts.

361
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,920
Yes, it's very important to be objective.

362
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,000
It's Ning Meng's first time doing a due diligence report.

363
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,000
She might be lacking in some ways.

364
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,170
Please forgive her, Ms. Xu.

365
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,759
Don't be mad.

366
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
Ning Meng, here is the thing.

367
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,440
Personally,

368
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,559
I think what you're saying is one-sided.

369
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,559
How many days have you researched it?

370
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,000
There's a huge difference in the number of customers...

371
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,000
on weekdays and weekends.

372
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,960
There are off-seasons and peak seasons as well.

373
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,799
Besides, there are also...

374
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,119
national holidays.

375
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,890
Have you considered those?

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,799
Mr. Qiu, though the research was only for a few days,

377
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,480
I believe the data is compelling.

378
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,200
You can't be sure about that.

379
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,519
It was only for a few days.

380
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
How much data can you get?

381
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,079
I've calculated the vacancy rate and revenue for each day...

382
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,650
the RV campground has been opened,

383
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,799
as well as the thousands of small-ticket stubs.

384
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Ning Meng.

385
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,890
I'm not questioning...

386
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,519
your ability in statistics.

387
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm trying to say...

388
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
that you can't keep your eyes on the past.

389
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,319
Everyone knows that...

390
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,759
everywhere is doing ecotourism.

391
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,599
Their goal is to improve the local economy.

392
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,359
From what I know, the area this RV camp is located...

393
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,519
will receive certain support and subsidies in the future.

394
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,410
Am I right, Ms. Xu?

395
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,000
That's right. You're well informed.

396
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,890
It hasn't been announced yet.

397
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,410
There are people who don't know.

398
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,200
Ning Meng.

399
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,640
Do you have anything else to add?

400
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
No.

401
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,359
Mr. Lu, how about this?

402
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,319
Division Two will schedule another round of due diligence...

403
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:10,400
for a more accurate assessment.

404
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
Is that okay?

405
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
You make the arrangements.

406
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,880
That's it for today's meeting.

407
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,240
Meeting adjourned.

408
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,240
You can't even handle something so simple.

409
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,680
You're only suited to be a secretary indeed.

410
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,119
I knew that would happen.

411
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,559
That scene was so bad.

412
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,039
Her face was all blue.

413
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,079
Good thing they didn't throw the hot potato at us.

414
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,279
It's all thanks to Mr. Qiu.

415
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,000
That's right.

416
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
Mr. Qiu's trick is incredible.

417
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,680
But that girl is quite unlucky.

418
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,599
Yes, quite unlucky.

419
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Why don't you do it instead?

420
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,920
Never mind.

421
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,000
The report for the project I was working on is done.

422
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,440
Take a look when you have the time.

423
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,799
- Okay. - Thank you.

424
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Yes.

425
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,640
The current market for hotels is particularly good.

426
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,039
Okay.

427
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
Let's talk about it some other time.

428
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,319
Okay, bye.

429
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
I'm so pissed off.

430
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,240
That Qiu Jun Lin and Feng Xiao are snakes.

431
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,519
They obviously didn't want to offend Xu Si Tian...

432
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,160
so they dug a hole for you to jump in and take the blame.

433
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:31,960
Exactly! It's a deep hole.

434
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,839
It's fine. I'll take it as weight training.

435
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,039
What did your boss say?

436
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,359
Did he speak up for you?

437
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,160
He said I couldn't even do that right...

438
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,759
and was only suited to be a secretary.

439
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,359
What kind of company is this?

440
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,440
I want to strangle those jerks for you.

441
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,319
Yue Lan,

442
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
help Meng Meng.

443
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
She's about to be bullied to death.

444
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,000
You're exaggerating.

445
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
These things happen.

446
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,640
Don't take it to heart.

447
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,960
How is that normal?

448
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,880
Ning Meng is made to be the scapegoat.

449
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,519
Then why isn't he letting others be one?

450
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Ning Meng.

451
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,440
When you were a secretary,

452
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,759
did you offend your boss?

453
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,160
Maybe.

454
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,079
These things are inevitable at work.

455
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,240
What you have to do...

456
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,559
is to see clearly what is at stake...

457
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,720
so that you won't let yourself be blamed for anything.

458
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,920
What are you saying, He Yue Lan?

459
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,200
You're not positive at all.

460
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,039
Take back your cheesy words.

461
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,160
Fine. Let's say I'm wrong.

462
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,599
Ning Meng, you two talk. I have work to do.

463
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,720
Meng Meng. Don't listen to him.

464
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,480
Stop yelling at Yue Lan.

465
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,759
He does have a point.

466
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,880
Qiu Jun Lin is a petty man.

467
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,400
It's personal.

468
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,119
Meng Meng.

469
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,200
Are you tired now that you've transferred?

470
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,039
I am very tired.

471
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,440
Do you regret it?

472
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,119
Ask me if I would rather jump off a building...

473
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,279
or go back to continue working for Lu.

474
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,519
Which one do I choose?

475
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
Which do you choose?

476
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,160
I'd jump off a building.

477
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,480
Does he want to make life hard for me?

478
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,039
But I'm flexible.

479
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,759
I'm very flexible.

480
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Be gentle.

481
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,839
Aren't we training?

482
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,480
Wait, you're in a bad mood. I won't play with you.

483
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,960
Get rid of Xu Si Tian immediately.

484
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,039
Do you hear me?

485
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,079
Is that it?

486
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,240
Can't you even stand her for two days?

487
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,640
Was it your idea?

488
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,319
How can such a low-class idea come from me?

489
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
I heard that Ning Meng...

490
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,319
was bullied by Tian Tian at the meeting...

491
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,279
and you added fuel to the fire.

492
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,960
I was just stating the facts.

493
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,880
Are you making things hard for Ning Meng...

494
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,240
so that she'll withdraw by herself?

495
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,079
I'm just helping her come to her senses.

496
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,359
All those years, I covered her.

497
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,880
She doesn't know the capital market is full of deceit.

498
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,200
Does she think she can do projects...

499
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,759
just by relying on her expertise...

500
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,200
and being diligent?

501
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,400
How silly.

502
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,000
Silly and sour.

503
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,359
If she doesn't fall, who will?

504
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,200
You have such a strange attitude.

505
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,519
Do you want her to come back...

506
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,839
or help her grow wings so she can fly?

507
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,240
Where can she fly to?

508
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,680
Even if she flies,

509
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,559
she can't get out of my hands.

510
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,880
Who gave you that confidence?

511
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:52,519
Do you think she'll be back...

512
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,599
if the secretary position is vacant?

513
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,240
If she's not stupid,

514
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,839
she'll know to give up.

515
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,799
In that case,

516
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,559
you're protecting her.

517
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,039
Who's protecting her?

518
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,880
That's only because Yang Xiao Yang...

519
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,519
is a terrible secretary.

520
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
Wait and see.

521
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,720
In two days, Ning Meng will come to me first...

522
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,839
to request to be transferred back.

523
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,519
So get rid of Xu Si Tian immediately.

524
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,200
Fine. I promise you, okay?

525
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:25,920
Let me hit you twice.

526
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,359
- You hit me just now. - I'm tired.

527
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,640
Bye.

528
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,640
Why, you...

529
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,759
You and your temper. Ning Meng will never...

530
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,319
She will never go back to you, no matter how hard it is.

531
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,160
Is table five ready? It's taking so long.

532
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,839
- Hello. Let me see. - Hello.

533
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,279
- How much longer do I have to wait? - I'll rush them.

534
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,039
You've rushed them a thousand times.

535
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,119
Zeng Yu Hang, are you blind?

536
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,799
I didn't see such a beautiful lady standing here.

537
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,880
I'm blind indeed.

538
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,920
It has been 40 minutes since I called you.

539
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,359
Did you crawl over here?

540
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,640
Hurry up and rush for the food.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,400
I'm exhausted.

542
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,880
The shoes don't even fit me.

543
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,680
Why are you wearing heels to get food?

544
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:23,440
Couldn't you just order for delivery?

545
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,960
He insisted that I buy it myself.

546
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,319
He said the food delivery man isn't on time...

547
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,519
and delays his work.

548
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I'm his secretary.

549
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,480
Consider it a service.

550
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,759
What a secretary.

551
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,759
I think he should get you two secretaries.

552
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
I don't see why not.

553
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,160
In that case, I'll be the Secretary-General.

554
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,400
This title does sound a little different.

555
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,839
They also have a Secretary-General at the UN.

556
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,960
Please.

557
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,920
Are you and their Secretary-General...

558
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,079
the same thing?

559
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,359
What do they do...

560
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,480
and what do you do?

561
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,880
Bug off.

562
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:54,839
Go rush them.

563
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm not driving. You do it.

564
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,920
All right.

565
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Here.

566
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Ms. Xu.

567
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,640
The cost of your delivery is a bit high.

568
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,640
How else do I do it?

569
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,759
How can I carry so much food by myself?

570
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,839
You're right.

571
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,880
How did Ning Meng do it?

572
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,039
She must be quite something.

573
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,359
Don't mention her when you're with me.

574
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,359
It's annoying.

575
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,400
Come on, let's go.

576
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,920
The driver is thirsty. Let me drink some water.

577
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:50,799
Tian Tian.

578
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,119
Do you have the wrong imaginary enemy in mind?

579
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,799
Ning Meng had been with Lu Ji Ming...

580
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,920
for three years.

581
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,000
Has he ever looked at her?

582
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,240
You know...

583
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
the one he likes.

584
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,079
It's not Ning Meng, but Ms. Meng.

585
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,880
That was a long time ago.

586
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
He was a kid back then. What do you know?

587
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,640
Then you don't know.

588
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,960
If I were always left at home alone...

589
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,319
like young Lu Ji Ming,

590
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,359
my heart would flutter...

591
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,799
if a pretty girl next door played with me and took care of me.

592
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,920
Ms. Meng already has a fiancé in the US.

593
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,599
Ming Ming has long given up.

594
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,920
That doesn't extinguish her glamorous image in Ming's mind.

595
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,839
Look at you.

596
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,839
Instead of setting a good example,

597
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,160
you imitate Ning Meng...

598
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,839
and make yourself into a mess.

599
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,680
Do you think being close to him is helping?

600
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,759
You're making him hate looking at you.

601
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,599
Speaking of which,

602
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,920
it's so hard to be like Ms. Meng.

603
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,319
Not everyone can be like her.

604
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,559
- Are you provoking me? - No.

605
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,039
I'm even willing to work as a secretary.

606
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,319
There's nothing I can't do.

607
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,160
It's difficult.

608
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,480
Look at Ms. Meng.

609
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,759
She's beautiful and elegant.

610
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,000
She's just like a goddess.

611
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,319
The point is, she has her own business.

612
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,359
Didn't you hear about how well she's doing...

613
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,519
in the design circle in the US?

614
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,559
I'm quite like a goddess myself.

615
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,759
Right?

616
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,720
Did you mean...

617
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,799
I did it wrong?

618
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,359
Of course.

619
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,480
You're working hard in vain.

620
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,119
You took the wrong stick, Tian Tian.

621
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,680
No, you're cursing me.

622
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,039
I wouldn't dare.

623
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,960
You're a giant panda with a huge bamboo stick.

624
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,920
Get back your goddess image.

625
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,839
Make Ming Ming's heart flutter.

626
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
Ming Ming, I'm sorry.

627
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,759
I think I'm better suited to be Director Xu,

628
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,960
not Secretary Xu.

629
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,039
I'll take a couple of days off in Europe...

630
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,640
and turn to the art world for a bit of investment.

631
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,680
I'll buy some paintings for collection.

632
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,200
Don't worry. I'll bring you a gift.

633
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Bye.

634
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,599
Hey.

635
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,839
You're good.

636
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,599
How did you handle her?

637
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
It's a trade secret. I have no comment.

638
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,119
You're very virtuous.

639
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,079
This time,

640
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
she won't come back, right?

641
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
No.

642
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,319
Are you still worried with me on it?

643
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,680
Why are you being so secretive?

644
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,839
What are you whispering for?

645
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,839
For you,

646
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,519
I got myself involved.

647
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,599
What do you mean? Did she hit you?

648
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,640
She wouldn't dare.

649
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,200
She asked me to hang out with her.

650
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
Remember to bring me along when you have projects.

651
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,440
- Zeng Yu Hang. - I'm coming.

652
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,400
I'm hanging up. Don't forget what I've done for you.

653
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Hello?

654
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,559
Xiao Yang.

655
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Come here.

656
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,289
Clean this up.

657
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,199
These are all Ms. Xu's belongings.

658
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,599
It's okay. Ms. Xu has resigned.

659
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,119
What are you waiting for? Clean it up.

660
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,199
What's with the tone?

661
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,519
Some people will know how to quit.

662
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Mr. Lu.

663
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,440
I have something to report.

664
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,960
Come in.

665
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Mr. Lu.

666
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,159
Regarding Ms. Xu's RV camp project,

667
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,119
what should we do next?

668
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:26,880
- What do you think? - Me?

669
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,559
I...

670
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Isn't Ms. Xu quite interested in this project?

671
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,599
But of course.

672
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,599
It's up to you to decide.

673
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,159
Mr. Qiu, you're a smart man.

674
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,920
Your intelligence...

675
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:44,559
should be used outside.

676
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,679
Isn't it a pity...

677
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:50,159
to waste it on one of our own?

678
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,639
Yes.

679
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,639
There's no next time.

680
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,119
Okay. Wait, Mr. Lu.

681
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,920
Regarding this project,

682
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,289
it's better if you give your opinion.

683
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,769
Ms. Feng.

684
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,360
Is there anything I can do...

685
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,679
about reviewing the RV camp project?

686
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:33,809
No. You can leave this project for now.

687
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,159
Now is not the right time.

688
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,480
Come back to it sometime later.

689
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,559
Are we dropping it?

690
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,039
Didn't you study finance?

691
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,480
Don't you understand?

692
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:45,360
After a while,

693
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,329
there might be new developments in the market.

694
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,960
Maybe some projects will be successful...

695
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:51,840
and some will fail.

696
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
Whether it's good or not...

697
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,960
depends on the time window.

698
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,960
Is that Mr. Lu's instruction?

699
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,519
Yes.

700
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,079
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Feng.

701
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,159
Is there anything else I can do?

702
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,519
This is for the meeting the day after tomorrow.

703
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,880
Please make copies.

704
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,559
Okay.

705
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:24,719
- Shan Shan. - Ning Meng.

706
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:33,769
Do you need help?

707
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,159
It's okay. I'm just looking for a document.

708
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,039
Why can't I find it?

709
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,559
Projects from 2015 and 2016?

710
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,639
Why are they here?

711
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,480
Are those eliminated projects?

712
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,559
They were sifted down by the committee.

713
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,920
There are all sorts of projects.

714
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,960
Some are quite interesting.

715
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,679
I found it.

716
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:01,559
- Ning Meng, I'll get back to work. - Okay.

717
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,809
Mr. Lu.

718
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,639
What's the date today?

719
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
It's the 13th.

720
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:37,360
Time flies.

721
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,519
You were right,

722
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,199
Mr. Lu.

723
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,639
Ning Meng.

724
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,809
It's good that you figured it out.

725
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:00,159
You really didn't have to hold out for two months.

726
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm talking about the RV camp project.

727
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,840
You made a wise decision.

728
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm not asking about that.

729
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,119
What are you looking at?

730
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,239
Aren't these the projects that have been eliminated?

731
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
What are you doing with them?

732
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,289
I just want to go through the old projects...

733
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,719
and see if I can find anything new.

734
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,440
What can you find...

735
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,079
with eliminated projects?

736
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,639
Is our company that incompetent?

737
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,519
Some projects might not be right at the moment,

738
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,000
but there might be a new life to them...

739
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,239
with the change of time.

740
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,809
It's all thanks to your reminder.

741
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,719
What are you thanking me for?

742
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,289
What did I remind you of?

743
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't understand.

744
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,880
You take the other elevator.

745
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,360
Why?

746
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,440
Seeing you makes me upset.
