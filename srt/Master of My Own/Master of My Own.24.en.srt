3
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,340
Ning Meng.

4
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,800
Mengmeng, are you all right?

5
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm fine.

6
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,770
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,150
I wasn't here on time and made you get injured.

8
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,420
Sorry to trouble you.

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,550
I thank you on behalf of Mengmeng.

10
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,710
You're too polite, Mr. Su.

11
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,800
It's nothing much.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,060
Mr. Lu is such a good boss.

13
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,560
You are so considerate of your former employee.

14
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,290
How rare.

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,530
It's what I should do.

16
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,240
I think Mengmeng is scared.

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,080
I'll take her back to rest.

18
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,500
Mr. Lu, I hope you will forgive me.

19
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,530
Get well soon.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,660
Song will pick you up, right?

21
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,540
He's already here.

22
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,890
Great. We'll be leaving then.

23
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,620
Let's go.

24
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,200
A girl like you went to such a dangerous place.

25
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,550
Why didn't you tell me at once?

26
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,580
I was in a rush.

27
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,670
I couldn't think of contacting anyone else.

28
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,530
What about Lu Jiming?

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,190
He suddenly appeared there.

30
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,880
He said Mr. Tang told him.

31
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,780
Don't you know what his purpose is until now?

32
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,140
Are you giving him a chance to pursue you?

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,240
What do you mean by giving him a chance to pursue me?

34
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,780
If he didn't appear there suddenly, we wouldn't even be able to meet usually.

35
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,490
Senior, you are overthinking.

36
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,550
Eaglestone Capital and Joint Capital have a close working relationship.

37
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,900
How could you not see him?

38
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,700
Even if we see each other, it's only for work purposes.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,930
Didn't you say you won't be able to meet him?

40
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,230
Senior, don't you think you are overreacting?

41
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,080
I am overreacting?

42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,400
I know what these rich kids think.

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,320
They are using every opportunity to pursue a person.

44
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,170
You don't know anything because you are naive.

45
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,200
You are really overthinking.

46
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,010
Besides, Lu Jiming is not that kind of person.

47
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,970
Are you siding with him?

48
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,550
You don't trust him, and you don't trust me either?

49
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,020
How can I... How can I trust you?

50
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,050
Sorry. I was not myself just now.

51
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,790
Sorry.

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,950
I hope you can understand.

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,430
I was betrayed in my last relationship.

54
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,780
That was why I was very afraid. I...

55
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,670
I've become very sensitive.

56
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,350
I did that because I am afraid of losing you.

57
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,780
Senior.

58
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,420
I understand.

59
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,820
But I know what I am doing.

60
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,330
I won't do something to betray you.

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,040
I just hope you don't bring

62
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,750
the bad experience of your previous relationship to our current relationship.

63
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,820
All right?

64
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,690
I know.

65
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,000
I shouldn't have doubted you.

66
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,790
I will control myself not to think that way.

67
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,440
I won't be so reckless anymore.

68
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,790
Forgive me. All right?

69
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,510
You got scared today, right?

70
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,900
It's fine. I'm feeling better now.

71
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,000
Sorry.

72
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,250
I'll send you back.

73
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,100
Get some good rest. All right?

74
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,270
Mr. Tang.

75
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,320
<i>Ning Meng, I still want to increase my investment ratio.</i>

76
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,440
<i>I can give you more money.</i>

77
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,620
Mr. Tang, as far as I know,

78
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,450
Kirin is expanding the manufacturing line.

79
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,610
<i>[Ning Meng]
Also, the investment share we discussed previously, it's already the best you can do.</i>

80
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,830
How did you get extra funds suddenly?

81
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,180
Just don't care about that.

82
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,990
I just think you should focus your efforts to solve your current problem, right?

83
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,590
Are the funds from Mr. Lu?

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,970
No. Definitely not.

85
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,100
<i>It's not Mr. Lu's money.</i>

86
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,910
Help me thank him.

87
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,220
There's no need.

88
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,080
<i>I will solve Ms. Liu's current problem for now.</i>

89
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
<i>Thank you.</i>

90
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,720
- Mr. Lu, well...
- It's fine.

91
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
Thanks, Old Tang.

92
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,250
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

93
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,010
- I'm leaving.
- We are leaving. Ning Meng, I'm leaving.

94
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

95
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,980
Senior, why are you here?

96
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,240
I knew you would still be working overtime.

97
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,690
Come on, let's eat something.

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,200
How's the problem?

99
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,230
I haven't thought of a way yet.

100
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:15,180
If you need it, I can help you secure funding.

101
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,250
Do you really think this is a good project?

102
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,660
Thank you.

103
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,820
If you don't think this project is good for you, there's no need to help me.

104
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,980
Do you take me for a stranger?

105
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,700
No.

106
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:41,140
I just think I will be facing many different problems at work in the future.

107
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,740
I can't get your help every time, right?

108
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,030
I will think of another way.

109
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,570
All right.

110
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,310
If you need me, I will always be here.

111
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,860
Hello, Mr. Lu.

112
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,960
How's your injury?

113
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,800
It's nothing serious. I'm fine.

114
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,330
Well, Tang Zhengwang called me.

115
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,000
Thanks for your kindness. I appreciate it.

116
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,550
<i>I know you want to depend on yourself.</i>

117
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,080
<i>But I've never seen such a stubborn person like you.</i>

118
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,710
Did you call me just to say I'm stubborn?

119
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,540
I'm here to motivate you.

120
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,970
I want you to do your best.

121
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,140
Every cloud has a silver lining.

122
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,010
Thank you.

123
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,040
Do you remember I used to tell you that you couldn't be in charge of projects?

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,150
You just had to transfer to the Project Department to give it a try.

125
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,940
In the end, you really succeeded.

126
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,060
That means your choices are still reliable.

127
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,410
It's right to believe in yourself.

128
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,520
Are you being sarcastic?

129
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,270
I am obviously giving you motivation.

130
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,030
<i>Yes. Motivation.</i>

131
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,050
I get it now.

132
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,950
You are right.

133
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,050
I should believe in myself.

134
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,210
Just like that time.

135
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,100
I have to let others see what I can do so others will let me do the project.

136
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,970
<i>For example, when you make a pot of delicious chicken soup,</i>

137
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,410
you need to let others try it.

138
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,590
If they think it's good, they will use more money to order more soup.

139
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,400
That's right.

140
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,130
You have a smart brain now.

141
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,640
You know everything immediately.

142
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,700
Thanks, my friend.

143
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,220
You're welcome, my friend.

144
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,610
Ms. Liu.

145
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,030
Perfect timing.

146
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,270
Do you know I've cooked these noodles?

147
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,030
Sit down.

148
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,930
Here.

149
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,810
I wanted to let you try my cooking.

150
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,640
What a coincidence. Here. For you.

151
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
Thank you.

152
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,640
It's delicious.

153
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,750
Let me make you some vegetables.

154
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,950
Sure.

155
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:36,230
It's a pity if I can't let everyone use such a good pot.

156
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,350
Ning Meng, I might have to disappoint you.

157
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,640
I might have to delay this project.

158
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,440
I've gathered the penalty for breaching the contract.

159
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,420
I will do my best to pay the compensation.

160
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,440
Ms. Liu, since you have the money, why not give it a try?

161
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,300
How can I cover such a big cash flow gap with that little money?

162
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,990
Maybe my ex-husband was right.

163
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm not ready to start a business yet.

164
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,450
He was right.

165
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,310
To be honest, someone told me that I was not suited for investment.

166
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,940
He said I was not cut out for investing.

167
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,662
But I worked hard to do it.

168
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:25,560
I had met obstacles and failures,

169
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,630
but the result proved that I did it.

170
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,090
More and more people are coming to me to talk about projects.

171
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,310
So, I think you should give it a try.

172
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,910
It's not that I don't want to try,

173
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,890
but right now, I really can't find a solution.

174
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,460
Maybe we can try it from another direction.

175
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,050
Let's forget about manufacturing for a moment.

176
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,810
Let's build up the reputation of Donlim Pot.

177
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,170
Let everyone see the value of Donlim Pot.

178
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,680
After all, you need to use it first before knowing if a product is good.

179
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,260
When you have good reviews, you will attract investors and we can proceed with manufacturing.

180
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,430
Before I came, I called Mr. Liang and Mr. Tang to discuss this.

181
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,550
We can use some products that we have as free gifts

182
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,520
and put them on the market, so everyone can use them as a trial.

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,700
This time, we can use the money you've gathered for marketing purposes.

184
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,890
I've done the math.

185
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,890
It's enough.

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,970
My back is against the wall.

187
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,780
I'll give it a try then.

188
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,740
This is really delicious.

189
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,770
<i>[mobi sport]</i>

190
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,550
It's a good pot. It's really great.

191
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,280
Giving out such a good pot with the purchase of a fitness machine.

192
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,650
Ms. Liu, isn't your promotion expense too high for this?

193
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,630
Mr. Lin, to be honest, this is our last-ditch attempt.

194
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,360
We are not seeking profits.

195
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,670
We want publicity and a good reputation.

196
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,900
A good product will always sell.

197
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,770
We can get new investments that way, too.

198
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,030
You are right.

199
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,700
Mobi also became successful because of good word-of-mouth.

200
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,180
But, Ning Meng, I am still curious.

201
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,080
How did you think of collaborating with us?

202
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,780
Look. A running machine and a pot.

203
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,380
These two items don't feel like they belong in the same category.

204
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,360
I think both these products have similarities.

205
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,270
Mobi prioritizes socialization.

206
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,660
It encourages everyone to cheer up.

207
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,370
Lehui's Donlim Pot encourages everyone and shares the fun of cooking.

208
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,060
These two products provide everyone with a concept of sharing happiness in life.

209
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,210
Their target consumers are overlapped.

210
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,870
Your idea is new.

211
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,310
I think it can be used in this promotional advertisement.

212
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,030
What do you think, Ms. Liu?

213
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,090
That's great.

214
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:44,780
Oh, Ning Meng. You didn't go all-in on Mobi, right?

215
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,030
Do you want me to introduce other channels to you?

216
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,560
Thank you, Mr. Lin. We've made all the arrangements.

217
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,630
Besides Mobi, we also got a food app to work with us.

218
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,100
We've launched Donlim Pot Recipes and worked with sharing platforms for a lucky draw event.

219
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,530
We also prepared a product live broadcast that's popular now.

220
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,700
There are many channels.

221
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,770
See that? Only Ning Meng is so considerate.

222
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,810
Yes.

223
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,240
Ms. Liu, let's have a wonderful collaboration.

224
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
When your pot becomes popular, remember to help Mobi boost our sales.

225
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,620
Thank you. Thanks for your good wishes.

226
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,130
You have to thank Ning Meng.

227
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,950
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

228
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,200
Thank you.

229
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,410
Here. Careful.

230
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,430
Here.

231
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,470
Be careful, everyone.

232
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,880
Handle them with caution. Careful.

233
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,250
Okay.

234
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,180
Over here.

235
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,380
Bring it here.

236
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,880
Okay.

237
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,070
Let's hope everything goes smoothly.

238
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,980
Ning Meng, thank you.

239
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,190
It's what I should do.

240
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,110
<i>Ms. Liu, I heard you designed this pot yourself.</i>

241
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,400
<i>That's right.</i>

242
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,300
<i>In the past, I was a full-time housewife.
[Donlim, the preferred choice]</i>

243

<i>- I spent a lot of time cooking.
- Yes.</i>

244
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,610
<i>- It was troublesome for me.
- It was indeed.</i>

245
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,040
<i>I was thinking about whether I can use my kitchen experience</i>

246
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,900
<i>to design a pot that's convenient for everyone.</i>

247
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,860
Two days ago, I won a Donlim Pot as well.

248
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,060
It is really good.

249
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,320
I've been using it to cook for three days.

250
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,520
Really? Was it the pot we used to have the hotpot yesterday?

251
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,020
Yes. That was the one.

252
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,230
I also used it to make sandwiches this morning.

253

257
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,800
That's right. I sent you a Lehui proposal before.

258
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,810
Yes. We still need an investor currently.

259
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,520
No problem. Let's meet up and have a talk.

260
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,460
Sure. Bye.

Sure, Mr. Liang. Let's meet up and have a talk.

264
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
- Morning, Ms. Shi.
- Good morning.

265
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,110
Morning, Ms. Shi.

266
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,560
Your last-ditch attempt was bold.

- You are smart.
- Thank you, Ms. Shi.

268
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,880
Sure. Arrange it. Let's discuss it when we meet.

269
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,800
This is our company's latest product. An air fryer.

270
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
It's used for low-fat frying.

271
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,000
It also has many benefits of multipurpose cooking pots.

I even made you a lemon-colored one. Look.

274

There's also a small lemon here.

You contributed the most to Lehui's revival this time.

In the end, it's still the product that won over the market.

You were sending help when I needed it.

Do you still remember at the OEM factory?

284
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,400
You were always walking in front and so bold.

285
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
You also accompanied me

286
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,800
and ate vegetable noodles in the office.

287
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,000
You understand me and support me.

But nothing matters now.

Let's go.

320
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
Why don't we go to another restaurant?

321
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
There's no need.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,500
I think it should be soon.

323
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
It was tough to get out of that dire situation this time.

324
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,500
So, you were right to be persistent.

325
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I think you will be promoted soon.

326
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,000
I have never thought about promotion.

327
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
I think succeeding in this

00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
and helping an enterprise makes me satisfied.

329
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
You always think about other people.

330
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,500
You should think about yourself sometimes.

331
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
Eaglestone Capital is just normal after all.

332
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,600
I think you need a larger platform

333
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,400
with your current capabilities.

334
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I have not thought about this yet.

335
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,600
You can think about it when the time is right.

336
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
All right.

337
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,100
I'm going to the toilet.

338
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I think it's over there.

339
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
<i>[Lu XX: Are you okay?]
[Ning Meng: I'm fine. Thank you for asking.]</i>

340
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,900
<i>[Lu XX: Congratulations.]
[Ning Meng: Thank you for your advice.]</i>

341
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,200
Sir. Miss. This way, please.

342
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,700
Okay.

343
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,900
Ning Meng, let's go.

344
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,200
Okay.

345
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Mr. Lu, why did you win again?

346
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,200
You've won so many times.

347
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,800
Can't you go easy on us?

348
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,000
I did.

349
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,800
You didn't grasp the chance.

350
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,400
No way. Let's play another round.

351
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
It's almost time for me to go back.

352
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,800
I'm not playing.

353
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
That's not right.

354
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Are you leaving after winning?

355
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,800
We only meet once after a few months.

356
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Today, I won't let you leave easily.

357
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,200
Yes. Another person is coming.

358
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,800
I heard he's an expert.

359
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Are you talking about Mr. Su?

360
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Mr. Lu, Mr. Su is a true opponent.

361
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Yes, Mr. Lu.

362
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
When he's here,

363
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't think you can keep your top ranking.

364
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Speaking of the devil.

365
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,100
Mr. Su, we've been waiting for you.

366
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,800
Mr. Wang, sorry, I was stuck in traffic.

367
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
It's fine.

368
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,800
An expert always arrives last.

369
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Come on.

370
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Mr. Su, long time no see.

371
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Come and play over here.

372
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Sure. Sorry for taking your place.

373
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,800
Please.

374
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,600
Mr. Lu is here, too?

375
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,500
Hello, Mr. Su.

376
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,400
You know each other?

377
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,300
I don't have to introduce you both then.

378
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,800
Let's begin.

379
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Mr. Lu, please.

380
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Sure, I'll play another round.

381
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Mr. Su, do you play often?

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
I do.

383
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,800
Mr. Su, let me explain.

384
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
We are playing Texas Hold'em.

385
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
The chips represent points.

386
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
The points decide the result.

387
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,400
No problem.

388
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,000
Mr. Su, this is too cruel.

389
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
If you do it like this,

390
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,500
we can't even see the next card.

391
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,600
I have good cards.

392
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,800
I have to press the attack.

393
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,100
Fine. I will not humiliate myself then.

394
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,400
I fold.

395
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
I'll give you the chance.

396
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Let's see which of you can defeat Mr. Su.

397
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,300
Mr. Lu, are you still playing?

398
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,400
Of course. Why not?

399
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Mr. Lu, are you too obsessed?

400
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,200
You can't be emotional when playing Texas Hold'em.

401
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,300
Stop and fold when you should.

402
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,800
Don't embarrass yourself.

403
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
The last card has yet to be dealt.

404
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,300
The final result is still unknown.

405
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Mr. Su is so straightforward.

406
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
I don't think he is bluffing.

407
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,400
Mr. Lu will most probably lose.

408
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
All-in.

409
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,500
Are you going that far?

410
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,400
Both of you.

411
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,600
Do you have some kind of grudge against each other?

412
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
We are just starting

413
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,400
and both of you are going all-in?

414
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,600
What's wrong? Trying to settle this within a game?

415
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
It's not bad.

416
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,000
I don't like to drag things out.

417
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,200
Me neither.

418
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,500
Seems like Mr. Su is guaranteed to have three aces.

419
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,400
But Mr. Lu's hand doesn't seem too good.

420
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Three-of-a-kind and two pairs can't even win against him.

421
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
Mr. Su is trying to cut off his retreat.

422
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,800
Mr. Lu will be embarrassed.

423
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Call.

424
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,300
Mr. Lu, show me your cards.

425
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
He really has three aces.

426
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,700
Yes.

427
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,800
I do have small numbers.

428
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,400
But it's just right for a straight.

429
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
He wins like that.

430
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,400
- Incredible.
- His luck...

431
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
One, two, three, four, five.

432
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,800
It's better than three-of-a-kind.

433
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Awesome. It's a comeback.

434
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Mr. Lu has made a comeback.

435
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
Mr. Lu is so daring.

436
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,700
Mr. Su, I guess you got too obsessed.

437
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,600
You were too emotional on the last hand.

438
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,800
All right. Continue without me.

439
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm heading home.

440
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,500
Goodbye.

441
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,000
- Mr. Lu.
- Careful, Mr. Lu.

442
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,800
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

443
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,600
Are we still playing?

444
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Come on, deal the cards.

445
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,800
Why is there such a big change in equity suddenly?

446
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,600
It's normal.

447
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,000
A capital war looks like a fight for equity on the surface,

448
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,300
but in truth, this is Lu Tianxing and Lu Guoyu

449
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,600
fighting for shareholder rights.

450
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,400
But with Shuangxun Capital's major acquisition,

451
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
won't this become a three-way battle

452
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,800
instead of a two-way battle instead?

453
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,400
That's right.

454
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,000
Hello, Mr. Lu.

455
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,800
<i>[Being greedy? Shuangxun currently holds as much as 15% of the equity!]</i>

456
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,820
<i>[Being greedy? Shuangxun currently holds as much as 15% of the equity!]</i>

457
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,100
Have you seen the news about Shuangxun?

458
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,050
Yes.

459
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,350
According to industry professionals' analysis,

460
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,100
Shuangxun and Lu Tianxing are like

461
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,010
Zhou Yu and Huang Gai.
<i>(Both parties agree of their own free will)</i>

462
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,520
They looked like they were in a tense situation,

463
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,100
but both of them actually did this willingly.

464
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,560
Now that I think about it, it does feel that way.

465
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,700
Do you think Shuangxun can really acquire the equity easily?

466
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,490
I'm sure they have an agreement in private.

467
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,640
This means Shuangxun is a mercenary hired by Lu Tianxing.

468
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,200
The stakes they acquired helped him get back the shareholder rights.

469
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,110
In that case, according to the current situation,

470
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,230
Lu Guoyu and his Guoyu Group's share acquisition ability will be limited.

471
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,680
Lu Tianxing and his supporters are the ones who have the advantage.

472
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,420
If everything goes well, Lu's team

473
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,040
will probably achieve victory in the end.

474
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
I wonder how it goes.

475
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,790
Perhaps there will be a huge change.

476
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,630
Let's just wait and see.

477
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,940
Coming.

478
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,040
Mingming, why are you here?

479
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm here to see my dad.

480
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,370
Have you eaten?

481
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,440
Not yet.

482
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,970
Let's eat together.

483
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,570
Come in.

484
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,660
Tian, get a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.

485
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,320
Coming.

486
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,220
Mingming, if I knew, I would've asked her to make a few more dishes.

487
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,180
It's fine. I'm not picky.

488
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,660
Hurry up. Sit down and eat.

489
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,290
Dad.

490
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,680
Why did you come back suddenly?

491
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,500
I was passing by, so I came here to visit.

492
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,860
Eat.

493
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,660
Get some soup.

494
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,540
Dad, regarding Shuangxun increasing its stakes...

495
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,250
What's wrong?

496
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,500
Is it too fast and too many?

497
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,870
I'm afraid you got anxious and got taken advantage of.

498
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,800
It's business.

499
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,280
We should trust people whenever possible.

500
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,970
Only work with people we don't doubt.

501
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,040
But isn't Lu Guoyu someone you chose?

502
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't have let his Guoyu Group

503
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,890
acquire Qinhe's shares back then.

504
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,650
I trusted him back then.

505
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,770
But he has changed too much in recent years.

506
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,700
He used Guoyu Group's position as a major shareholder

507
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,890
to interfere with Qinhe's operation.

508
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,660
Especially in the past two years,

509
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,940
he has been acting against me in some major decisions.

510
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,930
For example, the sewage treatment project.

511
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,260
I kept reminding them

512
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,790
to verify it many times before launching it to the market.

513
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,910
Being responsible for ourselves means being responsible to society, too.

514
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,930
When a project goes to the market from the research and development stage,

515
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,270
you need to meet its objective law.

516
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,000
Moreover, we are in the environmental protection industry.

517
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,630
You can't rush things.

518
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,260
But Guoyu wouldn't listen.

519
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,170
He was rushing to latch on to this opportunity.

520
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,580
He is rushing to get the profits.

521
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,740
He made a good environmental protection project into a mess.

522
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,370
That is why

523
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,360
Lu no longer has his original intention anymore.

524
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,180
Dad, I agree with what you said.

525
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,870
I'm sure you did it for the company and the project.

526
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:11,292
Then, can you speak to Lu Guoyu nicely again?

527
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:13,870
Tell him what you think.

528
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:17,130
Do you think I didn't do that?

529
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,740
But this guy just wouldn't listen to anyone.

530
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,260
If he listened to what I said,

531
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,910
I wouldn't have to do so much.

532
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,260
Dad, I think the way you do the talking matters too.

533
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,610
There's no need to let both sides suffer a loss.

534
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:39,310
Could it be because you were too harsh on him?

535
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,180
Are you teaching me how to do things?

536
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,740
It was his problem.

537
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,790
He should be reflecting on his mistakes.

538
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,350
Do I need to beg him?

539
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,940
No. Dad, you've misunderstood. I don't mean that.

540
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,270
I think we should solve our internal conflicts behind closed doors.

541
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,000
There's no need to involve other companies.

542
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,420
There are too many unknown factors.

543
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,730
We can't put all our trust into Shuangxun.

544
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,480
That's too...

545
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,590
Did you come back to eat or did you come back to point fingers at me?

546
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,290
Do you know Qinhe better than me?

547
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,750
Or do you think I have a better solution and I won't use it?

548
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,250
Old Lu!

549
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,490
Old Lu, you were talking.

550
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,050
Why did you get angry again?

551
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,600
Come and eat.

552
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,670
Mingming, eat.

553
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,680
Dad, I won't say anymore. Let's eat.

554
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,120
All right. Hurry up.

555
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,800
Come on, let's eat.

556
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,610
Today's weather is so good.

557
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,930
The wind is so comfortable.

558
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

559
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,820
<i>[Shuangxun acquires more shares again. Their shareholding percentage hits a new high.]</i>

560
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:51,430
My colleagues are all discussing Shuangxun and Qinhe.

561
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,010
What do you think?

562
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,900
I don't know much about the secondary market.

563
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,410
I also don't know how this situation will progress.

564
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,580
Do you know Qinhe?

565
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,330
Not really.

566
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,330
Why are we talking about work again?

567
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,860
We came out to have a walk.

568
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,370
Let's go.

569
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,260
<i>[Xiao: Today's grass is hot.]</i>

570
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,660
<i>[He Yueluan]</i>

571
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,220
Hello?

572
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,950
<i>Hello, Ning Meng.</i>

573
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,820
<i>Come and pick You Qi up.</i>

574
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,200
<i>I am having an important discussion with a client.</i>

575
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,740
<i>She came and caused trouble. I don't know what's wrong with her.</i>

576
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,570
Where are you?

577
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,870
<i>I'll send you the location.</i>

578
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,660
I'll come over immediately.

579
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,550
He Yueluan, I'm asking you again. Will you go home with me?

580
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
I am working.

581
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,320
Calm down. Let's talk it out.

582
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,810
I am talking to you! Can't you hear me?

583
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,620
Sister-in-law, you should stop embarrassing Mr. He...

584
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,440
Who are you calling "sister-in-law"?

585
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,600
This is none of your business.

586
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,700
Are you going home or not?

587
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,860
I told you I'm working. What is wrong with you?

588
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,640
Ning Meng, take her back.

589
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,250
Qiqi, let's go back.

590
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,400
Are you working here?

591
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,370
Look at her outfit.

592
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,560
- Are you working or are you a hostess?
- Mind your words.

593
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,870
You Qi, she's my colleague.

594
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,540
Colleague?

595
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,860
She even clung to you!

596
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,570
You...

597
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,400
Be nice. Go home, all right?

598
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,390
He Yueluan, I'm asking you again.

599
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,930
Are you going home or not?

600
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,820
If you don't, don't think of coming back ever again.

601
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,580
Can you stop being unreasonable?

602
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,550
This place is full of people! Don't you think it's embarrassing?

603
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,600
Go home now!

604
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,910
Why are you yelling?

605
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,140
Why are you yelling at her?

606
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,760
You Qi, you've misunderstood.

607
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,950
Mr. He's wine poured on me.

608
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,590
You Qi is right.

609
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,070
This is their problem. It's none of your business.

610
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,970
He Yueluan, I'm taking You Qi back.

611
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,180
You better behave yourself.
