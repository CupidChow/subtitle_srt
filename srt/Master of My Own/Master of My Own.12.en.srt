00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,830
We're here.

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,730
I enjoyed it today.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,410
I enjoyed it, too.

6
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,280
Thank you, Senior.

7
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,730
Rest early.

8
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,850
I'll go up first, then.

9
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,370
All right.

10
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,850
Am I invisible?

11
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,850
Am I like the thin air to you?

12
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,080
No, you're not air.

13
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,340
You're more like ammonia gas.

14
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,440
What do you want?

15
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,770
I have something to tell you.

16
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,710
Say it then.

17
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,410
Well, how long is your contract with Shi Ying?

18
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,820
A year? Two years?

19
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,920
Every single year.

20
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,630
Nonsense.

21
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,430
I think it's a year at most.

22
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,030
It's been half a year now,

23
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,010
meaning there are only a few months left.

24
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,470
If I ask you to resign now, it's like I'm breaking up the partnership with Shi Ying.

25
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,940
So this is what you'll do.

26
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,110
After your contract expires, don't extend it with her.

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,810
When you come back to my company,

28
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,520
I won't force you to be my secretary.

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,980
You can focus on investment fully.

30
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,320
Okay, so be it.

31
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,450
Who do you think you are?

32
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,080
Why are you acting as if you are blessing me,

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,430
thinking that I'll go back just because you said so?

34
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,930
If you want me to work as an investor, I should be the investor.

35
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,830
When you want to mock me, you'll mock me.

36
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,250
I'll say this one last time. I'm not going back.

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,930
Because I don't want to see you at all.

38
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,800
No, Ning Meng…

39
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,560
Also, I'm not your toy to ease your boredom.

40
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,460
Please respect me.

41
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,890
In the future, if it's not work-related, don't call me.

42
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,370
Wait…

43
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,460
Ning Meng.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,280
You are really something. Were you apologizing or arguing?

45
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,640
No… Why did you bring the trash back?

46
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,720
Can't you throw it away?

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,230
Didn't she want to invest?

48
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,650
I'm letting her do that.

49
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,220
Why is she still so angry?

50
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,030
I told you many times that she just wants respect.

51
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,770
You can't just push whatever you think is good into her hands.

52
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,430
Do you know what respect is?

53
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,770
Respect includes respecting her personality, her will, and her choice.

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,320
Look at you.

55
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,720
You were there to apologize, not to send her an offer.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,550
I'm sorry. <i>(He said it in English, Korean, and Japanese)</i>

57
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,210
Can you say that?

58
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,140
Did you say it before?

59
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,230
Then this is your first time.

60
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,840
Cherish it. Go for it.

61
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,150
Don't tell me you're afraid to say it.

62
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,560
What could I be afraid of?

63
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,830
It's too late now. I'll make it clear tomorrow.

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,180
Going to work?

65
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,260
Where else?

66
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,260
Excuse me.

67
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,860
Wait a minute.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,150
Well,

69
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,250
last night, I gave it some careful consideration.

70
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,270
How about you? Did you consider it?

71
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,840
I think I've made that clear.

72
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
Please excuse me.

73
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,240
I came here early in the morning, I'm being very sincere.

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,350
What is this attitude of yours?

75
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,310
Wait. Why are you running?

76
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,650
Hey!

77
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,600
Can you give me a clear answer?

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,710
Okay.

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,150
Mr. Lu, are you begging me to rejoin Joint Capital?

80
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,420
It is not begging. It is allowing.

81
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,920
Goodbye.

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,110
Okay, I'm begging, all right?

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,520
I mean, this counts as begging.

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,260
I respect your choice.

85
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,130
Just stay wherever you think is best for you.

86
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,920
I won't stop you.

87
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,210
Is this an apology?

88
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,800
What apology? I'm making peace.

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,010
Making peace, right?

90
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,120
Okay, I accept it.

91
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,790
Okay then. We will put this behind us completely.

92
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,160
Hold on.

93
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,200
What's your relationship with Su Weiran?

94
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,380
Are you some cop on the Pacific Ocean?

95
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,100
- What do you mean
- You care too much.

96
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,920
I'm asking both of you if have joint investments.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,570
Do you know what kind of person he is?

98
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,500
We knew each other at university.

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,980
I don't need you to tell me what kind of person he is.

100
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,190
With your insight,

101
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,600
you can't tell if he's reliable or not.

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,390
I have endured three years with you.

103
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,550
With these three years of experience,

104
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,940
no matter how unreliable others are, they are more reliable than you.

105
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,050
What do you mean, Ning Meng?

106
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,040
What did you say?

107
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,460
Ning Meng, make it clear to me.

108
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,260
Can you stop following me?

109
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,630
You're like a perverted stalker, you know?

110
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,290
Don't say nonsense. Who is following you?

111
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,690
Can't I take the subway?

112
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,270
You're someone who complains the seat on a Maybach is too hard. Taking the subway?

113
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,120
Mr. Lu, stop making things hard for us both.

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,480
Who is the one making things hard here?

115
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,230
What does it mean to tolerate me for three years?

116
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,800
Why were you "tolerating" me?

117
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,680
Was I abusing you or venting on you?

118
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,100
One has to put up with your bad temper in order to get along with you.

119
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,860
Why don't you just say that you're petty?

120
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,560
These are small matters, yet you remember them until now.

121
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,100
Never mind. I am a forgiving person.

122
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,560
I am great because I am magnanimous.

123
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,810
Fine, keep on being so.

124
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,080
Don't disturb me from taking the subway.

125
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,650
You don't own the subway.

126
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,320
I want to take it, so what?

127
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,010
What?

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,080
Okay, don't regret it.

129
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Don't worry, I'm not you.

130

Miss, excuse me, how did you get in?

131
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,980
Just download the mobile app.

132
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,130
Wait... Which one?

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,430
I wouldn't have come in anyway.

137
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Can you not be so naive?

138
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,930
And you have the nerve to say this.

139
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,400
It's all because you made me mad.

140
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,640
Shi Ying didn't even give you a car.

141
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
She's so stingy. I'll tell her off about this.

142
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,130
Don't. You can't change your mind whether you become rich or poor.

No matter what project he asks you to join,

you should at least do an investment risk assessment

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,400
I've been waiting for him outside his house the whole morning.

168
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
He's not answering the phone.

169
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,700
Did Mr. Lu get a new driver?

170
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,280
Is he going to fire me?

171
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,750
You think too much.

172
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,350
Check it for me.

173
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,520
Sure, let me investigate it.

174
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,370
<i>- Hello, Mr. Lu.
- Morning.</i>

175
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,530
Mr. Lu is here. I'll help you find out now. Bye.

176
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,520
<i>Mr. Lu.</i>

177
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,160
<i>- Mr. Lu.
- Morning.</i>

178
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

179
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,580
These are the documents you'll need for the meeting with the trust.

180
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,890
Please take a look.

181
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,120
Get my dry-cleaned suit and bring it to me.

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,910
Find me another pair of shoes.

183
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,220
Mr. Lu, if you don't mind me asking,

184
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,690
how did you get to work today?

185
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,710
What does that have to do with you?

186
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,540
Go and get the stuff.

187
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,270
Okay, Mr. Zhang,

188
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,490
let's play golf this weekend.

189
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,710
All right, see you this weekend.

190
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,810
Ms. Shi.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,380
Ning Meng, this is the information on Phoenix Industry Samples.

192
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,980
Have a look.

193
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,820
Let's visit Joint Capital this afternoon.

194
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,160
Let's see if Mr. Lu is willing to invest with us.

195
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,020
We're asking Mr. Lu again?

196
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,150
Yes.

197
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,310
Ning Meng, you have been with Mr. Lu for three years.

198
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,070
You should be clear

199
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,130
that Joint Capital has a strong brand effect in this industry.

200
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,530
They also have many sources of funding.

201
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,770
Their relationship with limited partners is also more stable.

202
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,130
Of course, we Eaglestone have our own advantage.

203
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,820
I used to be a guarantor.

204
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,600
I was in touch with many companies.

205
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,240
I have many ways of getting projects.

206
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,650
When there are good projects,

207
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,880
I won't want to miss them.

208
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,960
As such, cooperating with Mr. Lu is the best solution.

209
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,840
- Okay, I'll take a look.
- Good.

210
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,730
It was recommended by a friend of mine.

211
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,820
Phoenix Industry Samples wants to do corporate transformation.

212
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,800
They are currently in the financial stage.

213
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,790
We would like to check if you are interested, Mr. Lu.

214
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,050
Currently, transforming and upgrading traditional manufacturing is a huge trend.

215
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,610
I'm quite interested.

216
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,270
I'll do some research on it first.

217
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,290
That's great.

218
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,470
Then, in these two weeks, let's do a joint due diligence assessment.

219
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,450
We will send Ning Meng.

220
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,650
However, Ning Meng lacks experience in terms of systematic on-site due diligence assessment.

221
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm thinking of sending someone to guide her.

222
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,610
Who should I send?

223
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,140
How about your side?

224
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,370
Mr. Ren?

225
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,970
My schedule is full.

226
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,300
Our department has a project that requires me to fly to Beijing and Guangzhou.

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,250
Mr. Lu, how about…

228
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,580
I suddenly remembered that my good friend Zeng Yuhang

229
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,340
happens to have a project to assess over there.

230
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,030
For this investigation,

231
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,610
why don't I go myself?

232
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,770
Then I can meet up with him.

233
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,040
That's great.

234
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,480
Mr. Lu, you are so experienced.

235
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,110
You only need a quarter of your full strength to guide our Ning Meng.

236
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,910
It takes less than a quarter.

237
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,610
One-tenth is enough.

238
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,410
<i>One-tenth, he said?</i>

239
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,750
<i>Why doesn't he cut himself into slices?</i>

240
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,780
I'm just thankful that he didn't say one percent.

241
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,750
<i>Mengmeng, is something wrong with you?</i>

242
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,460
<i>When you mentioned this boss in the past,</i>

243
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,790
<i>you were full of hatred and resentment.</i>

244
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,230
<i>Why do you seem</i>

245
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,530
<i>quite happy now?</i>

246
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:14,410
<i>Did you have Stockholm syndrome?</i>

247
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,300
Don't worry, I'm not sick.

248
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,350
I'm also not trying to understand him.

249
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,400
From a certain point of view,

250
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,480
I've improved. Right?

251
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,080
<i>Aren't you afraid that he'll instruct you to do this and that,</i>

252
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,230
<i>treating you as a maidservant?</i>

253
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
He probably won't.

254
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,100
Recently, I think he is not as annoying as before.

255
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,320
Moreover, he just learned his lesson in the past two days.

256
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,610
He should remember it for a long time to come.

257
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,150
Wait a minute, I need to get the door.

258
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,690
Coming!

259
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,780
Hello, Ning Meng.

260
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,090
Come with us tomorrow. We'll drive there.

261
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,100
My car is quite spacious.

262
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,870
I can take you with me.

263
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,540
However, you'll have to drive.

264
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,360
I am from the Project Department, not logistics.

265
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,100
Can't someone from the Project Department drive?

266
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,780
No, I'll get motion sickness.

267
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,570
What kind of reason is that?

268
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,510
In the past three years, you were frequently in my car.

269
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,900
Did you ever vomit then?

270
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
I swallowed it up.

271
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,500
Thank you, Mr. Lu. I have already bought the high-speed rail ticket.

272
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,210
- Thank you, Mr. Zeng. Rest early.
- Bye-bye.

273
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,810
I'll withdraw my words.

274
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,220
This guy just doesn't get it.

275
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,020
Let's listen to a groovy tune. Shake it, man!

276
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,560
<i>Hanghang, are you here yet?</i>

277
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,860
I thought she only talks to me like this.

278
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,290
She talks like this to everyone.

279
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,030
As if she's sick.

280
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,140
<i>[Phoenix]</i>

281
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm in the yard, I'm here.

282
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,950
Ning Meng.

283
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,810
You fit the look of a female investor.

284
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,560
Mr. Zeng, are you kidding me?

285
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,390
Hello, Mr. Lu.

286
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,870
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

287
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,790
Thank you for taking the long journey.

288
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,650
This is our general manager, Yuan Jie.

289
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,250
- I'm Lu Jiming, from Joint Capital.
- Mr. Lu.

290
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,000
- This is my good friend, Zeng Yuhang. He is also an investor.
- Hello.

291
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,780
Hello.

292
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,400
Mr. Lu, it's our pleasure to have you do the due diligence assessment personally.

293
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,790
Come in, please. Have a look.

294
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,440
Give me your luggage, I'll put it in the car.

295
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,170
Thanks.

296
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,560
This home textile factory was established by my father in the late nineties.

297
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,930
It started as a small workshop that only produces fabrics,

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
it now covers an area of ​​30,000 square meters and is an enterprise worth over 100 million yuan.

299
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,800
Ning Meng, you are standing so far away,

300
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,480
can you hear what Mr. Yuan is saying? Come over.

301
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,740
Mr. Lu, she's…?

302
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,970
Hello, I'm the analyst from Eaglestone Capital, Ning Meng.

303
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,920
Hello.

304
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,830
Mr. Lu, let's move to the exhibition hall.

305
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,680
Great, please lead the way.

306
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,140
You have to walk in front, listen more and see more.

307
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,790
Mr. Lu.
<i>[Phoenix Industry Samples]</i>

308
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,610
Currently, Phoenix Industry Samples
<i>[Phoenix Industry Samples]</i>

309
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,220
mainly supplies bedding to mid to low-tier hotels.

310
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,200
We hope that the financing this time can introduce automated production lines

311
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,250
and expand overseas markets.

312
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,260
Mr. Yuan, how certain are you about this corporate transformation?

313
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,830
I have studied in the States before.

314
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm relatively familiar with the state of the advanced technology and overseas market.

315
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,130
The original business philosophy and model of Phoenix

316
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,910
can no longer keep up with the new trends in the global market.

317
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,580
Mr. Yuan, your father was the one who took care of the business. Right?

318
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,990
Yes, my father worked hard for this factory all his life.

319
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,720
He got ill from overworking,

320
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,040
and sadly, he passed away last year.

321
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,630
I am his only child,

322
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,980
taking over his business.

323
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,950
Few young people nowadays are willing to take over the family business.

324
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,750
Especially a business like this with more than 20 years of history and thousands of employees.

325
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,270
It's not easy to manage.

326
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,420
Mr. Yuan, to do this at your young age is amazing.

327
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,680
Yet these are all merely glories of the past.

328
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,980
The Phoenix factory is old.

329
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,260
It's time for it to be reborn.

330
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,780
When my father was alive,

331
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,650
he didn't want to do this.

332
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,160
The factory was never expanded.

333
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,330
It's a pity.

334
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,650
Mr. Lu, this is the blueprint of the factory reconstruction.

335
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,420
I'm planning to upgrade the existing production workshops

336
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,150
to automated smart factories.

337
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,600
Introduce the latest Enterprise Resource Planning and Manufacturing Execution Systems,

338
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,670
improving overall operational efficiency.

339
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,020
Will this improve the quality of home textiles?

340
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,010
The biggest improvement is efficiency.

341
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,350
Labor is so expensive now

342
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,520
that productive capacity is being transferred to Southeast Asia.

343
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,580
We must also keep pace with the times, replacing labor with machines.

344
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,150
Can you look at where you're going?

345
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm fine.

346
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,750
Just take simple notes and sort it out later.

347
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,920
See you tomorrow, Mr. Yuan.

348
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,650
See you tomorrow.

349
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,640
See you tomorrow, Mr. Zeng.

350
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,270
Let's go, Ning Meng; get in the car.

351
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,430
No, my hotel is nearby.

352
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,450
I'll just walk over there.

353
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,940
We are a team. Why should we stay in two hotels? Isn't that troublesome?

354
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,310
Yes.

355
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,950
Well, Mr. Lu…

356
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,000
It's okay, it's convenient to be close.

357
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,750
Then I'll go first.

358
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,680
- Let's go, then.
- Okay.

359
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,580
Nice environment.

360
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,530
- Thanks.
- Mr. Lu, let me help you check in.

361
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,930
Okay.

362
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,320
How did this Phoenix book their hotels, huh?

363
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,830
They booked a five-star hotel for a freeloader like you.

364
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,670
Yet they booked a guesthouse for a hard worker like Ning Meng. Interesting.

365
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,450
Why can't I stay in a five-star hotel?

366
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,940
Do you want me to stay in a guesthouse?

367
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,310
Don't tell me you

368
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,630
have a soft spot for Ning Meng?

369
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,180
It's for work.

370
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,650
It's inconvenient if we are far apart.

371
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,260
What kind of work would require Ning Meng to come over in the middle of the night?

372
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,240
It's normal to have urgent matters at work. What's wrong with that?

373
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,630
Just shut up.

374
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,280
Mr. Lu, you're checked in.

375
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,590
- I'll bring you to your rooms.
- Great.

376
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,860
- This way, please.
- Great.

377
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,360
Fortunately, I brought mine.

378
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,230
Mr. Zeng.

379
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,140
<i>Hey, Ning Meng.</i>

380
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,180
Pack your bags and come here to stay.

381
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,600
Is something wrong?

382
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,910
The environment here is better.

383
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,620
Did Phoenix arrange this?

384
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,010
It's your Mr. Lu's arrangement.

385
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,290
He thinks that the hotel you're staying in isn't any good.

386
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,300
<i>He's afraid that you'll suffer.</i>

387
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,810
No need, Mr. Zeng.

388
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,390
Please tell Mr.

389
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,960
<i>Lu that I'm not under Joint Capital anymore.</i>

390
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,020
<i>I shouldn't take advantage of him.</i>

391
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,450
You don't have to come if you don't want to.

392
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,280
No appreciation.

393
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,900
Mr. Lu, thank you for your charity.

394
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,460
I don't need it.

395
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,330
Besides, I'm not the Prince of Peas,

396
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,610
<i>I can sleep comfortably on my bed in this small hotel.</i>

397
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,880
<i>I have other things to do,</i>

398
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,190
goodbye and good night.

399
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,920
- She hung up.
- Let her be.

400
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,980
Let's have a drink?

401
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,400
Go ahead, I'm busy here.

402
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,520
Okay, bye.

403
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,700
<i>[Phoenix Industry Samples]</i>

404
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,610
Mr. Lu, Miss Ning arrived earlier. She's already at the resource center.

405
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,130
Great.

406
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,620
Is Mr. Zeng not coming with you to check on the documents?

407
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,860
He has other business today.

408
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,580
I see.

409
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,520
Mr. Chen.

410
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,400
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu, shall we provide you with a separate office?

411
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,330
One with a better environment.

412
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,720
No, it's more efficient for both of us to work together.

413
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,400
This is fine.

414
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,650
All right.

415
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,790
All right, I'll bring you some coffee in a bit.

416
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,290
Thanks.

417
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,420
Mr. Lu, do you really want to work here?

418
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,760
What's wrong?

419
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,100
Can't I stay where you can stay?

420
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,590
Can you stand the dust here?

421
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,790
If you can't stand it, don't act tough.

422
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,350
I can live with smog, the dust here is nothing.

423
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,980
What are you reading?

424
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,580
Why are you reading their history?

425
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,900
Brainless.

426
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,440
When it comes to manufacturers, first read the financial report.

427
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,210
Have you interviewed Finance yet?

428
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,320
Yes.

429
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,840
It's dusty.

430
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,970
You should first look at the receivables, bad debts, and asset efficiency.

431
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,780
Combine that with the results of the interview.

432
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,190
Compare them and see if there's anything fishy.

433
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,780
Okay.

434
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,830
You don't know anything, yet you want to do this project.

435
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,010
I wonder what Shi Ying taught you.

436
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,800
You say I'm not suited to work on projects.

437
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Yet you are teaching me how to do a due diligence assessment.

438
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,040
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

439
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,480
I seem to hear someone got slapped on his face.

440
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,350
Can't you tell?

441
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm doing all these so that you can avoid being embarrassed or criticized

442
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,130
by your temporary boss.

443
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,820
I don't want people to think that my mentee is lousy.

444
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,750
Okay.

445
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,860
Then please have a look. How should this part be compared?

446
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,980
First of all, you need to look at their financial reports

447
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,090
and cash flow capabilities.

448
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Next, look at their fixed assets.

449
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,090
Compare them carefully.

450
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,650
This one.

451
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,950
Then the next year.

452
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,750
Make no mistake.

453
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,350
I'm afraid you can't see clearly.

454
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,860
Mr. Lu, are you going for lunch?

455
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,420
Yeah, I'm a little hungry.

456
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,030
Do you have any requirements for lunch?

457
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,160
No. I'll eat what you provide.

458
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,390
We will serve the best to you.

459
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,720
Our leader said to arrange for you individually.

460
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,550
Arranged individually?

461
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,140
It's just two of us.

462
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,160
Do we have to eat separately?

463
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,280
We can discuss it over lunch.

464
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,430
It's all right. I'll eat at the cafeteria.

465
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,060
- Mr. Lu, so...
- I'll eat at the cafeteria, too.

466
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,820
Mr. Lu, the cafeteria is over there.

467
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,970
Why didn't you say it sooner?

468
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,190
This, please.

469
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,210
We are late. There's not much food left in the cafeteria.

470
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,610
Why don't you get Mr. Chen to take you out to eat?

471
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,900
Forget about it.

472
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,550
What if he arranged a feast for me?

473
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,850
What a waste of time.

474
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,760
That's true.

475
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,680
It would be a pickle if you realized the project is problematic

476
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,200
after enjoying a feast from them.

477
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,020
Even if they treat me to one hundred feasts,

478
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,580
I won't invest in a company that I shouldn't.

479
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,980
What a good work ethic.

480
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,600
Please.

481
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,110
Thank you.

482
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,930
Can you really swallow these?

483
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,120
Why not? Aren't all cafeterias like this?

484
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,170
Why are you laughing?

485
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,160
I thought of a joke.

486
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,070
What kind of joke?

487
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,090
There is a father and son.

488
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,460
They are both drunkards.

489
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,850
One day, they went out to buy wine together.

490
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,720
One of them accidentally stumbled on the road and spilled the wine.

491
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,460
The father is very smart.

492
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,770
He responded quickly by lying on the ground

493
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,490
and slurping up the wine on the ground.

494
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,220
The son was stupid and slow to respond.

495
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,490
The father then scolds his son,

496
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,680
"You fool, what are you waiting for?"

497
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,100
"Come and drink!"

498
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,910
"What's the matter? Do you want your mother to cook you some dish to go with the wine?"

499
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,440
I know you're talking about me.

500
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,360
Those who stare and wait are silly boys.

501
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,010
- What's that?
- My secret seasoning.

502
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,220
Did you bring it here on purpose?

503
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,610
It's always in my suitcase.

504
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,850
This is delicious.

505
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,970
Just by pairing it with rice,

506
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,010
I can eat three bowls of rice.

507
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,470
This is so delicious.

508
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,190
It's so good.

509
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,930
Let me try it.

510
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,890
How's it?

511
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,540
It's not bad.

512
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,570
Do you still have any jokes?

513
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,030
There was someone who loved to sing,

514
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,260
and he felt that he had a melodious voice.

515
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,310
Whenever he sang, his neighbor would cry.

516
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,130
He thought his neighbor was moved by him.

517
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,380
One day, he sang again and the neighbor cried again.

518
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,650
He was very proud, and he asked the neighbor,

519
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,760
"Were you moved by my singing voice?"

520
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,780
Then the neighbor wiped away his tears and said,

521
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,530
"Dude, let me tell you,

522
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:45,280
I used to have a screaming donkey which was very close to me."

523
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,890
But it got lost."

524
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:50,090
"Whenever I hear your voice, I will remember it."

525
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,070
"Because both of your voices are so similar."

526
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,590
How come I didn't know you're so good at telling jokes?

527
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,320
You don't know a lot about me.

528
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:08,300
This meal is really average,

529
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,780
but your jokes go well with the food.

530
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,530
Have some more then.

531
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,240
Add some more of this.

532
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,930
Buy me a few more cans.

533
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,490
Can I claim reimbursement?

534
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,470
You're so stingy.

535
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,550
The atmosphere in our factory is getting weirder and weirder.

536
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,900
Yes.

537
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,070
It was fine when the former boss was here.

538
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,600
Yes, the new boss says a lot of stuff that we don't understand.

539
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,510
He thinks he's amazing just because he studied abroad.

540
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,030
He's changing things so much that the factory is almost unrecognizable.

541
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,080
Really.

542
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,040
Eat.

543
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:46,870
<i>[Phoenix]</i>

544
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,000
<i>[Phoenix]</i>

545
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,100
Mr. Lu, did you hear the complaints from the employees?

546
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,000
We have to look at the bigger picture.

547
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Yuan Jie seems like a hard worker.

548
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,300
- I can see that he is anxious to improve the factory.
- That's true.

549
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,200
It may be a lot of pressure for a son to inherit his father's business.

550
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,300
What's wrong?

551
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,800
I forgot to bring my secret seasoning.

552
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
- I'll retrieve it.
- Forget it.

553
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,500
Isn't that embarrassing?

554
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,600
Tell me another joke. Come.

555
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,000
Once upon a time, there was a fool who loved to listen to jokes...

556
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,800
I understand what you said.

557
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Thank you.

558
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
- It's my job.
- All right.

559
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Be on your way back then.

560
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,800
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

561
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,900
- Mr. Lu.
- Is the interview done?

562
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,700
Ms. Han is the last one today.

563
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Great.

564
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,300
Mr. Lu, once the production line has been upgraded with an intelligent system,

565
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,900
they will need fewer workers.

566
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Would that lead to mass layoffs?

567
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Isn't there an employee placement program in Mr. Yuan's plan?

568
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,900
In reforms, there will always be sacrifices.

569
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,800
It's inevitable.

570
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,900
Let's go through all the data first. Then we will focus on assessing the things that can't be seen.

571
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,200
Ms. Shi also called me today about the progress, and I've reported to her.

572
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,500
From the current situation, there shouldn't be any problems.

573
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't be too happy yet.

574
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,900
Due diligence assessment is a prudent investigation.

575
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,600
It's fine to be meticulous.

576
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,500
I understand.

577
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,800
When I go back, I will put the interview results and the data for comparison.

578
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,600
I'll see if it matches.

579
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Seems like you still have some brains.

580
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,800
That's a lot of data, though. Can you finish it?

581
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,400
I can stay up for a night.

582
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,700
No problem.

583
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,700
Forget it. I'll go to your place.

584
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
Let's go.

585
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
What are you thinking?

586
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm afraid you can't do it alone,

587
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
so I want to help you.

588
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,300
Are you sure?

589
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,600
My place is not a five-star hotel.

590
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,800
What does that matter?

591
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,200
I'm here to work, not for vacation.

592
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,000
<i>[Guesthouse]</i>

593
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,600
This way, please.

594
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,800
It's pretty shabby here.

595
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,800
You are the one who wanted to come.

596
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,100
What kind of chair is this? It's so hard.

597
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
It's a problem with the chair.

598
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Stop talking nonsense.

599
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,200
Is there anything to eat?

600
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,500
Let's get something to eat and get down to work.

601
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Why don't I get you a takeout?

602
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
Why waste that time?

603
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,600
Are you sure you want to eat this?

604
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,400
Do you think I haven't had this before?

605
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Ning Meng, you are so petty.

606
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm just having one box of your stuff.

607
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,900
I'll get you a few boxes when we go back.

608
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
It's my treat.

609
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
- Ning Meng.
- It's all right.

610
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
It's just that my eyes are sore.

611
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
I just need some eye drops.

612
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,000
Mr. Lu, please take a look here.

613
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,400
Regarding the bad debt risk.

614
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,000
Mr. Lu.

615
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
What is it?

616
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,400
The corporate receivables range from one to three years.

617
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,100
Some businesses may play with the age in the accounts.

618
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
What's wrong?

619
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,500
Keep asking... Why do you care?

620
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Is the bad debt reserve ratio appropriate?

621
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
About this?

622
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Sometimes, you can't just look at the surface.

623
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,700
On the accounts, they are making money, but the business is actually losing money.

624
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,500
Look at this line. Here.

625
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Moth!

626
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,400
- It's a big one.
- Ning Meng, hit it.

627
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
It's flying away.

628
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Don't move.

629
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,500
- Where is it?
- Don't move.

630
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,000
- Why did you hit me?
- I'm sorry.

631
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,700
I was hitting the bug. I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

632
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,000
Did you get it?

633
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
I don't know.

634
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,900
Look for it.

635
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,600
It's there.

636
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,100
Ning Meng, come on, hit it.

637
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,000
I can't reach it. You should do it.

638
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
- Well…
- You are tall.

639
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,600
Why don't you wait for it to fly down before you hit it?

640
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,200
Are you afraid of bugs?

641
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,600
What are you saying?

642
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
Why should I be afraid of it?

643
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,300
Did I get it?

644
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,700
- It's dead.
- Quickly throw it away.

645
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,700
Use your hand.

646
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
- My god, the documents!
- Hurry up!

647
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,900
- Ning Meng, let's go.
- Hurry up.

648
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,500
Take them away.

649
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
Don't let them get wet.

650
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,200
Take it out first.

651
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,900
Oh my god.

652
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,100
What happened?

653
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,000
What are you doing?

654
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Take this.

655
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,200
Give it to me.

656
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,400
The computer.

657
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,600
- Give it to me.
- Take it.

658
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,600
Dry your head, or else water will get in.

659
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,100
Your head is full of water, not mine.

660
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Why don't you move to my place tonight?

661
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,000
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,700
♫ <i>That could predict when we meet?</i> ♫

663
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
♫ <i>Perhaps it's going to be a sight</i> ♫

664
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:37,200
♫ <i>If we could walk ahead of time</i> ♫

665
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,500
♫ <i>We refused to be defined, be discriminated</i> ♫

666
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,800
♫ <i>And be labeled</i> ♫

667
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,200
♫ <i>To be the best of me</i> ♫

668
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,000
♫ <i>To meet the best of you again</i> ♫

669
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,600
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

670
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,600
♫ <i>No matter how reluctant you feel</i> ♫

671
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,000
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫

672
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:15,800
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

673
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,800
♫ <i>Watching the fallen leaves, listening to the wind</i> ♫

674
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,300
♫ <i>Saying that all colors have luster</i> ♫

675
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,500
♫ <i>Don't want to be bullied, to be brushed off</i> ♫

676
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ <i>And to be treated like a fool</i> ♫

677
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,000
♫ <i>Breaking through the laws of the world</i> ♫

678
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,900
♫ <i>And reconnect with the sacred heart</i> ♫

679
00:43:53,900 --> 00:44:01,600
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

680
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,400
♫ <i>Every little thing we gain in life</i> ♫

681
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,400
♫ <i>Comes with huge obstacles</i> ♫

682
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,800
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

683
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
♫ <i>There's no so-called happy ending</i> ♫

684
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,000
♫ <i>Just make your decision with bravery</i> ♫
