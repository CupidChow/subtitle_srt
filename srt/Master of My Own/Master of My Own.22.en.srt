3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,860
Can I tell you about my relationship with her?

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,660
If you want to tell me, I'm all ears.

5
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,890
After we graduated, I went overseas with her.

6
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,580
In the beginning, we were having a tough time.

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,950
We couldn't get used to life there. We were also short of money.

8
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,260
We started quarreling every day because we thought we had sacrificed more for each other.

9
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,240
Because we suffered as we loved each other.

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,410
After that, a son of a wealthy immigrant started to pursue her aggressively.

11
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,330
You may not know how appalling the methods these rich guys used to win a girl's heart.

12
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,120
After that, she started seeing that rich guy.

13
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,170
At first, she couldn't let me go.

14
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,730
When I found out, I laid everything on the table,

15
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,390
while she chose that rich guy.

16
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,270
I went through a very hard time.

17
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,500
Her betrayal had changed my life.

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,220
From that moment, I started spending my time and energy on my work.

19
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,520
I wanted to achieve something.

20
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,620
I wanted to prove myself.

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,420
And I already did it.

22
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,980
All these years, I never dated anyone.

23
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,520
It was to the point where I think I no longer believed in love.

24
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,820
Until...

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,490
I met you again.

26
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,190
Every time I see you, you remind me of my old self.

27
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,880
That person believed in many things.

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,630
He was willing to believe that the world was beautiful and pure.

29
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,650
He believed that original aspirations would come true someday.

30
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,930
Thank you for helping me find my ability to love again.

31
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,470
Ning Meng, will you be my girlfriend?

32
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,060
All right.

33
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,020
You can stop here.

34
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,590
You must take care. You must stay safe.

35
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,660
Call me if there's anything.

36
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,900
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

37
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,870
You, on the other hand, stop working all the time.

38
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,790
You need to take action on certain things quickly.

39
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,510
I think you and Ning Meng are pretty compatible.

40
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,820
Have you noticed you were more relaxed when you were with her?

41
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,400
Feelings expressed from the heart can't trick anyone.

42
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,600
Mingming, face your heart directly.

43
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,370

The first batch of pre-sale is sold out.

Don't worry. I've kept it for you.

I don't have to worry when you're around.

53

Does Mobi have any plans for the future?

54
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,780
I'm pretty optimistic about Mr. Lin's business.

55
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,760
When the time is right, I want to contact the securities firm to coach them

56
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,310
and see if they're able to issue an initial public offering

65
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,740
What project?

66
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,140
Lehui.

67
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,670
It's an enterprise specializing in manufacturing small household electrical appliances.

68
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,520
<i>[Lehui Donlim Home Appliances Introduction]</i>
My friend introduced this to me. I think it's pretty good.

69
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,650
Besides, they're currently launching a multi-functional pot and looking for funding.

A female entrepreneur?

72

It's hard to come by.

73
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,820
Ms. Liu designs all the company's products herself.

74
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,230
I think it's very unique compared to the rest in the same industry.

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,980
Okay.

76
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,830
Give it a shot.

77
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,350
Ms. Shi, if Lehui is a good choice to be invested in, can I handle this independently?

78
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,550
Just like Mobi finding their own capital.

79
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,220
Just do it.

80
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,110
- All right, I'll get back to work first.
- Okay.

No, I'm not.

I've already made myself clear.

I feel at ease instead.

86
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,660
Artists sure have their way of talking.

87
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,050
I can only advise you as a friend. Don't say what you don't mean.

88
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,330
I guess Meng was the one who spoke on point.

89
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,400
You have to face your feelings directly, Lu Mingming.

90
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,950
Can't you see I'm facing my feelings now?

91
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,490
That means you admit that you like Ning Meng.

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,680
I'll give you one important piece of information.

97
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,610
I think Ning Meng has feelings for you, too.

98

How do you know?

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,860
Do you believe me?

100
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,890
Really?

101
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,450
Why are you smiling?

102
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,230
Don't be too happy so soon.

103
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,670
That was a long time ago.

104
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,660
We don't even know how she feels now.

105
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,700
You better take action quickly.

106
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,440
It's a piece of cake.

107
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,010
Do I need to make a big deal out of this?

108
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,190
How are you sure you have no rival?

109
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,700
Ning Meng is doing a lot better than before.

110
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,160
Many guys are pursuing her, too.

111
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,010
You better not let other guys get to her first.

112
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,090
He wouldn't dare.

113
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,770
Who?

114
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Nobody can.

115
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,570
Mr. Lu, is something troubling you?

116
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,580
Song, have you ever pursued a girl before?

117
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,650
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

118
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,300
Just answer me.

119
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,900
When it comes to this thing, you're asking the right person.

120
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,940
You need to show your strengths when you're pursuing a girl.

121
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,500
Look at my strength. I have a car.

122
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
How convenient it is to pick people up.

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Who did you pick up with my car?

124
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,720
No one. I was just giving an example.

125
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,670
When you're pursuing a girl, you need to maintain the proper distance.

126
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,890
You should know when to advance and when to back off.

127
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,750
You have to master the distance.

128
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,020
If she's too far, you won't be able to catch up with her.

129
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,070
If she's too near, there'd be a rear-end collision.

130
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,170
After you have identified your target, don't ever change it casually.

131
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,520
You'll get beaten if you pursue more than one girl.

132
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,190
Wait. Are you talking about pursuing girls?

133
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,370
It's almost similar.

134
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,830
It's the same as driving a car.

135
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,930
It's all technical work.

136
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,620
If you don't understand, don't be ashamed to ask.

137
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,720
Just focus on driving.

138
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,130
Come in.

139
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,100
Mr. Lu, here's the information about the alternative projects you wanted.

140
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,320
Xiaoyang, I have something to ask you.

141
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,910
What kind of gift do you think would make a girl happy?

142
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,300
Handbags work all the time.

143
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,080
I love bags.

144
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,280
No, not bags.

145
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
Not bags?

146
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
Then that'll depend on who you're buying for.

147
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,100
If you're buying it for a co-worker, a bag will be fine.

148
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,920
If it's for a female client, it'll have to be related to the business affairs.

149
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,230
If it's your girlfriend, you'll have to be more romantic.

150
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
Let's put this aside for now.

151
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,780
Make a reservation at a restaurant tonight.

152
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,810
What kind of cuisine would you like?

153
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,850
Never mind, then. I'll make the reservation myself.

154
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,470
Get back to work.

155
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,430
Mr. Lu, are you seeing someone?

156
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,150
What are you saying?

157
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,750
I'm busy with the project.

158
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,570
- All right.
- Close the door.

159
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,460
Hello? I'd like to make a reservation.

160
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,710
Tonight. Two people.

161
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,310
At 7:00.

162
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,840
I want a private room for two with a night view.

163
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,670
As for the dishes, I'll go for the chef's recommendations.

164
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,350
Allergies?

165
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,300
How about this? I'll order when I'm there.

166
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,040
Also, I'll order a bouquet of flowers and have it sent over early.

167
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,490
Help me put it in the room.

168
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,670
Mr. Lu, where are you going?

169
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,470
Give the car key to me.

170
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
You can go home now.

171
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,350
See you, Mr. Lu.

172
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,820
Why is he acting strange?

173
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,580
We'll find out after a couple of days.

174
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,430
Every time he doesn't need me to drive him, he definitely has a huge deal going on.

175
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,310
<i>[Eaglestone Capital]</i>
- Hello, Mr. Lu.
- Hello, Mr. Lu.

176
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,520
Hello, Mr. Lu.

177
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,670
Mr. Lu?

178
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,420
Is Ms. Ning not here?

179
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,210
She went out.

180
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,310
Is there anything I can help you with?

181
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,070
I...

182
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,620
Mr. Lu.

183
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,640
Are you looking for Ning Meng?

184
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,600
No, I came to discuss some projects with you.

185
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,520
All right. Let's talk in my office.

186
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,200
Okay.

187
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,510
Lehui Appliances?

188
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,860
That's right.

189
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,150
The founder of this project is a woman.

190
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,910
It's also targeting the market of female consumers.

191
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,380
I have a suggestion.

192
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,740
Why don't we find a female to take charge of this project?

193
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,630
Mr. Lu, what a coincidence.

194
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,540
Ning Meng also set her eyes on this project.

195
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,440
Really? Not bad.

196
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,810
Her insight will be catching up with mine soon.

197
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,920
Mr. Lu, you may be a step behind.

198
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,940
Ning Meng has already approached them.

199
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,390
This time, I promised to let her take over independently and find the funds herself.

200
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,870
So if you're interested, you have to see Ning Meng.

201
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,910
It's not up to me to decide.

202
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,280
So is she inspecting the project today?

203
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,570
She might be back when working hours are almost over.

204
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:58,550
Mr. Lu, I can ask Ning Meng to reserve some shares for you if you're interested.

205
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,850
You don't have to do that.

206
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,860
Just let Ning Meng do her best for this project.

207
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,680
Ms. Shi, I came here with several promising projects besides Lehui's project.

208
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,950
That's great.

209
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,910
Since you have time, I'm all ears.

210
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,670
<i>[Open the Inspiration Box]</i>
Ms. Ning, the Mobi Fitness you invested in has now become a hit.

211
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:34,270
So I was surprised to hear that you're interested in our unknown small household appliances.

212
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,280
Mobi itself has a line of great products.

213
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,250
I was lucky to have invested in them.

214
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,610
- You're too modest.
- Not at all.

215
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,040
Come and take a look

216
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,350
at our main product, Donlim Pot.

217
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,950
This pot doesn't need a stove.

218
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,970
You can steam, cook, fry, and deep fry food.

219
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,690
You can have a hotpot and grilled meat with it.

220
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,960
No matter what you want to eat, this pot can take care of it all.

221
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,260
It's very convenient.

222
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,780
The product design looks really good.

223
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,850
How did you even think of this?

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,680
To be honest, it's not my first time starting a business.

225
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,090
My ex-husband and I manufactured OEM appliances.

226
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,950
You can say we built up from nothing.

227
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,260
I had to quit because I was pregnant.

228
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,140
But as a homemaker, we spend so much time and energy making meals.

229
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,340
Gradually, I came up with the idea of making my own kitchen appliances.

230
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,060
But my ex-husband didn't support the idea.

231
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,210
We divorced after a while.

232
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,380
But I used all of my experience in product design.

233
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,080
I want to provide some comfort and convenience to those like me,

234
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,310
who have to spend a lot of energy on cooking.

235
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,730
That's great.

236
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,250
Of course, if a family can make meals together with this pot,

237
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,670
making a meal will no longer be a hard job

238
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,330
but a happy and pleasant thing to do. Right?

239
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,760
Ms. Liu, you make me feel that I've made the right choice.

240
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,090
Thank you.

241
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,950
Ms. Ning, this way, please.

242
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:17,460
Ms. Liu, I'd like to know how you intend to use the funds you've raised.

243
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,430
I intend to invest in the early stage of production.

244
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,730
I've prepared the funds for the cost of putting the products on the market.

245
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,490
I got this fund from the division of property after the divorce with my ex-husband.

246
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,750
Because of his business, it takes time to divide the property.

247
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,550
That's why I needed investment.

248
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,790
I just want to confirm.

249
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,150
I think the payment due date is clearly stated in your divorce agreement, right?

250
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,430
Of course.

251
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,110
My ex-husband has been a businessman for many years.

252
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,150
I'm sure he's an honest person.

253
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm glad to hear that.

254
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,850
It's been many years since I started a business.

255
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,160
I do feel a little scared with such a large financing project.

256
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,310
Don't worry.

257
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,060
I have some experience in capital management and operation.

258
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll do this together.

259
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,370
That's great.

260
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,920
I look forward to working with you.

261
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,730
Same here.

262
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,820
I think investment companies like ours

263
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,350
will become more specialized in the future

264
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,670
because every company focuses on different projects.

265
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,730
We can't be investing in every industry.

266
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,780
But I think these projects are particularly suitable for our—

267
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,590
Mr. Lu,

268
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,360
why don't we call it a day?

269
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,310
There are so many projects. I need time to think about all these investments.

270
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,100
Are there too many? I...

271
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,830
Ms. Shi, there are two projects I haven't discussed with you.

272
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,640
The thing is I have a date today. I'm sorry.

273
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,410
You're right about that. You should go now.

274
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,070
- Ms. Shi.
- Ning Meng, you're back.

275
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,080
You're here.

276
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,850
You're here, too?

277
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,950
I was discussing some projects with Ms. Shi.

278
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,010
Time flies. It's almost time to get off work.

279
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,700
Did it go smoothly?

280
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,770
It went pretty smoothly.

281
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,810
Ms. Liu of Lehui gave me the details. Take a look.

282
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,320
I'll check it later. You guys can talk, okay?

283
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,900
Okay, Ms. Shi. See you around.

284
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay, you guys can talk.

285
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,950
Why don't we leave, too?

286
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,710
We'll talk as we go.

287
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,120
Does Ms. Shi have a boyfriend now?

288
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,170
How did you know?

289
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,080
She told me she is going on a date.

290
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,710
When did you become such a busybody?

291
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,040
Mr. Lu, are you here to see me?

292
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,020
Are you hungry? Let's talk about it over dinner at a restaurant.

293
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,090
I'm sorry. I have to go home to complete the proposal.

294
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,060
Is it Lehui's project? Ms. Shi told me about it.

295
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,420
Ning Meng, I find your insights are becoming more perceptive like a good investor.

296
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,630
Wait! I'll put it in a different way.

297
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,660
You're an outstanding investor.

298
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,000
Thank you.

299
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,960
Are you really busy today?

300
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,760
What about tomorrow?

301
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,590
I have plans for tomorrow.

302
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,980
What about the day after tomorrow? I'm sure you're free on weekends?

303
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,950
Mr. Lu, what's the matter?

304
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,910
Well, there is something.

305
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,550
Stop beating around the bushes, then. Just be frank.

306
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,330
Be frank?

307
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,780
Out here? How can I be frank?

308
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,690
I think we should find a place and talk about it.

309
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,830
Ning Meng.

310
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,420
Senior?

311
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,390
I finished work earlier. So I rushed here to give you a surprise.

312
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,800
Here.

313
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,480
Thank you.

314
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,090
Hello there, Mr. Lu.

315
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,560
You're...

316
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,790
My junior has finally agreed to be my girlfriend.

317
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,400
<i>Will you be my girlfriend?</i>

318
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,020
<i>Senior, to tell you the truth</i>

319
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,110
<i>I just walked out from a heartbreak.</i>

320
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,150
<i>I'm still not ready.</i>

321
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,000
<i>I understand.</i>

322
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,800
<i>Thank you for being honest.</i>

323
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,140
<i>But what if I tell you that I don't mind?</i>

324
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,500
<i>I no longer want to waste my time...</i>

325
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,390
<i>because I think we're the best for each other.</i>

326
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,640
<i>Ning Meng, give me a chance...</i>

327
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,800
<i>to walk with you on the right path.</i>

328
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,800
<i>Is that okay?</i>

329
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,040
Mr. Lu?

330
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,320
Well, congratulations.

331
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,280
You've got what you wanted.

332
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,110
Then, I wish your love last forever and...

333
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,330
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

334
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,050
If there's nothing else, we'll take our leave, then,

335
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,660
Okay.

336
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,020
I'll see you around, Mr. Lu.

337
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,520
Come on.

338
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,520
Careful.

339
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,040
Bye-bye.

340
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,960
The project went well.

341
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,810
So I changed my flight and came back early.

342
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,410
I happened to pick up the car, so I gave you a surprise.

343
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,030
Do you like it?

344
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,810
I don't really know about cars.

345
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,830
But it looks pretty exquisite and pretty.

346
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,580
When I was working on Wall Street,

347
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,780
our boss at the investment company also drove this car.

348
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,550
Do you want to have Thai food tonight?

349
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,780
My friend recommended an authentic Thai restaurant at the Bund.

350
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,900
Do you want to try it tonight?

351
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,600
Sure.

352
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,530
But I have to go home early to do my proposal.

353
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,830
Okay, Ms. Ning, the model worker.

354
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,400
If you work this hard, does that mean I can retire and let you support me?

355
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,140
Mr. Su, for the role model of a model worker like you

356
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,020
to say this is too much.

357
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,000
<i>Mr. Lu, hello. I'm calling from the restaurant.</i>

358
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,820
<i>It's past your reservation time.</i>

359
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,200
<i>May I know if you're still coming?</i>

360
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Cancel it.

361
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,950
<i>What about the flowers?</i>

362
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,590
Throw them away.

363
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,070
Hello?

364
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,920
<i>So did you make it?</i>

365
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,040
She has a boyfriend now.

366
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,060
Enough. Stop running already.

367
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,570
You're not running a marathon here.

368
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,330
Tell me. Is she blind?

369
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,360
You can talk after you catch your breath.

370
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,780
I just can't let this go.

371
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,180
If you can't, just make it clear with Ning Meng.

372
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,700
She already has a boyfriend. What else can I say?

373
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,080
Just tell her that you like her and you want to be with her.

374
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,500
No.

375
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,700
You better not regret it.

376
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,680
If you don't tell her now, it'll be too late for you to tell her anything

377
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,320
when they're in a committed relationship.

378
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,970
Just hear me out.

379
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,140
I'm sure they just got together.

380
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,270
It's very likely that Ning Meng didn't think it through.

381
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,700
She may have done it on impulse.

382
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,370
You can still make it if you take action now.

383
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,960
Think about it. The longer you delay this, the better their relationship will be.

384
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,400
If you delay it for two days,

385
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,180
we won't know to what extent they've progressed.

386
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,040
You're right.

387
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,860
Are you going like that? You're not going to wash up?

388
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,200
Not a moment to waste.

389
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,210
All right.

390
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,710
See you.

391
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,200
Don't work all night even if you have to rush the proposal. Get to bed early, okay?

392
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
Okay.

393
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't forget the flowers.

394
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,120
I bought the local specialty, beef floss, for you too.

395
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,060
Can you carry all these? Do you want me to help you bring these up?

396
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,080
I can carry them all. It's not that much anyway.

397
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,600
Are you saying I'm giving too little?

398
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,340
No, that's not what I meant.

399
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,480
Look! I have great snacks and flowers. Thank you.

400
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,620
Okay.

401
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,790
Drive carefully.

402
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,790
Okay.

403
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,770
Sleep early, okay?

404
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,510
Okay.

405
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,350
Bye-bye.

406
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,650
<i>[Lu XX]</i>

407
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,310
Hello, Mr. Lu.

408
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,140
Mr. Lu.

409
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,230
What is it that's urgent?

410
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,380
I must tell you now.

411
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,120
Okay, what is it?

412
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,450
I...

413
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,000
I think judging a person is similar to handling a project.

414
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,540
You can't look at things from one perspective.

415
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,540
You need to inspect, observe, and compare more.

416
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,970
You can't put all your eggs in a basket. Understand?

417
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,870
Is this the urgent matter that you need to tell me?

418
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,520
I don't think Su Weiran is a reliable person.

419
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,200
Can you stop speculating on others?

420
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,790
Wait! What's so great about him?

421
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,760
Or did he buy you off over some small favors?

422
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,930
I told you not to get the project with him.

423
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,260
You're bound to him as a result, huh?

424
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,420
May I know who you are to ask these questions?

425
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,600
How does it concern you if he's a good or a bad person?

426
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,620
Don't you think you're a busybody?

427
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,330
Is this being a busybody?

428
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,100
How can I watch my...

429
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,740
my former secretary date someone unreliable?

430
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,340
You don't have to worry about this.

431
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,190
You should spare your time for Meng.

432
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,760
Meng left.

433
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,230
We were not in a relationship.

434
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,890
Are you venting your anger on me because you were dumped?

435
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,540
I wasn't dumped.

436
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,550
Meng and I were never in a relationship.

437
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,140
We're family and friends.

438
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,880
All right. I'll go if there's nothing else.

439
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,310
Wait. I really have something to tell you.

440
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,030
Then please be brief and specific.

441
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,810
I like you.

442
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,010
The reason I always wanted you to come back to become my secretary,

443
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,930
worked on strategic cooperation with Ms. Shi,

444
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,290
and always went against you was because I care about you.

445
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,160
I don't want to be separated from you.

446
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,500
Mr. Lu, what do you mean...

447
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,470
by saying these now?

448
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
I have to tell you how I feel.

449
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,930
Or else, I'll regret it.

450
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,930
The truth is I'm regretting it now.

451
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,960
I have a boyfriend now.

452
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,030
That's your business. Liking you is my business.

453
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,330
This isn't the same thing.

454
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,230
We'll take care of our own business, then.

455
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,320
I already have a boyfriend.

456
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,230
Please watch your conduct.

457
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,470
Does that mean we've missed our chance?

458
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,140
Yes.

487

490
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,310
For the children's program segment,

491
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,690
many companies are considering using light courses with low customer orders

492
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,540
as traffic entry to form a transformation.

493
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,730
Therefore, this is the most important thing to consider

494
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,360
for our Series B financing.

495
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,600
Mr...

496
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,770
Mr. Lu.

497
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,730
We need to consider the Series B financing.

498
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,100
Is there a problem with this conversion rate?

499
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,860
This report shows last month's data.

500
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,930
This month's data is not ready yet.

501
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,890
The market changes all the time.

502
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,460
The data should be updated, too.

503
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,200
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry. I was a little too late. I...

504
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,920
People make mistakes.

505
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,950
It's all right. You've worked hard.

506
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,140
That's all for today.

507
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,550
That's frightening.

508
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,140
What's happened?

509
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,660
Mr. Lu, you have a meeting with Mr. Wang.

510
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,760
Do you want to drive yourself there?

511
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,230
You'll drive.

512
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,440
Song.

513
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,090
Mr. Lu's mental state is different from yesterday's.

514
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,370
It looks like things didn't go well yesterday.

515
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,820
He doesn't yell at us anymore.

516
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,770
Did it go badly?

517
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:25,120
The is the calm before the storm.

518
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,670
Do you think Mr. Lu will fire you?

519
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,460
Lehui's LP has already been settled.

520
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,970
Mr. Liang with advertisement resources and Mr. Zhou with e-commerce resources

521
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,530
will invest in a ratio of one-to-one. Eaglestone Capital will be the GP.

522
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,690
We'll form a limited partnership and invest in Lehui,

523
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,260
which accounts for 20% of the shares.

524
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,030
Is Mr. Liang currently investing in the hotel business?

525
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,020
He's impressive.

526
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,770
What about Mr. Zhou?

527
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,320
Mr. Zhou wanted to invest in Mobi. But he didn't make it.

528
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,080
He met me several times when he was in Shanghai.

529
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,000
He's especially positive about the project I sent him.

530
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,830
All right. We've built up the structure.

531
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,930
Time to inform the Legal Department to prepare the partnership agreement.

532
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,730
Okay. Things have gone pretty smoothly this time.

533
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,520
Yes, I feel the same too.

534
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,100
It went so smoothly that I'm even feeling afraid.

535
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,970
What's there to be afraid of?

536
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,110
These are the resources you have accumulated bit by bit.

537
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,760
If you have time, go to Joint Capital.

538
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,610
The last time Mr. Lu was here, we didn't finish our discussion on some projects due to time constraints.

539
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,580
Why don't you go and find out about them?

540
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,630
Ms. Shi, I've been handling Lehui, so I won't be able to spare some time.

541
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,260
Why don't you send Ya?

542
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,360
What's wrong?

543
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,770
What happened?

544
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,760
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

545
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,100
Yes.

546
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,800
All right. I'll send Ya.

547
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,720
Hello, Ning Meng.

548
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,030
Are you free this afternoon? Let's have lunch together.

549
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,370
Don't you have to work?

550
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,590
I don't want to talk about it. I'm going to die from depression here.

551
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,860
What happened?

552
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,100
It's Mr. Lu. He's not being himself.

553
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,910
He no longer loses his temper and is distracted all the time.

554
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,070
<i>He looks lost all the time.</i>

555
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,970
<i>Meng, the whole company is lifeless because of him.</i>

556
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,940
<i>I miss the time when he always loses his temper.</i>

557
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,670
Now...

558
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,720
Based on your understanding of him,

559
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,140
what do you think is wrong with him?

560
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,980
What do you mean?

561
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,820
I've left the company for so long.

562
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,760
I don't know him that well anymore.

563
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,590
Do you think he was dumped?

564
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,050
<i>I remember most people behave this way when they are dumped.</i>

565
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:15,980
<i>Meng, he even asked me what gift does a girl like.</i>

566
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,880
<i>[Mr. Zhou]</i>

567
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,700
Xiaoyang, I have to go now. I have an incoming call.

568
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,180
I...

569
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,910
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

570
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,070
<i>Ning Meng, I want to confirm with you some details about the investment in the Lehui project.</i>

571
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,470
Sure, no problem.

572
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,260
Mr. Zhou.

573
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,970
Have a seat. I'll go one more round.

574
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,560
Okay.

575
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,390
Ning Meng,

576
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,640
I've been giving it a thought.

577
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,710
Why can't I invest directly...

578
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,230
in Lehui

579
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,590
and why do I have to invest through your company?

580
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,610
Mr. Zhou, because this is my investment project.

581
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,110
You can't invest directly.

582
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,010
Not necessarily.

583
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,060
I'm the real investor.

584
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,020
No establishment would invest their money so someone else would profit from it.

585
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,160
Mr. Zhou, investing in a project isn't just about the money.

586
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,400
There's still management, pooling of resources, integration,

587
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,940
and so on to consider after making the investment.

588
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,590
We're specialized in this aspect.

589
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,500
This explanation isn't convincing enough.

590
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,640
So what do you have in mind?

591
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,860
It's better for me to have the final say

592
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:10,960
by investing directly than giving you the money to invest in it. Right?

593
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,390
Ning Meng, how about this?

594
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:19,320
You said you were prepared to invest 20% of the company.

595
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,200
It's pretty simple. Give 10% to me.

596
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,760
I'll invest in it directly as a shareholder.

597
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,010
Of course, I won't get the 10% for free.

598
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,420
I'll give you a high commission fee

599
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,990
and bank it directly into your personal account.

600
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,020
Don't disclose it and accept it quietly.

601
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:49,170
Mr. Zhou, I don't think this is proper.

602
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:54,150
To me, it's extremely right for you

603
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,820
because this isn't a small commission, after all.

604
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,840
Mr. Zhou.

605
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,370
I think we should follow the previous investment structure.

606
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:28,260
It'll be the best for me, you, and the investment.

607
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,330
In that case, it's not right for me, then.

608
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,660
If you insist on doing this,

609
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,630
you'll have to find a new investor.
