3
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,930
I ran into someone today.

4
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,710
Who?

5
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,130
My senior sister.

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,100
What did you talk about?

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,000
She told me about her life in the United States

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,270
and showed me the photos of her child. Her child is adorable.

9
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,784
She said she felt guilty toward you.

10
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,510
Why did she bring that up?

11
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,380
I never blamed her.

12
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
Humans are creatures filled with desires.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,010
With so many temptations in society,

14
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,830
it's difficult not to cross the line.

15
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,580
But luckily, I have you.

16
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,388
You won't let me down, right?

17
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,720
Of course.

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Have this abalone.

19
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,020
The big one is yours.

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
Ning Meng.

21
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,690
What are you doing here?

22
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,201
I wonder if you could help me contact Mr. He again

23
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:15,320
and ask him how far the process is and how long it will take.

24
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,050
I asked him yesterday.

25
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,960
He told me he only needed the chairman's approval

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
before sending the document to me.

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
But I feel bad about rushing him.

28
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,340
Did Shuangxun make a move?

29
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,170
Well, I didn't hear them making any move now.

30
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,610
But they're really short of funds.

31
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,826
But I didn't expect Renning's procedures to take quite some time.

32
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:41,638
Could they have other ideas?

33
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,780
That won't be right for them to drag this on.

34
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,170
To be on the safer side,

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,780
Qinhe can only suspend trading to save itself

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,484
if Renning keeps delaying it.

37
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,940
I understand.

38
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,318
Why don't I call him now so he can make things clear?

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,456
Old He, am I bothering you?

40
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:12,520
<i>Not at all. What is it?</i>

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,070
I'm calling to ask about how things are going with Qinhe.

42
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,786
If there's any issue, you could talk to Mr. Lu about it over a meal.

43
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,850
<i>It'll be done soon.</i>

44
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,510
<i>The HQ had completed the procedure.</i>

45
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,410
<i>They're sending the document over now.</i>

46
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,746
<i>It's only a matter of one or two days for it to finalize.</i>

47

That's great.

48
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,320
I'll tell Mr. Lu to wait for your document, then.

49
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,350
<i>Ning Meng, it's not that I'm dragging this.</i>

50
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,220
<i>I'm even more anxious about this.</i>

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,056
<i>The efficiency of the HQ is beyond my ability.</i>

52
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>After I have received the written instructions, I'll handle it for you urgently.</i>

53
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,790
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

54
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,510
That's great. Thank you so much, Old He.

55
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,510
<i>It's nothing.</i>

<i>[to hold 30% stakes and bidding to acquire Qinhe]</i>
because they haven't been doing anything.

It turns out to be a joint venture with Renning Insurance.

Their appetite is insatiable.

96

<i>Did you mess up the favor Mengmeng asked of you?</i>

165
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,600
He Yueluan, why did you do that?

166
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
Remember what you told me?

167
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,700
Ning Meng, I understand how you feel right now.

168
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,500
Our agreement has always been under process.

169
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
Before any agreement is signed,

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,000
every verbal agreement is not valid.

171
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm sure you know about that.

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,500
He Yueluan, what are you saying?

173
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,300
You better settle this with Mengmeng. Or else I'll not finish with you.

174
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,200
You Qi, it's about our work. So don't interfere.

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,000
No, I can't allow him to bully you.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
Old He, are you listening to me?

177
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
I don't care about the agreement.

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
You must change it. Or else I'm not going to let it go.

179
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,400
You Qi, don't get involved recklessly.

180
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,090
It's not playing house. I can't just change it.

181
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,400
You never wanted to do this favor. Am I wrong?

182
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,200
You lied to Mr. Lu and me to stall time.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Ning Meng, we're in the same field.

184
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,200
She doesn't get it. But how could you not know?

185
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,100
Financial markets are unpredictable.

186
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,400
It's not something that I can control.

187
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm only a manager of the Shanghai branch.

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
I have superiors above me.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,800
This isn't something I can decide for myself.

190
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Why did you do that, then?

191
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
What do you get from doing this?

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Of course, he has benefits.

193
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
And it's not a small amount.

194
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
Am I right, Mr. He?

195
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,000
Ning Meng, you can't accuse me blindly.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm sure you know what you did in this matter.

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I don't care what you think.

198
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,500
He Yueluan.

199
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,300
So you used Mengmeng to acquire someone else's company?

200
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,100
What were you thinking?

201
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
Are you that crazy about money?

202
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,300
Is money all you think about?

203
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,900
- You're full of lies. Do you have a conscience?
- Shut up!

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,700
Do you know how much the monthly rent for this place is?

205
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you know how much your expenses a month are

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,500
for buying branded bags, branded clothes, food, and other things?

207
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
Have you earned a penny for these expenses?

208
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
I earned that money.

209
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,300
Who are you to say that I only care about money?

210
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
What do you mean by that?

211
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
Do you remember what you said when you tried to win my heart?

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,800
You Qi,

213
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,300
why do you think I worked so hard all these years?

214
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,600
It's all for you to have a better life.

215
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,300
But you,

216
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,800
you think it's only natural that I should sacrifice more

217
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,100
because you always think that I'm not worthy of you.

218
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,300
After so many years,

219
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,600
have you ever respected me?

220
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
Have you truly understood me?

221
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,800
Have you really cared about what I want?

222
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
You Qi,

223
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,200
it has been too tiring for me for the past few years.

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
I need a break.

225
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Let's break up.

226
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,400
<i>Lu Tianxing's surgery has ended.</i>

227
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
- He's going back to the ward.
- Let's go.

228
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
Miss, how is he?

229
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
Are you the patient's family?

230
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

231
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,300
We managed to save him. But he's still in a critical condition.

232
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,200
As for other details, the doctor will come and explain them to you.

233
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
You have to take note of this. The patient was given an anesthetic.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
So he might feel nauseated and want to vomit.

235
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,100
When that happens, you can just move him to the side slightly.

236
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,000
If there's anything, you can press the bell to call us.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,200
We'll get going, then.

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
- Okay.
- Thank you.

239
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Thank you very much.

240
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,100
Old Lu.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>The number you've dialed is switched off.</i>

242
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,600
What now? His phone is still switched off.

243
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,200
He was the one at fault.

244
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,600
Why did he break up with me?

245
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,200
Have some water first.

246
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Calm down.

247
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,400
How can I calm down, Mengmeng?

248
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,000
He used you and wanted to break up with me.

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
After being together for so many years,

250
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
why did he suddenly break up with me?

251
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
There, there.

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Mengmeng, what should I do now?

253
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Calm down first.

254
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,700
Your affairs shouldn't get mixed up with our work.

255
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,800
Perhaps he did it on a whim just now.

256
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Mengmeng,

257
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
I had a feeling that he had been planning this all this while.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,300
He wanted to use this matter as an excuse to break up with me.

259
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,500
You know what?

260
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,600
He had been paying attention to Qinhe all this while.

261
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,800
But that was before you came to see him.

262
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,600
He'd always pay attention to news on Qinhe.

263
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,800
He told me everyone was paying attention to it.

264
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,600
So I didn't care about it.

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,200
All right. Stop overthinking.

266
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Have a good night's sleep tonight, okay?

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,800
After I get to the bottom of this, we'll find a way to solve this.

268
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Mengmeng, you must find him.

269
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,400
I want to know why he did that.

270
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,300
He wasn't like this before.

271
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,400
He really wasn't like this.

272
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,700
Okay, I know.

273
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,800
Don't worry. I'll find him and ask him.

274
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,100
- Excuse me, who are you looking for?
- He Yueluan.

275
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm sorry. Mr. He is on a business trip.

276
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,300
- You can get back to work.
- Okay.

277
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Why are you here?

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Where's He Yueluan?

279
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,800
What's wrong? You look upset.

280
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Are you here to seek justice for your best friend who just had a breakup?

281
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
How did you know they broke up?

282
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
Did He Yueluan tell you that?

283
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,100
Or are you the reason that they broke up?

284
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,000
It's easy to guess.

285
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,900
I could already guess.

286
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,200
Can your insensible good friend of yours

287
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,000
have a happy ending with Mr. He?

288
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Chen Xiaoyi, who are you to question their relationship?

289
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,100
What does this have to do with you?

290
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,000
You seemed to be waiting for this day to happen.

291
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,590
It has nothing to do with me.

292
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,800
But if you keep making a scene, I'll call security.

293
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,700
- Where's He Yueluan?
- I don't know!

294
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,500
Do you truly know him?

295
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,000
After so many years of being in a relationship, he could just turn against her.

296
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
After agreeing to cooperate,

297
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
he betrayed us just as he turned his back.

298
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,500
Do you think someone like this would treat you sincerely?

299
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,400
If I were you,

300
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
I wouldn't be pleased with myself.

301
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,400
Why? You have no appetite?

302
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
Why don't I get something else for you?

303
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,400
It's okay.

304
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't feel like eating.

305
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,204
<i>[He Yueluan]
[No response]</i>

306
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,200
You still can't find He Yueluan?

307
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
He doesn't even have the guts to confront us now.

308
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I'm regretting it now.

309
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,000
I shouldn't have talked to He Yueluan that way in front of You Qi.

310
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
She's innocent.

311
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,600
I shouldn't have gotten her involved.

312
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,600
You Qi and He Yueluan have their own problems.

313
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,400
It's not related to you.

314
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,100
You don't have to be responsible for everything.

315
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,400
Besides, to look at this fairly,

316
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
it may not be a bad thing for You Qi to break up now.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
It's better to break up if they're not suitable.

318
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,300
To cut losses in time.

319
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,600
It's better than suffering for the rest of her life, right?

320
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
You should help her come around.

321
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll watch You Qi.

322
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,800
But in this case, it was He Yueluan who betrayed us first.

323
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,700
I know she's your best friend and Lu Jiming was your boss.

324
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,400
Of course, you'd think this way.

325
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,600
But business is like a battlefield.

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
There's always deceit in businesses.

327
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Everyone has their own stand.

328
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,000
When you stand in your position to seek benefits,

329
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,700
you'll definitely harm other people's interests, too.

330
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
I know.

331
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,400
I think he had colluded with Shuangxun from the beginning.

332
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm sure there's something shady

333
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
behind their attack on Qinhe.

334
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is only your speculation.

335
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,700
You have no proof, right?

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,800
All right. Let's stop talking about it.

337
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Calm down and enjoy your meal.

338
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,200
Eat more. Your health is more important.

339
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,800
Only then will you have the energy to accompany You Qi.

340
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
Is Mr. Lu doing okay lately?

341
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I meant Mr. Lu Senior. Is he okay?

342
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,800
He survived, but he's still under observation.

343
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,200
He is also a veteran in the business world.

344
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
This is unexpected to see.

345
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Mr. Lu must be worried, right?

346
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,500
I think he'll be at the hospital to accompany Mr. Lu during this time.

347
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,800
You used to meet him regularly before.

348
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sure you're worried, too.

349
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,800
Why don't I accompany you to visit him?

350
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,300
Okay.

351
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,400
If you don't have any appetite, eat more salad.

352
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,600
Then I'll eat the meat.

353
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
Mr. Lu.

354
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,400
Mr. Lu, Ning Meng and I are here to visit your father.

355
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Madam Liu.

356
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
Ning.

357
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,900
How's Mr. Lu?

358
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
He hasn't regained his consciousness.

359
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,700
The doctor said he is still in a critical condition.

360
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Hello, Ma'am.

361
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm Ning Meng's boyfriend, Su Weiran.

362
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,000
I wish Mr. Lu a speedy recovery.

363
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
Okay.

364
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,500
Thank you.

<i>[Lyuye Technology]</i>

366
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,400
Mr. Lu, don't worry.

367
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm sure it's hard on you

368
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,000
that such a thing happened.

369
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,484
I don't need you to be concerned about my family matters.

370
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,800
I know you hold prejudice against me.

371
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,700
But I'm pretty impressed by you.

372
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,000
Joint Capital has many promising projects.

373
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It'll be a pity...

374
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
if they're out of funds.

375
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,600
If you have trouble with cash flow,

376
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,400
I can take over some of the projects.

377
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
Thank you for your concern.

378
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
But I don't need your help.

If you need my help,

380
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,500
you can tell me anytime.

381
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Mr. Lu used to be in high spirits before.

382
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,800
I didn't expect him to look dejected in just several days.

383
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,600
I hope Mr. Lu Senior will be okay.

384
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,200
There's nothing much that we can do.

385
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,000
We can only do our best to help out.

386
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,600
The only way for me to help him is to find He Yueluan.

387
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,000
He's the only breakthrough I can think of now.

388
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,200
You must be cautious, then.

389
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,800
Tell me if there's anything.

This is indeed the only good news I've heard during the past few days.

You asked if I truly knew He Yueluan.

I thought about it.

414
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,200
It's true that I don't know what he's thinking sometimes.

415
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
So I asked him.

416
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,400
Guess what he said to me?

417
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,900
He said it was a casual fling

418
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,200
and he was just fooling around.

419
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,300
He told me not to take it seriously.

420
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Guess what else he told me?

421
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,800
He said if I exposed this matter,

422
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,100
he'd make sure I have no place in this field.

423
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,000
So?

424
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Is this what you want to tell me?

425
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm not interested in your conflicts.

426
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,600
Ning Meng, do you still see me as your enemy?

427
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
It looks like you don't know He Yueluan at all.

428
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
He doesn't have any bottom line.

429
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,400
What do you mean?

430
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,000
Do you think your sixth sense is accurate?

431
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,400
You managed to find out about our affairs.

432
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,600
I was only there to take a bullet for him.

433
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,100
The true enemy of you and your best friend is Quan Ruru.

434
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,600
I just found out that she's the real mistress.

435
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You've met her before.

436
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
When?

437
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Do you still remember the time your best friend crashed the KTV?

438
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,000
Quan Ruru was there that night, too.

439
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,400
<i>He Yueluan, I'll take her back first.</i>

440
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
<i>You better behave yourself.</i>

441
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,600
Your bestie saw her.

442
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,000
But both of you put your focus on me that night.

443
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
You completely ignored Quan Ruru's existence.

444
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,000
Other than the KTV, you guys did meet up again. Right?

445
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,700
She was also there. At Jiangnanchun Restaurant.

446
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,200
All of you came out of the private room.

447
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
She was holding on to someone else.

448
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes, there was that one time.

449
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,700
He Yueluan drank too much that day. So I helped him walk.

450
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Quan Ruru was helping Mr. Zhao of Shuangxun.

451
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,600
I thought they were a pair that day.

452
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
When I think about it,

453
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,400
this woman is truly scheming.

454
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,600
She didn't even reveal any flaws.

455
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,600
So that means you've colluded with Shuangxun from that day.

456
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
Am I right?

457
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Shuangxun acquired stakes openly,

458
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,200
while Renning Insurance helped in the dark.

459
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Something like that.

460
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
What about Caihuang Capital?

461
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,200
What part did Jin Haiyang play?

462
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,600
- Bring up the stock price?
- Enough already. Stop trying to dig for information.

463
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,500
That's all I know.

464
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,400
As for the details, He Yueluan won't even tell me.

465
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
The reason I asked you out is to tell you

466
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,600
that you got the wrong target.

467
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,800
He Yueluan tricked us all.

468
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,800
He's a scum who fooled us.

469
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,000
He Yueluan may have fooled us.

470
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,800
But I don't pity you.

471
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,000
You're not like us.

472
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,400
You deserved it.

473
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
You failed to bring He Yueluan down.

474
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Or maybe he has something on you.

475
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,600
That's why you came to see me.

476
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,600
You're paying. I'm leaving now.

477
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
Wait.

478
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Don't you want to know where He Yueluan is now?

479
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,400
You Qi and He Yueluan stay in a rented apartment, right?

480
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,300
But He Yueluan bought an apartment for Quan Ruru.

481
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,000
And that apartment is right next to the neighborhood where You Qi stays.

482
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,070
<i>Coming.</i>

483
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,120
Can I help you?

484
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,870
Quan Ruru, right?

485
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,140
I'm here to see He Yueluan.

486
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,460
Who are you?

487
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,250
Don't you remember me? We met at the KTV.

488
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,522
<i>Ruru, is it the express delivery?</i>

489
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:46,610
Don't unbox it. Let me do it.

490
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,880
Ning Meng.

491
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,340
How did you know I was here?

492
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,420
A five-bedroom house with a garden.

493
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,648
You paid 15 million yuan in full.

494
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,260
You lied to You Qi that you were marrying her.

495
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,004
She's still waiting for you to marry her like a fool.

496
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:13,892
Yet, you're cheating on her.

497
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,240
It's none of your business.

498
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,020
You know he has a girlfriend, right?

499
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,990
Not only does he have a girlfriend, but he also has a lover at his office.

500
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,770
You look like a decent person.

501
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,838
Why do you have the hobby of collecting trash like him?

502
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:36,170
- Luan.
- Ning Meng, stop it.

503
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,137
You're just here to seek justice for You Qi, right?

504
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,858
Fine. We can talk about it outside.

505
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:43,410
No need.

506
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,170
We'll talk here.

507
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,100
Why are you here?

508
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,890
I checked his food delivery transactions.

509
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,030
Who is she?

510
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,890
Qiqi.

511
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
Are you okay?

512
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,550
You Qi.

513
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,232
Our breakup is our business.

514
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,080
It has nothing to do with her.

515
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,040
Don't make a scene here.

516
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,720
He Yueluan, do you know what you're saying?

517
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,790
He Yueluan, do you still remember

518
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,430
what you said when you begged me to be your girlfriend?

519
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,248
You swore you'd be devoted to me your whole life.

520
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,380
You even said if you had a change of heart, you'd suffer from retribution.

521
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,310
Do you still remember that?

522
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,750
Make sure you seek retribution.

523
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,836
I'm free today.

524
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,730
I'll keep you company.

525
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,238
You don't have to. I'm fine.

526
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,144
The house is messy.

527
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:46,950
I need to clean it up.

528
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>[Huadong Hospital]</i>

529
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,130
Mingming, come and have something to eat.

530
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,120
I bought your favorite har gow.
<i>(A traditional Cantonese dumpling served in dim sum)</i>

531
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,200
Let me do it, Madam Liu.

532
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,360
You haven't gone to work for two days.

533
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,630
I'm sure many things are waiting for you to complete.

534
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,090
You should go back to the office after eating.

535
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,770
Madam Liu, it must be hard on you for the past two days.

536
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,530
We're a family, so don't say that.

537
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,520
It's been tough on you for these two days, too.

538
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
I won't be able to help you with your work.

539
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,230
I'll be here to take care of him. So, don't worry.

540
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,270
Hello, is Mr. Lu here?

541
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,560
Who are you looking for?

542
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,924
Madam Liu, they're here to see me.

543
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:04,362
Let's talk outside.

544
00:42:04,362 --> 00:42:05,430
Madam Liu, why don't you eat first?

545
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,730
Okay.

546
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,660
Mr. Lu, we're lawyers entrusted by the bank.

547
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,190
According to Clause 10 of the loan agreement between you and the bank,

548
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,940
overdue payment is a form of a breach of contract.

549
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,360
I'm already working on it.

550
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,190
It's going to take a while for the turnaround.

551
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,702
Can you give me some more time?

552
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,850
Mr. Lu, we also understand the situation in your home.

553
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,050
But we can only give you a limited time for the turnaround.

554
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,760
So we hope you cooperate and pay some part of the loan.

555
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,060
I get it.

556
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,490
Thank you for stretching the rules for me.

557
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,130
Mr. Lu, you're a public figure among the investment community.

558
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,940
We don't wish to sue you.

559
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,900
If the court decides to discredit you,

560
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,330
it'll have an adverse impact on your life and work.

561
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,130
I understand.

562
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,126
I will pay what I owe. Not a penny less.

563
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:11,030
Thank you, Mr. Lu.
