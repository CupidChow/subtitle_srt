Mr. Lu.
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

4
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:42,470
Lu Mingming, I brought the crabs here for you. Is this how you welcome me?

5
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,088
Scram!

6
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,618
What's going on?

7
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,518
Scram to the Project Department.

8
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,000
The Project Department?

9
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,082
Yes.

10
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,070
I've thought about it for you.

11
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,064
You were quite impulsive just now,

12
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,820
quitting your job on impulse.

13
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,492
This isn't good conduct.

14
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,620
I'm giving you some leeway.

15
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,360
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,598
I'll give you one month in the Project Department.

17
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,054
After one month, if you can't get the knack of it,

18
00:02:39,054 --> 00:02:43,752
come back and be my secretary.

19
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:47,688
By then, if you still mention resigning and keep causing a scene,

20
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,712
I'll definitely kick you out.

21
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,548
Six months.

22
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,160
You don't have the right to bargain with me.

23
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,030
How is it possible to get the knack for it in a month?

24
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,718
Four months at the very least...

25
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,976
One and a half months at most.

26
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,118
Let me be the go-between.

27
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:10,030
How about three months?

28
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,298
Mind your own business.

29
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:13,980
I think three months is workable.

30
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,512
I can accept Mr. Zeng's suggestion.

31
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,264
Two months then.

32
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,390
Don't push your luck.

33
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,074
Take it or leave it.

34
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,618
Deal.

35

36
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,158
Amazing.

37
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,100
Don't be mad. She's only a secretary.

38
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,570
You can just find another one.

39
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,766
What are you fanning for?

40
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,000
It's easier said than done.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,302
Before Ning Meng, I've replaced my secretary several times.

42
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:54,600
This Ning Meng is reliable and smart.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,210
Who knows? She might achieve something remarkable in the Project Department.

44
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,650
You'll have another powerful general in your company then.

45
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,030
And this powerful general is personally trained by you.

46
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,954
You know nothing.

47

Here, a good secretary

48
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,340
is more valuable than an investment director.

49
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,080
Stop advising if you know nothing.

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,000
Also, why did you put in good words for her just now?

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,170
I didn't get even with you about the bag's matter.

52
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,070
Give it to me if she doesn't want it.

53
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,480
- Do you deserve it?
- Yes.

No, that's not it.

Mr. Qiu, actually I studied finance.

I'm just kidding. Don't be nervous.

63

Hello, Ms. Feng. Come to my office.

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,878
Mr. Qiu.

66
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,440
You two know each other. I'll skip the introduction then.

67
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,100
Well, Ms. Feng, assign a workstation for Ms. Ning later and introduce

68
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,228
our colleagues to her.

69
00:05:26,228 --> 00:05:31,730
Ms. Ning, if you have any questions from now on, you may look for Ms. Feng.

70
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,864
Thank you.

71
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:37,108
Mr. Qiu, you may call me Ning Meng.

72

I've gotten used to it.

73
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,760
It's fine.

74
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,070
I'll go and pack my things then.

75
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,934
Okay.

76
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,078
Mr. Qiu, what's going on?

77
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,322
She was suddenly transferred to our department?

78
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,916
What does Mr. Lu mean?

79
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,290
Stop overthinking.

80
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,622
Well, just be vigilant in your speech from now on.

81
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,334
Keep her under observation.

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,926
Understood.

83
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,280
I don't think Ning Meng can survive more than two months in the Investment Department.

84
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,270
She might come back in just a few days.

85
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,014
Just treat it as a minor setback.

86
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,698
Come in!

87
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,138

- If you're busy, I'll...
- Speak.

00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,300
It's about... Ning Meng's work arrangement.

91
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you have any instructions?

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,940
No.

93
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,246
Mr. Lu, Ning Meng's position in the company is rather special.

94
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,760
She's a senior.

95
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,920
But in the Investment Department, she's a novice.

96
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,790
Should I apply the expectations of a novice to her or...

97
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,350
Just assign her tasks based on her capabilities.

98
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,270
If she's incapable, then send her to where she belongs.

99
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,730
Understood?

100
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,030
No special treatment required?

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,790
Have we ever practiced special treatment in our company?

102
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,130
No.

103
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,810
Understood. I'll get busy then.

104
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:26,070
Qiu touched a soft spot and asked for trouble.

105
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,600
No one is steaming the crabs?

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,608
I'll make you one first and hopefully, it will calm you down.

109
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,500
He asked me to scram in front of everyone.

110
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,750
I was dumbstruck.

111
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,250
I almost struck him a blow.

112

<i>What happened next?</i>

113
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,714
Before I managed to burst out, he asked me

114
00:07:57,714 --> 00:07:59,618
to scram to the Project Department.

115
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:01,830
<i>Gosh. Wasn't this an interesting turn of events?</i>

116
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,690
I guess what he said before that was intended to reprimand me

117
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,830
but was afraid that I'd resign.

118
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:09,190
So, he made up for it.

119
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:14,004
That's smart of him. He did it naturally.

120

<i>Look at you. You're grinning like a Cheshire cat.</i>

Although your boss is usually a little abnormal,

124
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,194
he was terrific in dealing with this matter. Right?

In the past few years,

128
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:38,010
if I didn't rely on this belief, I'd have succumbed to him.

129
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,200
Yes. You've been a secretary for years.

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,320
But you're now transferred to the Project Department. Will you be able to adapt to it?

131
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,084
Honestly, I'm a little nervous.

132
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:48,508
But I didn't stay idle in the past few years.

133
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:50,606

No problem.

But let me give you a friendly reminder.

150
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:27,964
You were a secretary.

151
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:29,840
You only answered to your boss.

152
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,308
It was a simple interpersonal relationship.

153
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,814
But in the Project Department, you're only an ordinary employee.

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm no longer Mr. Lu's secretary.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,708
I'll forward the person's WeChat contact to you later.

168
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,104
Smells so good.

169
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:07,258
But it's too complicated.

170
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,640
There are more difficult ones.

171
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,432
I'll teach you next time.

172
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:14,400
This is the printed copy of the background check on Kirin's Furniture.

173
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Mr. Lu might need it nowadays. Keep it safe.

174
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,800
And these are his personal items. Keep them safe, too.

175
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,080
By the way, I bought something online.

176
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,464
I'll give you the order number later.

177
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:28,776
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

178
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:31,712
Meng, congratulations.

179
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:34,326
Do you look like you're congratulating me?

180
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,750
- Here.
- What is this?

181
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,288
Instruction manual.

182
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:44,898
"Mr. Lu's User Manual."

183
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,038
What's wrong with Mr. Lu?

184
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:53,940
Just get used to it.

185
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,416
Mr. Lu.

186
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,048
Hi, Mr. Lu.

187
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:02,130
Be serious in the handover. Why are you smiling?

188
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,872
I didn't... smile.

189
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,282
Do you think a change of attire makes you an investor?

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,250
I'll work hard in the Project Department.

191
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,930
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

192
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,800
You! Make me some coffee.

193
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,320
All the best.

194
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,272
I'll treat you to hotpot later.

195
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,748
<i>[Ning Meng, Business Department II]</i>

196
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,140
Good morning.

197
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:37,478
<i>[To Feng Xiao. Ms. Feng, may I know my work arrangement for today?]</i>

198
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,438
Mr. Liu.

199
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:52,942
Ning Meng.

200
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,966
How are you getting on with your new position?

201
00:13:57,966 --> 00:14:00,662
I just got started on it.

202
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,080
Mr. Liu, I'd like to ask if you know where the others are.

203
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,280
Why are none of them here at this hour?

204
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,650
This morning, Qiu Junlin told me

205
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,110
that they had a meeting at the tender company.

206
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,978
No one informed you?

207
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,838
No.

208
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:22,066
How sloppy Qiu is.

209
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,980
Maybe they left you out since you're new there.

210
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,600
Don't take it to heart.

211
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,550
I'm fine. It's my first day at work.

212
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not familiar with the projects.

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,036
I can do some homework first.

214
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,810
Ning Meng, I'd like to give you some advice.

215
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,200
Try it out at the Project Department for some time.

216
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,124
If you find it unsuitable,

217
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,010
then return to your secretary job quickly.

218
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,142
Mr. Lu will let it pass.

219
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:50,030
We're looking forward to your return.

220
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,280
Mr. Liu, thank you for your kindness.

221
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,412
But I'm not someone who likes to look back.

222
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,208
You're still young.

223
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,880
Specialize in one field in your life.

224
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,064
If you do it well, it's an achievement.

225
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,670
Its advantage lies in how to seize the sinking market.

226
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,430
Yes, sinking markets are both icebergs and gold mines.

227
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,842
Okay. That's all for now.

228
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,226
It's not a good start for her.

229
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,672
Yang Xiaoyang! What did you just brew?

230
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,690
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>
Okay, Mr. Qiu.

231
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,350
I'll send you a copy of the meeting minutes shortly.

232
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,798
Okay.

233
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,972
Ning Meng.

234
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,110
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,000
I forgot to inform you that you need to attend the morning meeting.

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,348
It's my fault.

237
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:04,510
- I must treat you to a meal later as an apology.
- It's fine.

238
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,296
From now on, I'll follow Mr. Qiu's and your work arrangement.

239
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,260
So, you'll follow our arrangement?

240
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,340
Mr. Lu won't question it then?

241
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,808
I think so.

242
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,000
So, you're officially joining our Department II?

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,740
Or you'll move in between Department I and Department II?

244
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,670
Periodically come down to our grassroots level to experience life?

245
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,570
Don't. Don't call it the grassroots level.

246
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,210
I'm only an ordinary employee. I'm here to work.

247
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,446
Anyway, Mr. Qiu can just assign any tasks to me.

248
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,758
Okay.

249
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,316
I heard that you made a bet with Mr. Lu.

250
00:16:44,316 --> 00:16:47,470
If you can't achieve any results in two months,

251
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,898
you'll return to become his secretary.

252
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,052
You're really amazing.

253
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:59,398
Mr. Lu has never treated us with such a relaxed attitude.

254
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,400
If I didn't achieve any results in two months,

255
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,904
I have to leave the company.

256
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,158
I see.

257
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,000
All right. I won't joke with you.

258
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,372
Why don't you adapt yourself to our work environment first?

259
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,060
- Okay.
- Carry on.

260
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,620
- Feel free to look for me if you need anything.
- Okay.

261
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,866
You're amazing.

262
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,280
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Ning Meng. Your parcel is in the reception area.</i>

263
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,026
Okay.

264
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:40,670
<i>[JOINT CAPITAL]</i>

265
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,558
Come in.

266
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,512
Mr. Lu, the fishing equipment I bought for your dad has arrived.

267
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:13,490
- I'll show you how to use it.
- Do I look like I'm free now?

268
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,820
Come home with me and teach him how to use it.

269
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,880
Mr. Lu, I just started in the Project Department.

270
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,200
That's right. You just started at the Project Department.

271
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,092
You don't have to work overtime.

272
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,820
Coming!

273
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,844
Mingming, come in.

274
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:55,844
- Madam Liu.
- Madam Liu.

275
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,070
Welcome, Ning.

276
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,490
Come on. Change into the slippers I've prepared.

277
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,966
Give it to me. It's inconvenient for you to hold it.

278
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,640
- You bought this for your dad?
- Yes.

279
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,740
He'll definitely love it.

280
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,242
Did you know that your dad is thrilled about your visit?

281
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,978
What are you chattering about?

282
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:17,058
Just say it out loud.

283
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,602
Come in and speak.

284
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,930
- Come in!
- Come on.

285
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,060
Come in quickly. Take a seat.

286
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,764
Hi, Mr. Lu.

287
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,694
Take a seat. I'll prepare dinner.

288
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,812
You two came in time.

289
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,522
I'll get you some water.

290
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,838
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

291
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,988
Try the water.

292
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,630
- Why aren't you drinking?
- I'm not thirsty.

293
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,200
- Even so, just try it.
- What for? It's just water.

294
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,680
I drank it before.

295
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,776
Just do as I said.

296
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,242
How does it taste?

297
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:17,662
It's quite good.

298
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:20,576
Is this purified water or mineral water?

299
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,206
This can be called purified water.

300
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,350
I just started testing out the machine.

301
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,800
Besides having a powerful water purification function,

302
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,524
it also takes the mouthfeel into account.

303
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,656
But the filtering process is a little slow.

304
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,498
Nowadays, which water purifiers spout water instantly?

305
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,530
Who said this is purified tap water?

306
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,850
This is purified water from the stinky river ditches.

307
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,160
I just brought home a pail.

308
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,384
Over there. See it?

309
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,990
No, Dad.

310
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,920
You're asking us to drink filthy water?

311
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,310
No. This is purified filthy water.

312
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,190
Isn't it purified water, too?

313
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,700
Even if you want us to be your guinea pigs,

314
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,920
shouldn't you at least let us know beforehand?

315
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,520
What if we get diarrhea after drinking the water

316
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,844
and have to be admitted to the hospital?

317
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:17,680
If I told you this was filthy water, would you still drink it?

318
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,096
It's not that.

319
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,166
Don't give me that look.

320
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:28,810
Do you know how grave the pollution issue caused by industrial wastewater and agriculture is?

321
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,550
Natural water purification equipment is an inevitable trend in the future.

322
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,394
If you want to invest, then invest more in such projects.

323
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:40,332
Don't keep investing in those entertainment projects.

324
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:45,054
I think your investment criteria are rather idealistic. That's so out-of-date.

325
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,080
No. You know nothing.

326
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,400
Environment protection has to keep up with a developing society.

327
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,628
Otherwise, issues will occur one day.

328
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,430
It's called social responsibility. Do you have it?

329
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,330
Why do you think that I have no sense of responsibility?

330
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,520
I think the consumer products I invested in have changed the way people live.

331
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,960
It's very meaningful. You may keep taking the moral high ground.

332
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,430
Why are you suppressing me?

333
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,310
Did I take the moral high ground?

334
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,920
You're bickering, aren't you?

335
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,190
- Who's bickering here?
- You.

336
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,950
Mr. Lu, don't be mad.

337
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,634
He bought you a gift.

338
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,384
See if you like it.

339
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:22,086
This is a high-tech fishing rod.

340
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:24,060
It's an automatic fish finder.

341
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,880
It will drag the fish to the hook for release.

342
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,760
And there's a camera inside that rotates automatically.

343
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,710
This way, you can see both the surface

344
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,958
and the bottom of the water clearly.

345
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,190
This is rather good.

346
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,830
From now on, the little fish can no longer play hide-and-seek with me.

347
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,714
That's right.

348
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:47,048
Mr. Lu specifically selected it for you.

349
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,026
It's inconvenient to carry something this big.

350
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:58,738
Carry it to go fishing?

351
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,980
But you can catch fish.

352
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,564
Here you go.

353
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,656
Look. Eight dishes. What an auspicious number.

354
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:11,880
I've also made soup. One moment, please.

355
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,116
Dig in.

356
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,506
Ning, you've worked with Lu Jiming for several years, right?

357
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,146
It has been three years.

358
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,520
It's not easy being his secretary.

359
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,792
He has the temper of a wolfhound.

360
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,214
It's not easy being your secretary, either.

361
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:34,800
Look at Madam Liu.

362
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,070
She married you before her retirement.

363
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,640
- What is it called? Out of the frying pan into...
- Mr. Lu,

364
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,350
I've been transferred to the Project Department.

365
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,694
I'm no longer his secretary.

366
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:47,638
You're no longer his secretary?

367
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:51,096
You can't stand him, right?

368
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,680
Ning has such a good character. Yet, she can't stand it by your side.

369
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,170
It reflects your work performance. You should reflect on it.

370
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,096
You know nothing.

371
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,080
- How can you speak for her?
- Am I wrong?

372
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,630
It's not that, I transferred because I'm into investment.

373
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,760
Look at Ning. She still saves you some face.

374
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,644
Ning, work hard and realize your ambition.

375
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:19,944
Thank you, Mr. Lu. I'll work hard.

376
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:22,000
She has no talent for investment.

377
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,710
Well, who's born with a talent for investment?

378
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,038
Am I?

379
00:24:26,038 --> 00:24:27,976
Didn't I do a great job, too?

380
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:29,530
Your employee aspires for progress.

381
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,910
You didn't encourage her but suppressed her instead.

382
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,450
What kind of management style is this?

383
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,930
Is that how you run the company?

384
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,738
You want to intervene in my company's internal affairs?

385
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:40,290
You're lecturing me for the sake of teaching me a lesson.

386
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,502
Then, you're here to lecture me, too?

387
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,568
Insolence!

388
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,950
Don't ever think that you can be arrogant because

389
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,726
you've invested in a few profitable projects.

390
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,980
Well, Lu.

391
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,264
Here's the soup.

392
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,086
It's your favorite.

393
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,570
Madam Liu, I just recalled that I have a meeting.

394
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,446
Enjoy your dinner.

395
00:25:05,446 --> 00:25:08,350
Look, Mingming. You haven't eaten yet.

396
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,800
Don't bother about him. It's his call.

397
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,406
Ning Meng, are you going to stay here for dinner?

398
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,606
- Mr...
- Stay here.

399
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,490
Well, Mr. Lu and Madam Liu. I'm sorry. We have a meeting.

400
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,760
We'll get going. Enjoy your dinner.

401
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,328
I'm leaving, Madam Liu.

402
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,848
Mr. Lu, why not get Song to take you for dinner?

403
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,980
Mr. Lu, what would you want to have?

404
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,028
Eat? I'm full of anger.

405
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me tell you.

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,100
Don't ever think that you can go your way just because my dad

407
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,612
put in some good words for you.

408
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:54,728
He did it to set himself against me.

409
00:25:54,728 --> 00:25:59,896
No matter who came today, he would support their investment intention.

410
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:02,714
Get it, Ning?

411
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:05,520
Mr. Lu, I'm with the Project Department now.

412
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,040
Why are you telling me this?

413
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,264
Do you really want me to come back?

414
00:26:09,264 --> 00:26:12,094
Am I so outstanding?

415
00:26:12,094 --> 00:26:15,258
You're overthinking it.

416
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:18,000
I've trained you for three years

417
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,180
from a noob to a qualified white-collar worker.

418
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,170
You want to fly away after learning the ropes.

419
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,010
Do you think I can swallow this insult?

420
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,860
Well, you'd better not swallow it. Otherwise, you'll...

421
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,510
- Otherwise, you'll...
- Ning Meng,

422
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,510
it looks like I still don't know you well.

423
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,070
You've got guts talking back to me like this.

424
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:39,018
Look! I've shown my true colors.

425
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:41,380
So, you'd better not let me come back to annoy you.

426
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,076
How garrulous.

427
00:26:43,076 --> 00:26:44,508
Let me tell you.

428
00:26:44,508 --> 00:26:47,360
Come back to me if you can't hold it out.

429
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,144
Don't make a fool of yourself.

430
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,340
Why are you looking at me?

431
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,132
Why aren't you moving? Go.

432
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:02,430
Mr. Lu, I have no idea where to go, I dare not move.

433
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,180
- Where can we go?
- Well, Song,

434
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,500
drop me off at the subway station.

435
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,032
Okay.

436
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,010
Okay.

437
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,166
Ning Meng.

438
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,100
- Ms. Feng.
- Mr. Qiu is back.

439
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,230
He asked you to sort out all the funding projects

440
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,760
our department has dealt with in the previous and the current phases.

441
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,630
There must be 700 to 800 projects in total for these two phases.

442
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,440
It's more than that. About 900 projects.

443
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,070
That's why we need to sort them out.

444
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,130
Classify the financial and financing situations of the projects into a table.

445
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll email the template to you shortly.

446
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,270
It's not urgent. Just pass it to me tomorrow.

447
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,540
Tomorrow?

448
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,302
Do you need any help?

449
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,474
No. It's fine.

450
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,080
<i>I'm leaving. Bye.</i>

451
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,030
<i>- Xiaoyang, I'm leaving.
- Bye.</i>

452
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,810
Ning Meng, you're still here?

453
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,700
- You're so hardworking.
- Aren't you still here, too?

454
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,470
You did it voluntarily but I'm forced into it.

455
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,578
I wonder how long I have to suffer this.

456
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,948
It must be hard on you.

457
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:36,800
I'll carry on with my work then.

458
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,650
- Keep going.
- You too.

459
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,220
Please confirm with Tang Zhengwang again when the samples will be ready.

460
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,560
Inform Ms. Shi of Eaglestone Capital in advance.

461
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,470
Also, sort out the information from Qilin.

462
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,630
The budget for the costs of purchase, samples, and orders should be more detailed.

463
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,570
Also, I have some plans for 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

464
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,990
Reschedule my meeting with the bank to 10:00 a.m. the day after tomorrow.

465
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,590
Mr. Lu, what's the second point?

466
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,492
If you can't manage it using a notebook, get a notebook.

467
00:29:16,492 --> 00:29:18,940
Note... What do you mean?

468
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,344
A notebook computer.

469
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,244
Forget it. I'll send it to you via WeChat.

470
00:29:26,244 --> 00:29:28,898
Thank you, Mr. Lu. Goodbye.

471
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,820
Mr. Lu.

472
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,756
I caught a glimpse and found some mistakes.

473
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:16,160
Why has your intelligence deteriorated after changing to a new department?

474
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,586
I'm about to amend it.

475
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:20,740
Qiu Junlin assigned you this kind of task?

476
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,066
Why do I feel...

477
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:26,908
that you are still a secretary in this new place?

478
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,960
That's different. The goals are different.

479
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,350
Even if the road ahead is the same,

480
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:35,406
it will end up differently.

481
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:38,524
Okay. Enjoy your walk.

482
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,354
But don't forget...

483
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:42,554
that you have 57 days left.

484
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,202
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

485
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,680
Why isn't Mingming here yet? Call him.

486
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,878
He's like a ticking bomb lately.

487
00:31:23,878 --> 00:31:26,178
I don't want to step on the bombshell. Call him yourself.

488
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,680
I call him? That's so embarrassing.

489
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, shouldn't I be more reserved in front of Mingming?

490
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,500
My young lady Ms. Xu, when have you been reserved in front of Mingming?

491
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,762
What did you say is happening to Mingming?

492
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:46,498
It's all that secretary's fault.

493
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:49,280
Don't bring it up when he's here later. He'll be furious as soon as you mention it.

494
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,640
Ning Meng? What did she do?

495
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,632
What else? Investment.

496
00:31:54,632 --> 00:31:58,620
Investment? Is it for any Tom, Dick, and Harry?

497
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,224
Life is so ironic.

498
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,070
There's a term called the law of conflict of passion. Have you heard of it?

499
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,800
No. You made it up, right?

500
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,704
It's because you're not a cultured person.

501
00:32:11,704 --> 00:32:16,364
As the saying goes, what you like isn't something you're adept at.

502
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:19,790
What you're adept at isn't something that you like.

503
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,470
Let's take Ning Meng as an example.

504
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,214
She doesn't like being Lu Jiming's secretary.

505
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:28,040
But she was born for Mingming.

506
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,804
You see...

507
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,710
Are you drunk?

508
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,800
What's with all that nonsense?

509
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,230
Xu Tiantian, let me tell you this.

510
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,460
You must not hit me again. I'm already an adult.

511
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
Try hitting Lu Jiming.

512
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,000
Do you dare? Why don't you dare?

513
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,250
You can't understand what's on his mind.

514
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:47,970
No one can do that except the little secretary.

515
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,610
When to make concessions and when to fight back.

516
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,850
She's very clear about it.

517
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,074
Now that she's gone, Mingming must be in pain.

518
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,048
Why are you smiling?

519
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,548
Why did you come so close to me?

520
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:10,038
I want to make you mad.

521
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,872
Is Mingming looking for a new secretary?

522
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,024
No.

523
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:20,988
He is leaving the position vacant for her return.

524
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,080
Mingming has a meeting. He's not coming. Bottoms-up.

525
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,670
I just recalled that I have something on. I'll get going.

526
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,964
Can't you drink with me without Mingming?

527
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:38,610
Am I a spare tire?

528
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,620
<i>[Traffic is king. Collaborating with the industry to build a new consumption model]</i>

529
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,320
<i>[Building a campus-centered ecology]</i>

530
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,356
<i>[Building a financial factory that serves young people]</i>

531
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,070
<i>Hello, Mr. Lu.</i>

532
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,602
What is this?

533
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:57,230
A tangram?

534
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,160
Have you seen how Ning Meng does it?

535
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,640
<i>Mr. Lu, I'm sorry.</i>

536
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,972
<i>I'll redo it immediately.</i>

537
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,606
Forget it.

538
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,162
Good day, Mr. Lu.

539
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,334
What's good?

540
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,142
<i>Hi, Mr. Lu.</i>

541
00:35:34,142 --> 00:35:34,950
<i>Good morning, Mr. Lu.</i>

542
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,180
<i>- Mr. Lu.
- Good morning, Mr. Lu.</i>

543
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,870
Yang Xiaoyang!

544
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,730
<i>I'm coming!</i>

545
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,934
Surprise!

546
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,530
- Why are you here?
- I heard that your secretary is gone.

547
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,710
From now on, I'll be your personal secretary.

548
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,138
I don't think anyone is more suitable than me.

549
00:36:19,138 --> 00:36:21,796
Zeng Yuhang is rather loose-lipped.

550
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,798
Are these your doings?

551
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,780
But, Ms. Xu, I don't feel good bothering you with the job of a secretary.

552
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,900
As your friend, childhood friend, and strategic partner,

553
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,960
I feel, that I must send help in your hour of need.

554
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,992
Help is here.

555
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,580
- Speak.
<i>- Ms. Xu, your order from Luckin Coffee has arrived at the reception area.</i>

556
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,710
Bring them in.

557
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,520
Send two cups to Mr. Lu's office and the rest to the employees.

558
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
<i>Thank you.</i>

559
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,840
<i>Yang Xiaoyang.</i>

560
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,470
Ms. Xu Sitian has ordered some coffee for all employees of Joint Capital.

561
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,490
- Creamy latte. Raw coconut latte.
- Here.

562
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,580
- Velvet latte.
- Thank you, Ms. Xu.

563
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,534
Take your pick.

564
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,870
From now on, I'm not only your investor

565
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,500
- but also Mr. Lu's secretary.
- Secretary?

566
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,792
Just call me Ms. Xu the secretary...

567
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,260
Ms. Xu the director secretary, or Ms. Xu the secretary director.

568
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,570
Tiantian, what are you playing at?

569
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,300
From now on, I'll take care of the coffee and tea for the entire company.

570
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,262
Come on.

571
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,004
Sit.

572
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:47,424
Tiantian,

573
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,670
do you think it's appropriate for you to be my secretary?

574
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,180
What if your dad caught wind of this?

575
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,120
It's appropriate. My dad knows it.

576
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,208
He agreed to it.

577
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:03,430
Even so, shouldn't you ask me if I agreed to it?

578
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,486
Why would you disagree? That's impossible.

579
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,704
Mingming, you don't feel willing to, right?

580
00:38:13,704 --> 00:38:15,870
I don't care. I'm already here.

581
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,784
I won't leave.

582
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,288
What are you doing? Call Zeng Yuhang?

583
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,358
Let me tell you. He won't answer your call.

584
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,670
<i>Hello, the number you dialed is powered off.</i>

585
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,830
<i>The subscriber you've dialed is powered off.</i>

586
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:37,698
<i>Hello, the number you dialed...</i>

587
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,290
Tiantian, what about this?

588
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,660
Try it out for one day.

589
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,990
One day?

590
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,000
I just recalled that I have something urgent.

591
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,004
Let's talk about your probation period next time.

592
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:54,908
Okay, Mr. Lu. I'll wait for you here.

593
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,254
Come in.

594
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,470
Mr. Qiu, these are the data and report you asked me to sort out.

595
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,790
That fast?

596
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,208
I pulled an all-nighter to complete it last night.

597
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,324
Mr. Qiu, are there other tasks for me?

598
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,840
Ning Meng.

599
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,630
Well, maybe you've been working as a secretary

600
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,190
and aren't familiar with the workflow in our department.

601
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,080
In the future, you'll report to Ms. Feng.

602
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,084
You don't have to bypass her and report to me.

603
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,950
I'll get busy then.

604
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,238
Okay.

605
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,980
Mr. Qiu,

606
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,710
I'm getting more confused about the company's recent decisions.

607
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,888
First, Ning Meng, the secretary was transferred to our department.

608
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:25,506
Now, Ms. Xu replaced Ning Meng as Mr. Lu's secretary.

609
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:29,430
Isn't the young lady Ms. Xu Sitian always acting on impulse?

610
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,318
She'll quit after a few days.

611
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,490
The main point is Ning Meng isn't that simple.

612
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,924
Look at these.

613
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,800
She has sorted them out.

614
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,360
She completed it within such a short time.

615
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,064
She didn't complain but has gotten it done well instead.

616
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:51,056
I can't even find a mistake.

617
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,852
Someone who managed to work under Mr. Lu for three years isn't an ordinary person.

618
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:03,162
That day, Mr. Lu told me that if Ning Meng can't handle projects,

619
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:05,700
just send her to where she belongs.

620
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,826
We can't keep treating her coldly.

621
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:15,106
What kind of suitable project should we assign her?

622
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,806
Didn't Xu Sitian take on the RV park project previously?

623
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:23,660
- Is anyone investigating it?
- No.

624
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,230
A project without someone to deal with.

625
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,878
And someone has no project to work on.

626
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:30,738
Isn't it just right?

627
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,996
- Ning Meng.
- Ms. Feng.

628
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:51,930
You did a good job. Mr. Qiu is very satisfied.

629
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,568
After all, someone from Mr. Lu's office is quite efficient.

630
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:57,670
Thank you.

631
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:59,974
Haven't you been looking forward to working on a project?

632
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:02,964
Here's your chance.

633
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:04,700
- What kind of project is this?
- Look.

634
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,626
This is a particularly important project, the RV park.

635
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,230
But this is a rather urgent project.

636
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,562
You have to turn in the report before next Tuesday's meeting.

637
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:17,190
I understand the timeline is a little tight.

638
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,970
And this is a whole new field for you.

639
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,900
Are you able to get it done?

640
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,876
Yes.

641
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,410
All the best.

647
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,898
♫ <i>And be labeled</i> ♫

648
00:43:00,898 --> 00:43:03,250
♫ <i>To be the best of me</i> ♫

649
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,078
♫ <i>To meet the best of you again</i> ♫

650
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:16,710
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

651
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,740
♫ <i>No matter how reluctant you feel</i> ♫

652
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,580
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫

653
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:31,970
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

654
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,940
♫ <i>Watching the fallen leaves, listening to the wind</i> ♫

655
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:39,116
♫ <i>Saying that all colors have luster</i> ♫

656
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,520
♫ <i>Don't want to be bullied, to be brushed off</i> ♫

657
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,950
♫ <i>And to be treated like a fool</i> ♫

658
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,150
♫ <i>Breaking through the laws of the world</i> ♫

659
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:10,000
♫ <i>And reconnect with the sacred heart</i> ♫

660
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,610
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

661
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,580
♫ <i>Every little thing we gain in life</i> ♫

662
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,008
♫ <i>Comes with huge obstacles</i> ♫

663
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:33,000
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

664
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,960
♫ <i>There's no so-called happy ending</i> ♫

665
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,232
♫ <i>Just make your decision with bravery</i> ♫
