Ms. Feng, this is last month's performance graph.

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,220
- Please take a look.
- Okay. Good job.

Okay.

8
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,570
Ms. Feng, are you free right now?

9
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,440
I wish to ask for your advice on something.

10
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,200
It's fine. Ask away.

When I was organizing the projects, I saw Locke's Thermos Cup Project.

I wish to know about the details from you.

You can try to digest it yourself.

16
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,930
We have a few hundred funds to manage each session.

17
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,580
This project was more than a year ago.

18
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,230
I really can't remember the details.

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,530

Yeah.

You've spent so much even though it isn't the Double 11 Shopping Festival yet.

Why did you buy so many things?

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Are all of them thermos cups?

32
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm studying a project right now.

33
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm giving every commercially available thermos cup a try.

34
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,760
I want to compare them.

35

But you've bought so many of them.

36
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,430
Will the company reimburse you for it?

37
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,390
That's not important.

38
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,160
By the way, you can send these

Let's turn the health care industry into a cool business.

65
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,790
Actually, Joint Capital did consider your company a year ago.

66
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,190
However, due to the thermos cups' steam leakage, they didn't make a bid.

67
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,010
Steam leakage?

68
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,810
That's so long ago. We've already found the solution to it.

69
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,800
Have you used our latest product?

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,870
Of course.

71
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,670
What do you think?

72
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,840
I think its design is excellent.

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,140
However, when it comes to user experience,

74
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,010
I do have something that I want to complain about.

75
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,790
That's fine. I love complaints.

76
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,430
Come on, complain to me.

77
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,490
For example, the rechargeable heating base

78
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,040
is a great concept.

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,830
When we stay in hotels during business trips,

80
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,160
it serves as a great hygienic option.

81
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,910
But usually, if we head to work and go to the gym,

82
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,530
we don't necessarily need to drink boiling water.

83
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,050
We just need hot water.

84
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,350
That's why, if you don't make the heating base detachable,

85
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,110
it'll be slightly cumbersome.

86
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,410
It will increase its weight and occupy more space in our bags.

87
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,320
Under such circumstances, I would rather use ordinary thermos cups from other brands.

88
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,340
So, you are saying...

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,700
that we should split up the functions and modularize it?

90
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,180
For example,

91
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,250
we should detach the heating base and drainage layer

92
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,720
from the thermos cup itself.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,050
That way, we can use the thermos cup by itself, am I right?

94
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,470
That's right.

95
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,030
Sure.

96
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,310
I will summon my team here for a meeting.

97
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,430
If you're interested, you're welcome to direct our meeting.

98
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,630
I'm not good enough to do so.

99
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,310
However, I'm very willing to have a chat with you guys.

Where did you get this project?

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,860
I found it among the projects that were filtered out two years ago.

103
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,030
It was filtered out?

104
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,180
You'll know when you take a look.

105

Their product has been upgraded.

106
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,740
And all of the previous issues were resolved.

107
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,360
I think it has great potential. It's worth reconsidering.

108
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,860
That's why I've made a new business proposal.

109
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,540
So you're recycling old materials?

110
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,710
I have some other ideas, too.

111
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,830
They're related to the product itself and its marketing strategy.

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,230
I've included them in the proposal.

113
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,820
So just leave it here.

114
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,060
I'll read it when I'm free.

115
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,440
- I'll head back now.
- Okay.

116
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,340
Mr. Lu, here's your coffee.

117
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,300
Have you arranged the meeting between Ms. Shi and me at Kirin's Furniture?

118
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,870
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,270
Tell me the rest of my schedule.

120
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,470
And when is the financial magazine interview again?

121
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,570
The interview?

122
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,740
Mr. Lu, let me take out my notebook.

123
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,540
Come back.

124
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,710
You've been working here for so long.

125
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,640
But you can't even make a decent cup of coffee?

126
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,310
Did you grow a head just so you could look taller?

127
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,030
Mr. Lu, I've been making the same coffee for a month.

128
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,650
But you didn't complain about it before.

129
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,660
I did so in order to give you time

130
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,820
to recognize your own mistake so that you could change your ways.

131
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,300
Yes, sir. What do you know?

132
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,770
I understand now.

133
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,790
Excuse me, Mr. Lu.

134
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,520
What?

135
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,910
Ms. Xu just resigned, right?

136
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,950
Do you need me to get you a secretary from Mr. Liu's side?

137
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,620
Are you teaching me what to do now?

138
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,250
How about this?

139
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,840
- You can take over my position. What do you think?
- No, Mr. Xu...

140
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,450
I mean Mr. Lu!

141
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm really sorry!

142
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,540
I'll head to work first. Please continue.

143
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,960
Liu Yitian was the one who told me to ask him.

144
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
In the end, I was scolded instead.

145
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,330
Meng, I'm serious. I can't work in Joint Capital anymore.

146
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,750
Mr. Lu will surely sack me one of these days.

147
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,760
Do you think I can find a new job in time?

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,160
Mr. Lu's temper is fleeting.

149
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't worry. He won't do anything to you.

150
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,300
Ning Meng, are you sure you don't want to turn back?

151
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,880
Mr. Lu has been keeping that post open for you.

152
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm serious. You're the only person in the company who can deal with him.

153
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,230
Sometimes,

154
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,980
I even feel like...

155
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,520
he has something for you.

156
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,090
What are you thinking?

157
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,960
He has something for me?

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,440
Do you see how he treats me usually?

159
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,830
You do have a point.

160
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,100
If he did have something for you,

161
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,480
he would never do this to you.

162
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,100
Meng, listen.

163
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,690
When I first joined this company

164
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,530
and saw that we had a hunk as our boss,

165
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,100
I thought we could...

166
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,040
What about now?

167
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,210
I was sloppy. I was too sloppy.

168
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,650
A bossy CEO can only be observed from a distance, but not touched.

169
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,880
Yang Xiaoyang, you shouldn't think about this so much.

170
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,210
You should think about this instead.

171
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,970
I got it, Meng.

172
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,990
Now, I'm just like Mr. Liu's name.

173
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,550
I'll cherish my stay here while I can.

174
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,790
Bossy CEO? Forget about him.

175
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,560
Meng, how's the thermos cup project?

176
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,420
I've handed the proposal to Mr. Qiu. I'm waiting for him to notify me.

177
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,350
Mr. Lu already reprimanded Mr. Qiu because of the RV park incident.

178
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,220
Mr. Qiu is very petty.

179
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,440
He might make things difficult for you.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,130
Mr. Qiu, are you getting off work?

181
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,210
- What's the matter?
- Have you read my proposal?

182
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,820
I have.

183
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,770
Do you need me to alter anything?

184
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,630
The project discussion with Locke went extremely well.

185
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,440
If possible, we should do a follow-up as soon as possible.

186
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,110
If not, the project might be taken.

187
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,050
Ning Meng, I'll be honest with you.

188
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,170
It's good that you're being optimistic about this project.

189
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,880
- But this project isn't worth our investment.
- But why?

190
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,140
It's because your point of view is too simple.

191
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,350
Please enlighten me.

192
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,390
Ning Meng, you should think twice before you ask questions next time.

193
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,820
Some questions are meant to be asked while some aren't.

194
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,920
This isn't your university.

195
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,940
I'm not your lecturer.

196
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,570
Hello?

197
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,610
Mr. Wang.

198
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm heading down right now.

199
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,300
Wait for me in the car.

200
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,500
<i>We'll order the usual three dishes at our usual place. Is that okay with you?</i>

201
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:35,695
<i>[Joint Capital]</i>

202
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,120
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Ning Meng.</i>

203
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,230
Our boss said he's going to keep 10% of the investment quote for you guys.

204
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,720
<i>What do you think? Isn't he great?</i>

205
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you for that.

206
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,350
If you need to know more about our company's situation, just tell me about it.

207
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,560
You're trying to rush me, aren't you?

208
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,760
You're too clever.

209
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,200
But seriously, our boss is paying great attention to our cooperation with Joint Capital.

210
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,890
I understand. I'll update you as soon as possible, okay?

211
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,210
<i>Okay, goodbye.</i>

212
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,300
Okay, goodbye.

213
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,100
If you have anything to report, you should report it to the leader of your department.

214
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,170
If everyone in the company bypasses their leaders and reports their findings to me,

215
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,340
my company will close down, you know?

216
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,830
Mr. Lu, I'll just take up 10 minutes of your time.

217
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,200
Please take a look at this.

218
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,780
And the thermos cup, too. I...

219
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,010
Do I look free to you?

220
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,280
Ning Meng, you should be clear

221
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,210
that only the executives and my secretary

222
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,450
are the only people who can enter this office

223
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,905
and report their findings to me.

224
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,815
Who do you think you are?

225
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:35,855
If you were still my secretary,

226
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:40,095
I could listen to your ideas.

227
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,765
If so, I don't have anything to report then.

228
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:51,765
Take your stuff and leave my office.

229
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:59,935
Please give this thermos cup a try.

230
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:04,045
I still have the same advice for you.

231
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,955
You won't succeed in doing investments.

232
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,345
What gives you the right to say that?

233
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:13,605
Back then, I thought being a secretary wasn't my thing.

234
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:16,615
Even so, I still worked as your secretary for three entire years.

235
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:20,655
Do you think you need any technical skills to be a secretary?

236
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:22,855
Why are you trying to show off your result here?

237
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,435
You want to be an investor?

238
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:28,785
How much do you know about the capital market?

239
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:48,845
What gives you the right to say that?

240
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:50,625
Who do you think you are?

241
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,495
I'll kill you!

242
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:57,005
<i>Enough, Mengmeng. Stop being angry.</i>

243
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:59,705
<i>You'll turn into a lemon if you keep being sour about it.</i>

244
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,635
<i>You're getting more and more professional. Seems like you've been training a lot.</i>

245
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:07,185
It's just that I was always furious.

246
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:10,295
Just quit if you can't take it. I'll support you.

247
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:13,195
<i>You need Old He to support you. How can you support me?</i>

248
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,785
I'm just showing him some respect by letting him do so.

249
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,765
Am I right, Old He?

250
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,035
<i>But of course.</i>

251
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:24,655
<i>I work hard to earn enough money for my baby Qiqi to spend.</i>

252
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:26,455
<i>I'm happy as long as she's happy.</i>

253
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,155
<i>All right, we'll stop rubbing salt into your wound. You guys can continue.</i>

254
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,495
I've already had my fill from swallowing my anger.

255
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:34,155
Stop showing me your lovey-dovey show.

256
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,035
All right, we'll stop here.

257
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:39,735
Speaking of which, Mengmeng, do you really intend to stay there?

258
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,715
<i>Where can I go if I resign?</i>

259
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:43,395
<i>Do you think it's that easy to find a job right now?</i>

260
00:18:43,395 --> 00:18:46,155
At least it's better than your current situation.

261
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:50,935
Are you experiencing Stockholm Syndrome after Mr. Lu tortured you?

262
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:55,135
It's not like the things he said were completely unreasonable.

263
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,135
He said that I bypassed my leader and reported my findings to him.

264
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:00,455
He asked me who I thought I was.

265
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:03,145
Who am I?

266
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:06,375
Good grief. I knew his personality sucked,

267
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,025
yet I still went there and embarrassed myself. I guess I was possessed.

268
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:12,535
<i>It's all because of that Qiu fellow.</i>

269
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,395
<i>If you want to move the process forward,</i>

270
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:18,615
<i>there's no one else you can find besides your boss.</i>

271
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:26,325
You're an angel.

272
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:28,005
You reminded me of something.

273
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:29,955
<i>What did I say?</i>

274
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,735
I got an idea!

275
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:36,925
I got an idea now!

276
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:45,425
Mr. Ren, that's about it.

277
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,955
I hope we can make this project a success.

278
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,325
I'm willing to give up on its profit.

279
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:54,255
If you need me for anything, I'm willing to give my full cooperation.

280
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,155
I can see that you've spent a lot of effort on it.

281
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,525
This project is pretty good indeed.

282
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,355
Do you really think so?

283
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,865
Ning Meng, I do think it's pretty good.

284
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:08,225
However, it's not that I don't want to help you out.

285
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:10,555
But for Investment Department I to take over Investment Department II's project?

286
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:14,075
I think our company has never done that before.

287
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:17,785
I understand. I know I'm causing you some inconvenience here.

288
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:20,735
But Mr. Qiu rejected the project outright.

289
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:22,635
I still feel reluctant.

290
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:27,075
It would be a pity if we let Locke slip away from our fingers.

291
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,595
I have to rush to the airport later for a business trip. I'll only be back during the weekends.

292
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:37,405
How about this? I'll ask my subordinates to review your business proposal.

293
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:41,155
If there's no problem, I'll arrange for someone to be your main contact.

294
00:20:41,155 --> 00:20:44,585
Understood. I'm already very thankful that you're willing to read this.

295
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:45,535
Don't mention it.

296
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,425
We can discuss the details after I return from my business trip.

297
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,865
You should be patient for a few more days.

298
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,965
Okay. Thank you.

299
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,485
Please.

300
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,315
Mr. Lu, it's all thanks to your help.

301
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,655
If not, we wouldn't be able to achieve a breakthrough in our technology.

302
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,985
Now that we've achieved a breakthrough in technology, everything is much easier.

303
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,185
I'm glad that everything went smoothly.

304
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,645
It did go smoothly.

305
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,565
Ms. Shi, I heard from Mr. Lu

306
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,115
that the Financial Department has finished reviewing our company, am I right?

307
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,825
That's right. We can sign the contract if there's no problem after we have viewed the sample.

308
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,085
All right.

309
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,205
Let me thank you for now. Thank you.

310
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:21,025
Mr. Lu, thank you so much. Thank you.

311
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:24,465
Mr. Lu, Mr. Ren needs your confirmation for a document.

312
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:27,705
Why don't you just strangle me? Send it to my WeChat.

313
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:29,425
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:32,835
There's a hall over there.

315
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:35,005
- All of our new products are in there. Let's go and take a look. Okay?
- Okay.

316
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:36,535
Please.

317
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:40,805
Mr. Lu, I remember that Ning Meng was your secretary.

318
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,215
Where did she go?

319
00:21:42,215 --> 00:21:43,935
Ning Meng wasn't happy that she was just a secretary.

320
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,425
She became a breeder at the zoo.

321
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Hello. What would you like?

322
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,700
Mister, one steamed sponge cake and one millet porridge.

323
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,800
Okay, give me a second.

324
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Thank you, I've already paid for them.

325
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Okay, thank you.

326
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,400
Hello, Mr. Ren?

327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
<i>Ning, we've finished reviewing your business proposal.</i>

328
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,800
<i>Everyone thinks that this project is worth following up on.</i>

329
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
That's great.

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,200
<i>I'm free tomorrow.</i>

331
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>You can tell them about this news and arrange for an appointment.</i>

332
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,400
<i>We can talk about the details when we meet in person.</i>

333
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,700
Okay, I'll tell them immediately!

334
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,300
Max, I have good news!

335
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,900
Our investment director is very interested in Locke.

336
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
We can proceed with the project.

337
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,700
<i>Didn't he already come here?</i>

338
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,700
<i>I was wondering why you didn't follow him.</i>

339
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,300
Who was it? When did it happen?

340
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,900
<i>I think it's a director with the surname Qiu.</i>

341
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,000
- You mean Qiu Junlin?
<i>- That's right. It's him.</i>

342
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,500
<i>But I don't know about the contract details.</i>

343
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>Our boss communicated with him back then.</i>

344
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
<i>The news we had received was that he'd be in charge of the rest of the project.</i>

345
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,400
Ning Meng, did something happen at your side?

346
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Don't you know about this?

347
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm just glad that we can proceed with the project.

348
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,100
I got it. See you.

349
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,900
Mr. Qiu, didn't you say you weren't going to make a bid for Locke Thermos Cups?

350
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Can't you knock before entering?

351
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,900
What do you mean by that? Since when did I say that I wasn't going to make a bid for that project?

352
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,600
You said so personally in front of the elevator back then.

353
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,100
Are you serious? Was the proposal you handed to me Locke Thermos Cups?

354
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,200
You don't say? Did you experience amnesia?

355
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,000
Listen to me. It's like this.

356
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
A friend of mine at a consulting firm

357
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
recommended Locke Thermos Cups to me.

358
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,900
They just finished researching its market.

359
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,000
They realized that this company had potential.

360
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,600
- I just studied it for a short while. I realized that...
- You don't need to explain yourself.

361
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,300
Why don't you admit that you stole my project?

362
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
Fine, I admit.

363
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,400
I admit I did brush you off.

364
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,200
I admit that I judged you without reading your proposal.

365
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll apologize to you.

366
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,000
From today onward, no matter what project you hand to me,

367
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,600
I will read them seriously, word for word.

368
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Is that okay with you?

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Look at you.

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,200
You should be grateful that you're talking to me.

371
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
I could discuss this matter with you as an equal

372
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,000
without making a huge fuss over it.

373
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
What if you were talking to someone else today?

374
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,900
You would've bitten off more than you could chew.

375
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,000
Qiu Junlin, you're shameless.

376
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,500
I know you're furious right now.

377
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,700
<i>[Investment Director]</i>
You feel upset, right?

378
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,600
I had no choice either.

379
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm not the owner of Joint Capital.

380
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,300
I can't just ask anyone to do the stuff I want them to do.

381
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,200
Our big boss, Mr. Lu,

382
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,400
transferred you to Investment Department II to train you. I welcome you with my all heart.

383
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,200
Our department welcomes you with all our hearts, too.

384
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,000
However, if you feel unhappy staying in our department,

385
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,300
you should back off. Okay?

386
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,400
Mr. Lu, were you calling for me?

387
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm printing the documents right now. I'll send them to you later.

388
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Who asked you about the documents?

389
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,500
What's wrong with Investment Department II?

390
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,900
Just now, it seems that someone was arguing in Qiu Junlin's office.

391
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,300
I don't know about the details. I think it's about a project.

392
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,400
He always creates trouble for me.

393
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Go and ask Ning Meng what happened.

394
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Yes, Sir.

395
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Remember, don't tell her that it was me.

396
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,800
Understood, Mr. Lu.

397
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Come back.

398
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
How about this? You should go and check if this is a serious matter.

399
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
If this is very serious and Ning Meng cannot resolve it by herself,

400
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,000
use your own way to persuade her

401
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,500
to come back and be my secretary.

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
I don't mean anything else.

403
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,400
I just think that Ning Meng is an old employee of mine.

404
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
You know my personality, too.

405
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,400
Yes, Mr. Lu.

406
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm willing to give her one last chance.

407
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,100
All right, Mr. Lu. Consider it done.

408
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,000
You stinky, shameless scoundrel!

409
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,500
Just you wait!

410
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Ning Meng, are you okay?

411
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,400
What happened? Did you argue with Mr. Qiu?

412
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,300
It's nothing.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,300
Meng, if one day...

414
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
I mean "if".

415
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,200
If you really can't stand Qiu Junlin,

416
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
will you consider being Mr. Lu's secretary again?

417
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,500
Meng, if you do go back, I'm sure Mr. Lu will back you up and deal with that Qiu fellow for you.

418
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,100
Mr. Lu said you were an old employee and he...

419
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,500
Yang Xiaoyang.

420
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,300
If I return to his side, I'm a pig.

421
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,700
Okay.

422
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,000
Was that what she said?

423
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
That's right.

424
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,700
For the color, you need to lower the saturation level of blue and green.

425
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,200
Sorry about that.

426
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Hello, Ning Meng?

427
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Hello, Max?

428
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,800
I've already discussed the issue with the company.

429
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,200
It was a procedural problem.

430
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,500
Everything is fine now.

431
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,400
Are you really okay?

432
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Just tell me if you need any help.

433
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm fine,

434
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,400
but I do need your help for something.

435
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,500
The email that Mr. Qiu and Mr. Zhang used to send their contracts has malfunctioned.

436
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
They couldn't log in to their email no matter what.

437
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,700
How about this? I'll send you a new email address.

438
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
Please send a copy to me.

439
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,000
<i>No problem. It's a piece of cake.</i>

440
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Okay, thank you.

452
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Ning Meng, I was looking for you.

453
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,900
- Now that I think about it, regarding the Locke project...
- Mr. Ren, I'm sorry.

454
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,400
Something might be wrong with the project. I'll explain it to you later.

455
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,700
Mr. Lu, I know I shouldn't do this,

456
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,400
but please look at this before you reprimand me.

457
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,900
You want me to look at this? What do you want me to do?

458
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,600
Something's wrong with Qiu Junlin.

459
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
He's sabotaging the company's profit.

460
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
Look.

461
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,500
Regarding the project with Locke, he went into the contract discussion straight away

462
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500
without telling the company about the project.

463
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,900
And Locke promised that they would allocate 10% of the investment quota to Joint Capital.

464
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,200
But on the contract, it only states 8% of the quota.

465
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,800
Where did the other 2% go?

466
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,200
And this company, Baixiang Venture Capital,

467
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,400
they're making a bid for Locke's project, too.

468
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,400
I've done some research on them. Their legal person is Zeng Yan.

469
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Zeng Yan has another identity. She's the wife of Qiu Junlin.

470
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
That means Qiu Junlin is swallowing the rebate using a roundabout way.

471
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,600
Ning Meng, instead of doing investments,

472
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,000
you're trying to be Sherlock Holmes in the Investment Department?

473
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,300
Mr. Lu, don't you think you're concerned about the wrong thing?

474
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,400
Do you think I need you to tell me that?

475
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You've been working in the Investment Department for so long,

476
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,600
but have you completed any projects?

477
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,100
The four most basic steps in doing a project: gathering bids, making bids, managing the projects, and completing them.

478
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,000
Tell me. Which of them is your expertise?

479
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
You see, Qiu Junlin...

480
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,900
Can you stop mentioning Qiu Junlin in front of me?

481
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,500
Can't you do your own part?

482
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,800
So do you feel proud that you're a little bit better than that low achiever?

483
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,200
Ning Meng, let me ask you this.

484
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,600
What else can you do besides finding the loopholes in our management?

485
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,000
Mr. Lu, I always thought that you were a strict boss

486
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,500
who protected your bottom line and didn't encourage the development

487
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,200
of bad tendencies within the company even though you had a short temper.

488
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,600
But now, it seems like I was wrong about you.

489
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
Who do you think you are?

490
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,300
Ning Meng, if I didn't give you the opportunity to be transferred to another department,

491
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,200
you would have no chance to touch even the door handle to the Investment Department.

492
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,500
Go and ask around.

493
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,300
Which company in our industry would let a secretary take charge of their projects?

494
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,900
- Go and ask around.
- Is that so?

495
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,200
Are you sure you gave me a chance to handle the projects?

496
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Or did you make things difficult for me on purpose so that I could come back and be your secretary?

497
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,000
Look at the way you're talking to me.

498
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,400
Do not gauge the heart of a gentleman with your own mean measure.

499
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
You're blaming others for your ineptitude.

500
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,800
Ning Meng, didn't I tell you before?

501
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,300
Not everyone can work in the investment industry.

502
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,400
Handling a project isn't as simple as you think.

503
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,800
If there's nothing else, you better get out.

504
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
All right.

505
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
From now on, you won't need to worry about me.

506
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
I won't hinder you again.

507
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
I quit.

508
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
You want to quit?

509
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
You've been using quitting as an excuse

510
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,000
to threaten me time and time again since last month.

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,400
Do you think that Joint Capital cannot function without you?

512
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,200
You better not regret your decision.

513
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Don't worry. This time, I'm quitting for sure.

514
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Locke is a worthy project.

515
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,800
Please treat it rationally.

516
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,700
Meng, you mustn't act on impulse!

517
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,000
It might make you regret your decision!

518
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,200
Calm down! Meng, you must calm down!

519
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,600
Take a deep breath!

520
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Meng, you...

521
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,400
Meng, you mustn't do this.

522
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,200
Life is just like a show.

523
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,700
We gather because of fate.

524
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,000
It's difficult for us to stay together.

525
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,600
You mustn't be angry at your boss.

526
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,400
It's meaningless when you think about it.

527
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,800
A great person is magnanimous.

528
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Therefore, you shouldn't hold it against him.

529
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,900
That's the kind of person he is. Everyone in the company knows that.

530
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,600
Yang Xiaoyang, what are you doing?

531
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,300
Meng, what should I do if you quit?

532
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm serving a tiger!

533
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm afraid! You...

534
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,800
Meng, please stop this.

535
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Liu Yitian, handle her resignation. Ask her to scram!

536
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,500
- Whose resignation do you mean?
<i>- Who else?</i>

537
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,100
You should at least wait until you had received this month's wage, okay?

538
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,600
- Ning Meng.
- Meng.

539
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,800
Mr. Liu, please persuade her! She...

540
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,500
Ning Meng, if there's an issue, we can resolve it together.

541
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,800
You mustn't make up your mind when you're being impulsive.

542
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm partly responsible for this, too.

543
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Regarding Mr. Lu, I'll deal with him for you.

544
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,300
Mr. Liu, there's no need for that. I've already made up my mind.

545
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,400
Ning Meng, do you know how risky it is for you to quit without finding a job?

546
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,300
Moreover, the golden recruitment period is already over.

547
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,200
It's fine. Please don't worry about me.

548
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,000
I can survive.

549
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,700
Xiaoyang, take good care of yourself. I'll treat you to a meal next time.

550
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,300
Mr. Liu, you should drink more water.

551
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
That way, it can cure your kidney stones.

552
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,600
Thank you for taking care of me. I'll make a move now.

553
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,900
- Ning Meng, you should think twice.
- Ning Meng, you're quitting?

554
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
That's great. You should experience the outside world.

555
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,100
Don't forget your old colleagues here when you've made it big in the future.

556
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,300
Don't worry.

557
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,800
No matter who I forget, I'll never forget about how you "nurtured" me.
