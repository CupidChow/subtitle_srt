00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,660
Wait for a while.

169
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,560
No, don't bother.

170
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm done.

171
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,100
Amazing.

172
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,300
Mr. Lu, thank you for today.

173
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,260
Sour Orange, do you lack exercise?

174
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,800
What is your body made of? You are so weak.

175
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,460
You fell ill so easily.

176
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,180
You're right.

177
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,580
Sitting in the office chronically has affected my health.

178
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,260
Look at you.

179
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,080
When you were my secretary, you had never taken any sick leave.

180
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,500
You walked 10,000 steps a day.

181
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,580
You were in pink health.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Do you remember when we went to Singapore the year before last for a financial forum?

183
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,020
I actually pulled an all-nighter to write your speech

184
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,740
while having a 38.5-degree fever.

185
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,940
You were down with fever back then?

186
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,660
I want to take a nap.

187
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,540
Well, Mr. Lu, why don't you go back and get some rest?

188
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,340
What is this? Getting rid of me?

189
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,200
I was kind enough to bring you to the hospital.

190
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,820
Driving me away after taking your medicine?

191
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,120
No, it's not that.

192
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,900
Isn't it already late now?

193
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,720
You need to work tomorrow.

194
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,260
And the point is I'm unaccustomed to you being here.

195
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,200
Unaccustomed? That applies to me more.

196
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm afraid of being infected.

197
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,880
There's cold medicine. Take some to prevent a cold.

198
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,480
Not bad. You can argue with me now.

199
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,720
You've recovered, right?

200
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,780
Let's leave then. Come on.

201
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,220
Why didn't you finish it? Bottoms-up.

202
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,960
Give me some face.

203
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,140
Urging me to bottoms-up?

204
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,780
I just wanted to moisten my throat. I'm not thirsty.

205
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,860
I'm not asking whether you're thirsty or not.

206
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,320
You caught a cold. Drink more hot water.

207
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,220
Don't you know?

208
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,660
All right. I'll drink later.

209
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
Who's ill here? You or me?

210
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,600
Who's worried here? You or me?

211
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm like a back-seat driver...

212
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,260
Yes, I'm a back-seat driver.

213
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,940
It's your call.

214
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,320
Ning Meng, shouldn't you think about

215
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
how to repay my kindness?

216
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,720
In the future, you must come to pick me up when I'm drunk.

217
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,160
You mustn't refuse.

218
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,620
Cook some noodles for me when I'm hungry.

219
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,620
You mustn't complain.

220
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,060
And about Shi Ying, you must...

221
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,700
What are you doing?

222
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,840
Running away while I'm asleep?

223
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm going to the restroom.

224
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,240
Go ahead.

225
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,280
Shorty.

226
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,380
♫ <i>I'm not that pitiful for I still have you</i> ♫

227
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,200
This is called concentration, an essence.

228
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,240
I can't see the essence. You read too many jokes.

229
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,380
Life is hard. Can't I read some jokes?

230
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,020
♫ <i>I'm not so curious except for thinking of you</i> ♫

231
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,300
Your fever has dropped.

232
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,460
Just take the medicine, and you'll be fine.

233
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,380
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

234
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,020
You have a good body constitution.

235
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,260
You're recovering pretty fast.

236
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,200
Do you need to examine other parts?

237
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
Will there be any consequences?

238
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,360
Don't worry about this.

239
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
It was only a common cold that triggered the fever.

240
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,180
Watch your diet after this.

241
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,760
- Replenish some nutrients.
- Okay.

242
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,440
♫ <i>There is a natural radian in your smile</i> ♫

243
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,800
♫ <i>The unintentional practice of gentleness</i> ♫

244
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,860
Mr. Lu, it's okay. You don't have to see me off.

245
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,060
Really.

246
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,220
Look. I'm full of energy.

247
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,240
Don't misinterpret it.

248
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,200
Did I say I'm seeing you off?

249
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,480
Hello.

250
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,000
Give me a room on the second floor.

251
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,680
Okay. There's a vacancy.

252
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,220
You're staying here?

253
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,120
Is there any issue?

254
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,980
Zeng Yuhang isn't around today.

255
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,920
I'm bored being alone.

256
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,440
This is an express hotel.

257
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,800
I know.

258
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Why else would I hand her my identity card? To go online?

259
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,980
Will you be able to withstand it?

260
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,720
Not afraid of bugs anymore?

261
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,800
You can stay here. So can I.

262
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,560
I just want to move here.

263
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
Are you convinced?

264
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm indeed convinced.

265
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,480
You moved in a hurry just to hear me say this?

266
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,920
Ning Meng,

267
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:35,260
don't you think your illness has seriously affected your work progress?

268
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,860
Well, shouldn't we work overtime every day now?

269
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,680
Don't you think it's a waste of time for me to go from the hotel to the factory area?

270
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,000
Do I have so much time for you to waste?

271
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,240
I feel a bit dizzy. Why do I have tinnitus?

272
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,380
Stop your act.

273
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,160
Didn't you say you were full of energy?

274
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,500
I get it now.

275
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm physically sick, but you're suffering emotionally.

276
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,760
That's good then.

277
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,080
Thank you.

278
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,180
Mr. Lu, didn't you talk about working overtime? This is it?

279
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,540
Who told you that I'm not working?

280
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,420
Did you ignore everything I told you?

281
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:34,900
Due diligence isn't just about the data, but also the people.

282
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,940
Yuan Jie was a top student through and through.

283
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,380
He furthered his studies in the States right after graduating from high school.

284
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,240
He has a double major in finance and mathematics.

285
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,740
MFE from Boston College?

286
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,420
Master of Financial Engineering.

287
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,480
Yuan Jie was a science student.

288
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,580
He's sensitive to numbers and possesses strong logic.

289
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,580
But as for his actual operational and management capabilities,

290
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,780
we still need to observe him more.

291
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,100
The data looks good so far.

292
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,900
But these are from his former boss.

293
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,980
Yuan Jie took over Phoenix for only less than a year.

294
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,680
This data doesn't tell much.

295
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,060
You just recovered. Don't exert yourself.

296
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,300
Take a break.

297
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,100
What do you want for dinner?

298
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,820
Let's order delivery.

299
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,920
Take a look at what's available then.

300
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,180
Take a look at what you want.

301
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,860
What are these? Edible?

302
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,260
They don't look nutritious.

303
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,920
What about I take a cab back to the hotel and get some food from there?

304
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,380
I can bring my luggage over, too.

305
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,180
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lu.

306
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,740
By the way, do you have any cravings?

307
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,260
I have no appetite.

308
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,240
Get me some soup then. Chicken soup.

309
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,300
Anything else?

310
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,620
Vegetables. But don't cook with oil.

311
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,180
Just something light.

312
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,420
Also, if there are fruits and desserts, that'd be even better.

313
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,260
For fruits, get them cut if possible.

314
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
It's more convenient to consume.

315
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,300
I'll get you some milk tea, too?

316
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,180
Okay.

317
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,240
Watch your weight.

318
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,340
<i>The seeds.</i>

319
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,600
Liu, nibbling on seeds while listening to an audiobook? How free and easy.

320
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,980
What else can I do?

321
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,780
I can only live it day by day.

322
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,960
Who knows how tomorrow will be? That's right.

323
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,180
- Seven yuan.
- All right.

324
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,200
- Liu, I'll get going then.
- Okay. See you.

325
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,580
Buying so many snacks for beer?

326
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,140
For water.

327
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Not getting some beer, too?

328
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,860
What's your bestseller?

329
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,880
That one is good.

330
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,480
This?

331
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,080
Sir, your business looks quite good.

332
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,540
It's still manageable now,

333
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,780
but not in the near future.

334
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,440
Why?

335
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,000
Our factory is going to lay off workers.

336
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,140
How many people do you think

337
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,020
will come here after the layoff?

338
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,260
Young lady, you're not from our factory. Right?

339
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,520
I'm from another factory.

340
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
I'm here to gain some experience.

341
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,160
What's there to learn?

342
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,860
The workers will be laid off soon.

343
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,180
How will they settle the workers being laid off?

344
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,220
Our factory is also undergoing restructuring.

345
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
I'd like to learn something from this.

346
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,900
What can you learn from it?

347
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,780
Retrenchment involves paying some severance pay

348
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,060
to send the workers away.

349
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,920
How much would it cost for retrenching many workers?

350
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,420
Let me tell you.

351
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:01,680
Our Mr. Yuan junior is very good at calculations.

352
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,140
He wants to refer some of the workers to other factories.

353
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,440
Mr. Yuan junior has been negotiating with the factory

354
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,120
my nephew is working in.

355
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,700
If the re-employment issue is solved,

356
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,180
he will save a fortune in severance pay.

357
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,260
But does this work?

358
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,020
How many people can those factories take in?

359
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,760
How would I know?

360
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,500
Anyway, Mr. Yuan junior took such a drastic measure

361
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,340
as soon as he took over the office.

362
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,680
He upgrades everything to smart technology.

363
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,940
Isn't the technology advanced now?

364
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,300
Technology evolves faster.

365
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Smart technology is a big trend.

366
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,760
There are opportunities for you, young people.

367
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,860
But what about those old workers?

368
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,700
They will be jobless.

369
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,080
Who knows?

370
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,160
They might apply smart technology to my store soon,

371
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,460
transforming it into a self-service store.

372
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,780
I'll be eliminated then.

373
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,380
It's 78 yuan in total.

Who told me that besides data, we have to investigate the people in due diligence, too?

383
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,480
I deliberately paid a secret visit to a store in the factory area.

384
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
What are you talking about?

385
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,420
Why did you go there?

386
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,080
It's a news-gathering place.

387
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,060
Tell me. Who heard the most gossip in this factory area?

388
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,060
It's the storekeeper.

389
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,260
Many people visited the store.

390
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,760
It's a natural intelligence station.

391
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,200
Tell me then. What information did you get?

392
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,500
The storekeeper said that Yuan Jie wanted to refer most of his workers

393
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,200
to other factories for re-employment.

394
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,180
It doesn't sound reliable.

395
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,200
I've made some estimations upon return.

396
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,180
If the factory is fully updated to the smart system,

397
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:32,140
the number of the retrenched workers

398
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,480
will be much higher than planned.

399
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,300
If Yuan Jie indeed implements this,

400
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,700
there will be a hidden risk.

401
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,580
Without a sufficient budget

402
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,420
for such a large-scale takeover and placement,

403
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,700
a large number of retrenched workers

404
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,220
will not receive any reasonable arrangement.

405
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,460
It sounds risky to only rely on the other factories for the takeover.

406
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,940
Right?

407
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,580
Let's dig in first.

408
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,280
We'll continue the discussion after dinner.

409

It is because automation and smart upgrades

<i>- Really.</i>
- I understand how you feel.

486
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,660
I know it feels bad to be eliminated.

487
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,680
But the survival of the fittest is the never-changing rule of this world.

488
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,620
Competition makes progress.

489
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,060
It's a natural selection.

490
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,200
In primitive societies, those who ran slowly would be eaten by wild animals.

491
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,700
Only those with the genes to run the fastest would survive the longest.

492
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,500
I've also gone through countless selections and eliminations to get to where I am today.

I understand why you're blaming me.

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,380
You were born into a good life.

496
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,160
You were the winner before you were born.

497
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,360
That's right! You already gained victory before you were born.

498
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,400
You may not understand some issues.

499
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,440
But you must remember that I've given each of you a chance.

500
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,360
I'm making proper arrangements for those who are eliminated.

501
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,900
I'll try my best to get the other factories to hire some of you.

502
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,300
There's a place for everyone.

503
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,180
In this world,

504
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,380
the fittest will survive.

505
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,300
Mr. Yuan.

506
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,900
Mr. Lu.

507
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,760
My apologies.

508
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,000
I've made a fool of myself.

509
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,620
Let's talk in your office.

510
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,920
Okay.

511
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,340
Thank you.

512
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,520
- I'll help myself.
- Mr. Lu.
- I'll help myself.

513
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,780
Okay.

514
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,540
Mr. Lu, this is the previous design.

515
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,260
We've come up with a new plan.

516
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,820
I'll send you an electronic version.

517
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,980
It looks good.

518
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,700
Let's sit and talk.

519
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,620
Mr. Yuan, the due diligence is complete.

520
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,420
We've decided to abandon the investment for now.

521
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:14,880
Mr. Lu, may I know your reason?

522
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,940
I think there are some issues with the placement of the retrenched.

523
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,220
I've checked it out.

524
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,720
It's very unlikely that you'll be able to arrange employment placement

525
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,320
for the retrenched.

526
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,160
Mr. Lu, be rest assured. I've solved this issue.

527
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,580
Let's talk about technology.

528
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,960
Do you think there's a loophole in it?

529
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,260
The technology is fine.

530
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,300
The issue lies in the people.

531
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,180
I think the placement of the retrenched workers is the key issue.

532
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,560
Have you considered this?

533
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,240
Will the severance pay for the retrenched increase?

534
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,560
Will there be issues of labor disputes and legal compensation?

535
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,420
It's all about corporate image.

536
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,700
It's a risk.

537
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,780
It's a hidden risk we, the investors, will take into consideration.

538
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,420
Mr. Yuan, I know you didn't mean to keep these issues from us.

539
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,620
But based on the budget you prepared,

540
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,680
the amount allocated for human resources is too low.

541
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,980
If you're not able to arrange placement for the retrenched,

542
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,100
you should increase the severance pay.

543
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,100
In fact, this should be included in the labor cost.

544
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,260
It shouldn't be ignored.

545
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,900
Yes.

546
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
It's my mistake.

547
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,580
I cared too much about technology.

548
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,900
And I have firmly believed that technology could replace human labor immediately.

549
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,020
Unexpectedly, the issue lies in the people.

550
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,540
Mr. Lu, if I can solve the placement issue properly,

551
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,860
would you change your mind?

552
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,280
♫ <i>Is there a fable</i> ♫

553
