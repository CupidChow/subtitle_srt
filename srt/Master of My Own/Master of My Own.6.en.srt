163
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,530
Why is the project of Locke Portable Kettle reported by Ning Meng?

164
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,920
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

165
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,190
The staff made a mistake in sorting.

166
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,180
This is not supposed to be in the proposed project file.

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,150
Was Ning Meng in charge of this project?

168
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,890
Yes.

169
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,090
Why is the project of Investment Department II in your department?

170
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,850
Mr. Lu, allow me to explain.

171
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,650
The Locke Project was filtered out by Investment Department II.

172
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,630
But Ning Meng thought this project was worth following up on.

173
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,950
She wanted to work on it.

174
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,460
But it was denied by Mr. Qiu when proposed.

175
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,110
Ning Meng thought this project was very good.

176
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,260
And she put a lot of effort into it.

177
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,230
She went to the company to make a lot of improvements.

178
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,880
She couldn't let it go.

179
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
So she showed it to me.

180
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,460
Keep talking.

181
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,860
We read this proposal as well.

182
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,510
It was well written.

183
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,190
But Ning Meng told us suddenly that this project couldn't go on.

184
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,550
We don't know why either.

185
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,210
I get it. Please leave.

186
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,080
Okay, I shall go now, Mr. Lu.

Long time no see.

193
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,240
Did you prepare for the questions I gave you?

194
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,740
Later, we'll just skip the basic stage

195
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,400
and meet the director of the department.

196
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,500
So fast?

197
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,020
You're internally recommended.

198
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,960
Besides, I've introduced your situation.

199
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,580
Boss is quite interested in you.

200
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,540
- Just do your best.
- Thank you.

201
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,740
- Let's go.
- Sure.

202
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,110
What you provided are some industry research and analysis reports.

203
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,750
I can tell that your analysis and logical skills are good.

204
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,860
However, I can't see your competence in the investment field so far.

205
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,060
Have you joined any specific cases?

206
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,090
Before I resigned from the job,

207
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,650
I did my first project proposal.

208
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,360
I thought I did it quite well.

209
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,940
But this project...

210
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,140
This project was filtered out?

211
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,090
The project ran smoothly.

212
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,590
Because the contract was just sealed

213
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,200
and the trade secrets of my previous company are involved.

214
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,480
Hence, I'm sorry that I can't show the proposal to you.

215
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,100
Would you trust my words?

216
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,730
Why not?

217
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,460
In our field, integrity is very important.

218
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,050
Ning Meng, what you did is right.

219
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,660
I've interviewed over a hundred people.

220
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,090
To be honest, there are many people who have

221
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,520
better qualifications than you.

222
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,840
Your resume is relatively normal.

223
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,030
Can you please tell me what your specific strengths are?

224
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,330
My strength is perhaps normality.

225
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,590
What do you mean?

226
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,920
Compared to elites, I understand normal people better.

227
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,230
I also think about the problems from the standpoint of the mass consumer.

228
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,330
If it's possible, I want to focus on consumer goods.

229
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,900
Because in this track, normal people are the biggest market.

230
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,940
He asked you if you wanted to work here?

231
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,050
That's great. We'll be colleagues soon.

232
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,790
Wang Yao, these documents need your approval.

233
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,760
Leave them in my office.

234
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,950
Okay.

235
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,580
You have an office?

236
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,960
I started here right after graduation.

237
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,420
It has been three years.

238
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,780

- This is our big boss.
- I still have an international conference.

240
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,640
- I shall leave you here.
- Okay.

241
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,880

242
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,830

- See you.

244

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,210
I'll contact you if there's any news.

250
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,790
What else can it be?

251
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,370
You are quick with searching for a replacement.

252
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,050
Can you not be so mean, Mr. Lu?

253
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,030
Am I?

254
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,790
That's because I see unkind people like you everywhere I go.

255
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,450
You haven't gone downstairs?

256
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Do you think the new environment can change you?

257
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,420
Mr. Lu, haven't you heard that proverb?

258
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,430
"Oranges cultivated in Huainan will be oranges,

259
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,610
but in Huaibei, they become bitter oranges."

260
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,310
Being unkind or not isn't my problem.

261
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,460
It's a matter of the environment.

262
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,510
I don't think the environment here is good.

263
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,160
You can't even get a cab during peak hours.

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,640
I think after you face some difficulties,

265
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,300
you'll come crawling back to Joint Capital.

266
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,160
Can't get a cab?

267
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,330
Where are you going? I'll have him give you a lift.

268
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,930
No, I mean I'll have Song give you a lift.

269
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,350
No, thank you.

270
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,760
I'll start working here soon. I want to get to know the way.

271

Up to you.

272
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,380
Go ahead and just stab me to death!

273

I was having fun in Europe.

274
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,130
You called me back so you can turn me into a sieve?

275
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,390
Investigate someone for me.

276
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,980
Did I come back just to investigate someone for you?

277
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,460
Tell me. Who do you want me to investigate?

278
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,610
We have a cunning person in the company.

279

Is there a problem? I'll give you some advice.

Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

Something is wrong with you.

He just tells other directors a few words,

326
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,400
and all my efforts are in vain.

327
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,900
No way, Sister Meng.

328
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,400
You see, you should first calm down.

329
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Although Mr. Lu has an ill temper,

330
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
he's generally upright.

331
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
He doesn't look like a mischievous person.

332
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Who had the biggest reaction after I left?

333
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,000
Mr. Lu, of course.

334
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,800
That's the answer.

335
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
That's right.

336
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,500
Who am I?

337
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm a small potato that's smaller than a dust particle.

338
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,200
He's a big boss.

339
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Why must he go against me?

340
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,200
Why is he making things difficult for me?

341
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,400
All right, all right, Sister Meng.

342
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,600
By the way, do you want to give Ms. Shi's Eaglestone Capital a shot?

343
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,100
She was asking about you after knowing your resignation.

344
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
I would like to.

345
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
However...

346
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,000
Isn't Ms. Shi's company still within Lu Jiming's sphere of influence?

347
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,400
I can't afford that.

348
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,200
All right. It's good to stay further away.

349
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Out of sight, out of mind.

350
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,800
So that you don't get into this kind of problem again.

351
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,680
That's enough, Sister Meng.

352
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,500
Don't.

353
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,300
Okay, I'll drink too. I'll drink too.

354
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,000
No. I can't stomach this insult.

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,100
Don't let me see him again, or else...

356
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,400
How dare he call me?

357
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>[Lu XX]</i>

358
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,200
Mr. Lu, what's up?

359
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
<i>Your resignation letter was lost.</i>

360
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,100
<i>The resignation procedure was canceled.</i>

361
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,800
You're still an employee here.

362
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Get back to work tomorrow.

363
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,200
What did you say?

364
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,800
I think you can't find any good job.

365
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,000
I'll forgive you.

366
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Should I thank you?

367
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,320
<i>Ning Meng,</i>

368
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,000
deal or no deal. Get it?

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,900
Don't you realize I'm letting you off the hook?

370
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,400
Be grate...

371
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,300
Be grateful, right?

372
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Have you ever done me any favors?

373
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,600
How can you ask me to be grateful?

374
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,200
Sister Meng, you...

375
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Lu Jiming, have I ever done you wrong?

376
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,300
I've been your secretary for three years.

377
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
Don't I deserve some credits?

378
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,400
Why don't you spare me?

379
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,400
I worked so hard to look for a job,

380
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,800
yet you blocked everything so easily.

381
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Ning Meng, are you okay?

382
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,700
Have you been drinking?

383
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,200
Who are you?

384
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,100
Who are you to arrange others' lives?

385
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,600
Why are you playing tricks behind me?

386
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,400
No. Ning Meng, explain yourself.

387
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,500
What trick did I play?

388
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,600
Do you think I'll surrender just like that?

389
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,900
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.

390
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,000
Play all the tricks you have up your sleeves.

391
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Use them on me.

392
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,000
<i>Let me tell you, Lu Jiming.</i>

393
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,490
<i>One day,</i>

394
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:51,200
I'll make you call me Ms. Ning.

395
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,000
Hello?

396
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,300
What are you doing?

397
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,700
<i>[Add Lu XX to the blacklist? Confirm]</i>

398
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Oh my, that must have been an illusion.

399
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,020
<i>[Ning Meng (Secretary)]</i>

400
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,870
<i>[Ning Meng, do you have to go against me? / Message sent but rejected by receiver]</i>

401
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
How dare you block me?

402
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,100
Who gave you that courage?

403
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>Mingming, who made you angry?</i>

404
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,700
Why are you here?

405
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Look. My new dress.

406
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Are you still mad at me?

407
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,400
I bought you a gift to apologize.

408
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,000
Why would I be angry with you?

409
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
I got it now.

410
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,600
It was my mistake to be your secretary.

411
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Well... How's my RV Park project?

412
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
It's stopped.

413
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I advise you not to get involved.

414
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,900
Why?

415
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,600
The risk is too great.

416
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
Why is it great?

417
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
For this project, I've worked hard for months

418
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
and paid a lot of effort.

419
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Let me tell you. First, the project itself takes up a lot of cash flow.

420
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Second, the prospect of the market is uncertain.

421
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,300
The investment return takes longer.

422
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,400
Do you understand?

423
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I don't.

424
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,200
You're being official with me.

425
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,800
It's because Ning Meng said in her report that the risk was too great,

426
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,600
so you believe her.

427
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
What does a secretary know about investment?

428
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm explaining to you what the risks are.

429
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

430
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,200
What did I say?

431
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,800
Did you have to scream at me?

432
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
Why did I scream?

433
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,000
You talk from day till night.

434
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,700
You talked about everything. But is any of them useful?

435
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,400
My words aren't useless.

436
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Which line is useful?

437
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't get involved in things which are out of your field.

438
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,800
I advise you, don't touch anything relevant to investments.

439
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,700
You don't know anything.

440
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,200
Lu Jiming, talk properly.

441
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,500
Am I not talking properly? Am I not speaking the truth?

442
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,200
Everyone has his expertise.

443
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
You're in charge of being pretty and happy.

444
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,300
Be a rich pretty second generation.

445
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,000
That's good for everyone.

446
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,900
What's going on?

447
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,400
You don't have to act like this.

448
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,100
Lu Jiming, you're so mean!

449
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- You...
- What are you doing here?

450
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Didn't you tell me to investigate Old Qiu?

451
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay, I'll leave.

452
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,100
You're mean indeed.

453
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,800
Tiantian, get into the car.

454
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,400
You've been walking so long in high heels. Aren't you tired?

455
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,300
Aren't your legs sore?

456
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm tired.

457
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,100
Don't cry.

458
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
The moisture of the moisturizing facial mask is gone now.

459
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,300
Here.

460
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,800
You're more attentive, unlike Lu Jiming.

461
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,700
Lu Jiming has gone too far.

462
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll scold him for you.

463
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,900
Lu Jiming, you've gone too far.

464
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,000
We've been friends for many years.

465
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm done with your ill temper.

466
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
It's your fault this time.

467
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,700
You must apologize to Tiantian, get it?

468
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
I've avenged you.

469
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,900
Why is the flight mode on?

470
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,900
I don't have time for the rascal.

471
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,800
Do you think...

472
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm laughable?

473
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,000
He used to criticize me about this and that.

474
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
I pretended like I didn't care.

475
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
Because I like him.

476
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
But today he said that I'm just another pretty face.

477
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,200
That was too much.

478
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,500
Is that the impression I give?

479
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
No.

480
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
You've worked so hard for the RV Park Project.

481
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
When you were battling with other directors

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,800
you weren't like a princess at all.

483
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,300
I'm not as capable as you.

484
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,000
But I just wanted to complete a project successfully.

485
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't want you to think that I'm a brainless person who only knows how to spend money.

486
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,700
I also don't want you to think

487
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm someone who only relies on my dad

488
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,200
and doesn't know anything else.

489
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,300
I... Wasn't I working hard?

490
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,300
Tiantian, I don't know how to advise you regarding relationships.

491
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,900
But regarding the project, I would like to talk to you about it.

492
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
If you want to succeed in a project,

493
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,600
you can't just give up after listening to others' criticism.

494
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,500
If Lu Jiming doesn't treat you as a friend,

495
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,800
he wouldn't be so honest with you. Right?

496
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,300
Look at Ning Meng.

497
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
No.

498
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
I didn't mean to annoy you by mentioning her.

499
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Look at Ning Meng. She really has an unbeatable strength.

500
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,500
We have to admit that. We have to learn from her.

501
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm done.

502
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,200
Why are you staring at me?

503
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,900
I'm not used to you being so serious.

504
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,000
What about this?

505
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,100
Irritating.

506
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,400
I'm not a therapist for free.

507
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,600
You've to pay the consultation fee.

508
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
Dream on.

509
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,000
I'm hungry.

510
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
Let's go home.

511
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,200
All right.

512
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,400
The handsome boy is here at your service.

513
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,100
<i>[Ning]</i>

514
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,830
Dad, what's up?

515
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,020
<i>Can't we just talk?</i>

516
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,300
<i>You haven't called home for so long.</i>

517
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,110
I was busy.

518
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,930
How was it? You resigned, right?

519
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,710
How do you know?

520
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,840
<i>When your mom called you the last time,</i>

521
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,690
<i>she heard someone ask you in for an interview.</i>

522
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,590
Her hearing is so good.

523
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,320
<i>Don't you know her hearing?</i>

524
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,920
Even when I whisper to you, she can join in.

525
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,250
Was it successful?

526
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,940
<i>It was okay.</i>

527
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,790
What do you mean it's okay?

528
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,610
It's either yes is yes, or no is no.

529
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,050
Don't listen to the bad things online

530
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,630
about telling your parents the good news only.

531
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,980
It depends on the matter.

532
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,450
If you talk about such matters to us,

533
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,860
perhaps I can give you some ideas.

534
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,540
I'll be honest with you.

535
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,380
Things aren't going so well.

536
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,300
I resigned from the secretarial job.

537
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,040
So I looked for other jobs.

538
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,090
I would love to work in investment.

539
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,230
But I attended more than 10 interviews.

540
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,420
The results weren't good.

541
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,600
<i>Mengmeng.</i>

542
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,000
<i>Are there only a dozen of investment companies in this country?</i>

543
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,010
No.

544
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>That's it.</i>

545
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
<i>Don't stop at these dozen of companies.</i>

546
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,840
<i>If it doesn't work in Shanghai, there are Beijing and Shenzhen.</i>

547
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,870
<i>I remember my daughter to be smart and optimistic.</i>

548
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,720
<i>She's also very sturdy at some point.</i>

549
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,190
<i>Such a small obstacle can't beat you.</i>

550
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,070
They don't want you, that's their loss.

551
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,220
You just have to be brave and do it.

552
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,490
Do whatever you like.

553
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,710
When you're tired, just come home.

554
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,590
We'll sustain you.

555
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,730
All right.

556
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:02,030
This is nothing, right?

557
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,550
Go to bed early. Okay.

558
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,330
Ask Mom to go to bed. Stop watching TV series.

559
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,690
I have to sleep soon, too.

560
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,600
Tomorrow morning, I'll be energetic again.

561
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,820
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

562
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,140
I've talked to Tiantian.

563
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,670
Next time you see her, be nice to her.

564
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:46,050
It's okay if you don't like her.

565
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,460
But don't say such mean things. Right?

566
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,730
Stop the nonsense.

567
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,680
How was the investigation?

568
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,380
I've investigated thoroughly. And I looked up Prosperity Capital and the others.

569
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,370
You're right.

570
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,700
<i>[2% of the share]</i>

571
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,700
Mr. Lu, are you looking for me?

572
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,840
- Sit.
- Okay.

573
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,050
What's wrong? Is your neck aching?

574
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,920
Muscle strain.

575
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,750
Yes. The pressure in our company is great.

576
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,930
Mr. Qiu, it has been hard.

577
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,090
But you can't just think about buying houses.

578
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:59,870
When you're sick, you should get yourself checked by a good doctor.

579
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,830
Don't save the money.

580
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,750
Mr. Lu.

581
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,860
This project is good. Did you find it?

582
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,670
Yes, I found it.

583
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,270
How did you find it?

584
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,350
A friend of mine recommended it.

585
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,430
He told me this company has great potential for development.

586
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,220
So I accepted this project.

587
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,050
I see that the agreements have all been reached.

588
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,200
Let me explain it to you.

589
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,210
Here's the case. This is a small project.

590
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,180
Didn't you mention it in the meeting?

591
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,620
We shouldn't consult you on such small projects

592
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,720
because you're busy.

593
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,520
This project is really good.

594
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,180
But the share isn't big enough.

595
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,930
As you said, it's a small project.

596
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,560
We have 8% of the share.

597
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Is the number 8 for an auspicious reason?

598
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,650
I remember, according to the usual standard,

599
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,400
Joint Capital should at least have a share of 10%.

600
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,680
Right, Qiu?

601
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,100
Yes.

602
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,570
When you came to our company,

603
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,600
you brought in a few interesting projects.

604
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,020
Joint Capital has its success because of your help.

605
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,340
Not really.

606
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,010
I understand you want to earn money.

607
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:20,060
You founded Baixiang Venture Capital with your wife

608
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,410
and I chose to neglect it.

609
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,670
But, Qiu, don't you think you

610
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,950
are being a little too greedy now?

611
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,570
Not only did you co-invest in these projects,

612
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:42,300
but you also replaced the processing factory with your good friend's factory.

613
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,600
It's as if you're taking money right from my pocket.

614
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,490
Do you think I'll ignore that?

615
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,300
Mr. Lu, it's my fault.

616
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,680
Pack your things and leave today.

617
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,900
No, Mr. Lu.

618
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,070
I admit I made some money.

619
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,730
But this doesn't stop me from earning for the company.

620
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:10,060
I've been working on projects conscientiously for the company for years.

621
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,800
Have you been working on them conscientiously?

622
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,230
I think you were just working conscientiously to snatch them.

623
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,230
Didn't you snatch Locke Portable Kettle Project from Ning Meng?

624
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,130
Old Qiu, after all, you're a senior in investment.

625
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:31,370
Snatching projects and stealing proposals.

626
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,730
The most laughable part is that you didn't change a word.

627
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,210
Don't you find this embarrassing? Even I feel embarrassed for you.

628
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,900
Mr. Lu, you can't just...

629
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,970
You can't just listen to Ning Meng's one-sided words and fire me recklessly.

630
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,710
A person can be greedy but not stupid.

631
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,320
You can be petty but not evil.

632
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,090
All right, Lu Jiming.

633
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,420
Let's stop pretending.

634
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,170
I know you don't like Ning Meng.

635
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,810
You always wanted her out of the company.

636
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,320
Okay. I helped you to get rid of her.

637
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,180
And now what? After she left, you're getting back at me?

638
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,040
Qiu Junlin, are you out of your mind?

639
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,290
Do you think you know me so well?

640
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,170
Do you believe that I can use your trick

641
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,910
to slander Ning Meng on you?

652
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,060
♫ <i>You have to bid farewell when the time comes</i> ♫

653
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,280
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

654
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
♫ <i>Watching the fallen leaves, listening to the wind</i> ♫

655
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,520
♫ <i>Saying that all colors have luster</i> ♫

656
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,820
♫ <i>Don't want to be bullied, to be brushed off</i> ♫

657
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,120
♫ <i>And to be treated like a fool</i> ♫

658
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,520
♫ <i>Breaking through the laws of the world</i> ♫

659
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,280
♫ <i>And reconnect with the sacred heart</i> ♫

660
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:19,020
♫ <i>Every time I ever loved</i> ♫

661

♫ <i>Every little thing we gain in life</i> ♫

662
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,820
♫ <i>Comes with huge obstacles</i> ♫

663
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:34,320
♫ <i>Fallen leaves, fall in love</i> ♫

664
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,240
♫ <i>There's no so-called happy ending</i> ♫

665
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,000
♫ <i>Just make your decision with bravery</i> ♫
