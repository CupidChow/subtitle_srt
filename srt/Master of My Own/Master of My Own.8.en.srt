Mr. Lu, why are you here?

No.

6
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,100
I should be the one asking you that.

7
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,040
Ning Meng, have you been stalking me?

8
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,980
I'm not stalking you.

9

No. Well, I live here.

Mr. Lu, do you think I work for her for the money?

32

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,290
The company has a financial problem, right?

99
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,480
There's nothing wrong with their finances.

100
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,140
Are you trying to trick me into telling you the answer?

101

We've been together for three years.

102

Don't think that I don't know you at all.

103
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,730
If you had really found out the answer, you wouldn't have to call me on purpose.

104
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,300
If it's not a financial problem, then there should be nothing wrong with the sales amount then.

105
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,220
Not necessarily.

106
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,660

it's easy.

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,240
Work as my secretary again. Then, I'll tell you the answer.

111

I can always tell if you are lying or not.

114
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,000
I didn't work for nothing in those three years.

115
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,400
Ms. Shi, I was looking for you.

116
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,460
I found out that there's an issue with Cozap's sales amount.

117
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,430
What did you find?

118
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,660
Take a look.

119
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,210
Their report looks good.

120
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,590
But all of the franchise owners have similar signatures.

121
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,950
It's like they were all signed by the same person.

122
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,410
The signatures are quite similar.

123
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,050
So, I double-checked their phone numbers and names through Alipay.

124
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,990
The information doesn't match.

125
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,140
And two-thirds of the information is fake.

126
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,230
After that, I found the real contact information of their franchise shops

127
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,300
and called each owner one by one.

128
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,760
All of them gave me similar answers.

129
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,500
It feels like they are hiding something.

130
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,240
This is very fishy.

131
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Are you sure that the sales amount is the issue here?

132
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,560
Although they have the same answers, their plan is not foolproof.

133
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,260
I purposely called a few shops that were more secluded to coax the answers out of them.

134
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,500
And I found out that their sales amount doesn't match.

135
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,370
And two of the shops are already closed.

136
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,180
But their sales amount is still being updated.

137
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,840
Not bad. You are quite sharp.

138
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,500
Besides...

139
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,480
Besides, I had inquired about it from another source of mine.

140
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,630
Anyway, Ms. Shi, I believe in my judgment.

141
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,540
Okay. We'll go to Cozap's headquarter now to tell them about our discovery.

142
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,800
Now?

143
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,150
Yes. Speed is the best asset.

144
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,400
We don't have to give them notice.

145
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,700
We'll catch them off guard.

146
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,750
If we give them notice beforehand, they'll have time to plan.

147
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,910
Understood.

148
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,310
I feel so guilty for letting you pay us a visit yourself.

149
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,400
Mr. Zhao, you are too kind.

150
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,140
I really look forward to your performance in Q4.

151
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,760
Hopefully, we can collaborate next time.

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,920
Of course.

153
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,380
Just wait for our good news.

154
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,280
Bye. Have a safe journey.

155
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
You want to ask me

156
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,710
why we had settled it so peacefully when I told you

157
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,180
that I would catch them unawares, right?

158
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,460
I was shocked.

159
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,230
Did you notice his expression when I said

160
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,780
I was not going to invest?

161
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,080
At that very moment, he had already realized that we had noticed the issue.

162
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
We are intelligent people.

163
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,230
There are things that we don't have to say.

164
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,330
We went there to tell them about my decision.

165
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,890
Not to fight them.

166
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,280
There's a saying

167
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,920
that young people use... about not exposing someone.

168
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,950
Do you mean "Life is hard enough, no need to expose others' secret"?

169
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,370
Although it's not that accurate, the meaning is similar.

170
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,150
You'll understand with experience

171
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,440
that this kind of thing is quite common.

172
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,560
Even if we can't collaborate with each other,

173
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,960
it doesn't mean we have to make an enemy out of them.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,670
Very good.

175
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,720
Eaglestone Capital is a new force in the world of investment.

176
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,690
We are able to achieve so much in such a short time

177
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,160
because of your cooperation and diligence.

178
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,680
I'm really grateful to all of you.

179
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,570
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,140
Actually, to become a good investor,

181
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,590
apart from having sharp eyes for discovering potential clients,

182
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,790
more importantly, you need to have the capability to discover hidden trouble

183
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,310
in time to negate the risk.

184
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,020
Ning Meng did very well in this Cozap project.

185
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,800
She managed to find out the data that they were trying to conceal

186
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,480
and saved our company from any losses.

187
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,670
It was nothing, Ms. Shi.

188
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,380
I just made a few calls.

189
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,400
Don't be so humble.

190
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,160
When someone faked the sales amount,

191
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,350
it wouldn't be so easy to spot if you were not meticulous and smart enough.

192
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,980
Ning Meng is new here. But she has already proven herself.

193
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,210
That's amazing.

194
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,890
Let's put our hands together for her.

195
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,690
I'll continue to work hard.

196
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,450
Mr. Lu, Ms. Shi has replied to us.

197
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,410
They have already rejected the Cozap project.

198
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,300
They've also warned us that we have to be cautious if we want to take on the project.

199
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,240
Did they tell us why?

200
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,910
I think it's because Ning Meng discovered a major issue with it.

201
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,330
A hidden issue that is hard to be discovered.

202
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,380
Okay.

203
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,470
If Cozap approaches us, reject them.

204
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,450
I'm not interested in this project anyway.

205
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,550
Understood.

206
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,170
Mr. Lu, Ning Meng is amazing.

207
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,400
She managed to discover such a difficult issue.

208
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,460
If she didn't find out, Ms. Shi might have invested in this project.

209
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,910
- From...
- Are you done?

210
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,910
Is your mouth rented?

211
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,910
Do you feel that it's a waste if you don't talk?

212
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,690
No.

213
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,080
You are quite clever.

214
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,700
Ms. Shi, you are looking for me?

215
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,180
Ning Meng, come. Sit.

216
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,840
You've done well lately.

217
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,730
Looks like I have a keen eye.

218
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,500
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

219
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,000
This is a project from Baoyi Goldsmith Co., Ltd.

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,840
asking for a capital increase and share expansion.

221
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,000
This company is a prestigious company in the industry.

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,880
They want to increase their authorized capital

223
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,740
before they become a listed company.

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,640
So, they want to find some new shareholders.

225
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,720
Usually, for this kind of project, it'll always be profitable.

226
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,610
And it won't take long.

227
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,610
This is a great opportunity.

228
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,600
I am going to let you handle this mission.

229
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,890
You'll work on this together with your previous company.

230
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,510
With Joint Capital?

231
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,670
You know the people there.

232
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,890
Besides, you'll fit right in.

233
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,790
Is there a problem?

234
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,180
No. Ms. Shi, please continue.

235
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,140
The overall structure of our investment is like this.

236
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,980
Joint Capital and us, will have a joint general partnership.

237
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,780
And then, we'll build a joint foundation.

238
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,580
After that, we'll create an asset management product through a trust fund.

239
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,150
Do you understand the structure?

240
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,180
Yes. We can only use the money inside the trust fund

241
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,530
to invest in projects that are related to private placement.

242
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,300
That's why we need an asset management plan

243
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,140
so that we can invest in stocks that will be issued in private.

244
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,135
Not bad. You are more and more like an investor now.

245
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:25,625
Your mission is to go through the documents with our LP,

246
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,945
speed up the process and take care of the details.

247
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,675
Okay.

248
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:31,965
I'll get going now.

249
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,605
Hello?

250
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:03,915
Mr. Lu, I am Ning Meng.

251
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,775
What is it?

252
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,130
<i>Ms. Shi asked me to</i>

253
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,000
interface with you regarding the capital increase and share expansion project from Baoyi Goldsmith Co., Ltd.

254
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:14,185
After this, I'll work on the project together with Joint Capital.

255
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:16,785
She said that she had already informed you about it.

256
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:22,885
Mr. Lu?

257
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:27,785
Yes. She had informed me about it.

258
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:32,435
But now, in what capacity are you reporting to me?

259
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,895
<i>Have you forgotten about the basic rules now that you are in a new company?</i>

260
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:40,285
How can you report straight to the boss of another company?

261
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:44,665
I'm calling on behalf of Ms. Shi

262
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,575
to inform you about the progress of the project.

263
00:17:47,575 --> 00:17:50,295
We are honored to be able to collaborate with your company.

264
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:52,765
Stop acting all official on me.

265
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:57,285
Mr. Lu, after this, I'll be in touch with the Project Department.

266
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,025
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now.

267
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:00,645
Wait.

268
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,765
Haven't you forgotten something?

269
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:05,075
What is it?

270
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,025
About the Cozap project.

271
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,645
Don't you think you should thank me?

272
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:11,885
I discovered that issue myself.

273
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:13,965
Stop lying.

274
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,285
You tricked the answer out of me.

275
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:16,825
You've wronged me.

276
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:19,305
I already knew the answer before I called you.

277
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,535
I just called you to confirm the validity of the issue.

278
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,925
Not bad, Ning Meng.

279
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,585
You've learned how to be ungrateful.

280
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,475
You are too kind. Bye, Mr. Lu.

281
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,815
Please wait.

282
00:18:48,815 --> 00:18:50,475
Thank...

283
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:55,525
What is it? Finish the sentence.

284
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,375
You are really ungrateful.

285
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:15,855
Mr. Lu, why are you blocking my path?

286
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,825
Nothing.

287
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:21,305
I just want you to thank me properly.

288
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,055
It's not much, right?

289
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,225
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

290
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,065
Can you be more sincere?

291
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,600
Thank you for your help. Thank you for your guidance. Thank you for being so selfless.

292
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:33,715
I'm done now. Is that sincere enough?

293
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,675
You are really bold now.

294
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,585
I think I'm okay.

295
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,595
After all, I don't get my salary from you anymore.

296
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:44,665
Why didn't I realize that you could have such a sharp tongue?

297
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,805
You were really good at acting, Ning Meng.

298
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,255
Let me tell you.

299
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,395
You were being deceitful and fake.

300
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,835
To survive, all humans have to be a little bit fake. Right?

301
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,415
I'm different.

302
00:19:56,415 --> 00:19:57,905
I've never faked myself in front of you.

303
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,855
Maybe you are not a human then.

304
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,305
Ning Meng, say that again.

305
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,485
If you stop me again, I'll call the police.

306
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,215
Go ahead.

307
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,865
How dare you threaten me with that. Go ahead.

308
00:20:17,705 --> 00:20:19,435
Hello?

309
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,585
Ning Meng, why are you so evil?

310
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,405
How can you call the police?

311
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,535
<i>It'll be cloudy tomorrow.</i>

312
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:30,675
<i>There'll be thunderstorms in certain areas.</i>

313
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:32,475
Bye, Mr. Lu.

314
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,855
Just you wait, Ning Meng!

315
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:50,705
Why didn't you tell me before you came here?

316
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:54,475
I was hit. I was just about to go and find you.

317
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,515
Fake.

318
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:57,025
Humans are so fake.

319
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,185
Why are you scolding me?

320
00:20:58,185 --> 00:20:59,625
Who are you calling fake?

321
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,515
Did I say it was you?

322
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,085
Why do you look so guilty?

323
00:21:04,085 --> 00:21:06,135
I was talking about your neighbor.

324
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,135
What did Ning Meng do again?

325
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,525
After this Sour Orange quit,

326
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:13,725
she changed into another person.

327
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:15,855
She's like a stranger now.

328
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:18,025
When she was my secretary,

329
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:20,025
she was so gentle and obedient.

330
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,905
But in the end, it was just an act.

331
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:27,435
It turns out that she has never been good or obedient.

332
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:28,575
She's so rebellious.

333
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:33,305
Why are you so harsh on Ning Meng?

334
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,815
Why not?

335
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:37,005
I want to see how different she can be.

336
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:38,985
Enough, Twisted Lu.

337
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,805
Let's talk about business.

338
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:43,425
I want to ask you. Have you been working on a capital increase and share expansion project

339
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:45,905
together with Shi Ying lately?

340
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,445
How do you know?

341
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:48,915
I was about to talk to you about it.

342
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,225
It's possible that Tiantian may take part in it.

343
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,705
Why would she?

344
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,355
Back then, a company called Yuanyuan Real Estate

345
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,405
went to her about the RV park project.

346
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,945
She had high hopes for this project.

347
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:02,135
She wanted to become a GP to prove herself.

348
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:04,455
She asked you to invest in it but you didn't. Right?

349
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,005
And her father refused to help her.

350
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:08,515
She doesn't want to give up on it.

351
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:11,655
She found out that Shi Ying is looking for an LP for this project.

352
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:14,285
So, she wants to pull Yuanyuan in

353
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:16,085
so that they can earn some money.

354
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:20,465
After this, they can still continue with the RV park project.

355
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,455
Has Shi Ying agreed to it?

356
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:24,375
You know that they are close.

357
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,505
Moreover, Shi Ying is clever.

358
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:31,145
She won't give up this chance to do Tiantian a favor.

359
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,415
Is Yuanyuan Real Estate reliable?

360
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,625
We still have to assess it.

361
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,505
Mingming, don't be so prejudiced against Tiantian.

362
00:22:40,505 --> 00:22:43,915
Although she is reckless, she means well.

363
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:47,335
She's quite cute when she's being so serious.

364
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:50,865
Zeng Yuhang. You are acting weird.

365
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:57,185
Have you fallen in love with Xu Sitian after going to Europe with her?

366
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:03,355
Do you think I'm insane?

367
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,715
Stop with this nonsense.

368
00:23:09,275 --> 00:23:10,605
Let me ask you.

369
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:14,095
Don't tell me that you'll be dealing with Ning Meng this time.

370
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:19,995
It must be hard on Ning Meng.

371
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:22,305
It wasn't easy for her to switch to another company.

372
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:25,185
But she still can't escape you.

373
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:28,805
She still has to work under you.

374
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:36,555
What did you send me again?

375
00:23:36,555 --> 00:23:39,625
<i>You'll know after you open it.</i>

376
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:45,515
<i>Surprise! Is it nice?</i>

377
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,555
<i>Wear them and show me.</i>

378
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:50,335
But it's too tall.

379
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,755
<i>It's meant to be taller. That way, you'll look more poised.</i>

380
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,225
<i>You are not a secretary now.</i>

381
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,625
<i>Don't always dress up like a nun. Okay?</i>

382
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:59,735
<i>Now, you've taken off your glasses. And you've changed your outfit.</i>

383
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:03,875
<i>After you wear the heels from me, you'll be a new woman.</i>

384
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,805
<i>Hurry up and wear them.</i>

385
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,315
This...

386
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,405
I'll try them on first.

387
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:17,715
Let me take this call first.

388
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:22,915
Mr. Ren.

389
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:25,815
Ning Meng, you are a totally new person now.

390
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,945
I heard that Eaglestone had sent you to interface

391
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:31,085
with us as our joint GP partner. Am I right?

392
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:32,365
Yes.

393
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,785
You are being too kind.

394
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:39,280
If there's no issue, let's sign the collaboration agreement.

395
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:43,525
Mr. Lu has asked for you to come here personally

396
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:47,965
<i>so that we can go through the content of the collaboration agreement together.</i>

397
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:51,335
<i>If there's any problem, we can solve it face-to-face and at once.</i>

398
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:55,425
That way, we don't have to waste our time going back and forth with the articles.

399
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:59,705
Mr. Ren, I don't think it's necessary.

400
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:02,255
Our company already has a template for joint GP, right?

401
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:04,965
You can send it to me. And I can ask our Legal Department to go through it.

402
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:08,425
If there's no problem, I can deliver it to you by mail after we stamp it.

403
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:11,595
After that, you can ask Mr. Lu to go through the OA stamping process.

404
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,905
Then, you can just deliver it back to me. Right?

405
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:17,905
Ning Meng, can't you just do me this favor?

406
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:20,375
You know Mr. Lu's temper.

407
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,435
If I tell him that you are refusing to come here,

408
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:25,415
<i>he'll scold me for sure.</i>

409
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:29,645
Are you really going to sacrifice me?

410
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:35,305
All right then.

411
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,045
I'll go there tomorrow, Mr. Ren.

412
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:39,265
Okay. See you tomorrow.

413
00:25:39,265 --> 00:25:40,805
Bye.

414
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:48,270
<i>You have to go back to your previous company to meet your ex-boss?</i>

415
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:52,245
I don't want to hurt those innocent bystanders.

416
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:55,685
I can already imagine the way he mocks me when I meet him tomorrow.

417
00:25:55,685 --> 00:26:00,695
He'll lean back on his chair and look at me with his nose.

418
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:03,435
"You are here, Sour Orange."

419
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:06,505
<i>Will he make it difficult for you in this project?</i>

420
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,225
I don't think so.

421
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:14,835
Although he's childish, he's quite professional.

422
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:16,535
<i>Why are you worried about it then?</i>

423
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:22,045
<i>In my opinion, now is the time for you to regain your pride.</i>

424
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,725
Regain my pride?

425
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:26,345
<i>It's like meeting your ex-boyfriend after you break up with him.</i>

426
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:30,775
<i>You need to let him know that you are doing much better without him.</i>

427
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:33,605
<i>Listen to me. When you go there, put on some beautiful make-up,</i>

428
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,515
<i>wear your most dazzling outfit,</i>

429
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:37,155
<i>put on the heels that I gave you,</i>

430
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,765
<i>and march in with your head held high.</i>

431
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,345
Sister Ning Meng.

432
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:04,905
Sister Ning Meng, I miss you so much!

433
00:27:04,905 --> 00:27:07,545
After you are gone, I have no one to eat hotpot with.

434
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,455
I'll treat you to a hotpot next time.

435
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:11,495
How's the new company? Does Ms. Shi treat you well?

436
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,305
Yes. Ms. Shi treats me really well.

437
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,685
She has given me a lot of opportunities to stretch my wings.

438
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:16,065
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

439
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,785
I'm so happy for you, Meng.

440
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:20,145
Why does it feel like you've grown taller?

441
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:21,135
Ning Meng.

442
00:27:21,135 --> 00:27:23,115
Mr. Ren.

443
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:26,605
I was right yesterday. You've gone through a metamorphosis.

444
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,245
You are too kind. I'm here to discuss the contract.

445
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:31,265
There's no rush.

446
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:32,575
Mr. Lu is in his office.

447
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,475
Go and greet him.

448
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:37,395
Go on. I'll wait for you in my office.

449
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:39,245
- Okay.
- Go.

450
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:41,675
Meng, I have some work to do. I'll see you later.

451
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:43,905
Okay. Go and do your work.

452
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:46,905
You are here, Ning Meng. Hello.

453
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:50,655
Fatty, Zhang. Hello.

454
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:52,405
Ning Meng.

455
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,645
Ning Meng.

456
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,915
Mr. Liu.

457
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:02,425
Let me take a look at you.

458
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:04,055
You've become prettier.

459
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:05,600
<i>Liu Yitian.</i>

460
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:08,090
<i>Liu Yitian.</i>

461
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:10,685
You are here to see Mr. Lu, right?

462
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:13,315
Come. Let's go in together.

463
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:16,025
How did you organize the documents?

464
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,745
Have you learned nothing from Ning Meng?

465
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:20,195
Why can't you get better at this?

466
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,065
Mr. Lu.

467
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,835
Mr. Lu.

468
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,685
You are wearing heels now?

469
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:47,905
Get me a glass of water.

470
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:50,355
I'll get it now.

471
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,405
Have a good chat.

472
00:28:58,085 --> 00:29:02,015
Mr. Lu, I'm here to give you my greetings.

473
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:05,945
After that, I won't disturb you from getting on with your important work.

474
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,255
I'll go and work on the contract now.

475
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:11,705
The floor is slippery. Don't twist your ankle.

476
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:16,495
You are done already?

477
00:29:16,495 --> 00:29:18,505
Go now.

478
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:22,020
No.

479
00:29:22,775 --> 00:29:25,570
Ning Meng has changed so much.

480
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:28,315
Redo this properly.

481
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,175
Ning Meng?

482
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,905
Ms. Xu.

483
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,325
Why are you here?

484
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:51,945
You are now working under Shi Ying, right?

485
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:53,455
Our company and Joint Capital

486
00:29:53,455 --> 00:29:55,205
are working on a capital increase and share expansion project.

487
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:58,105
I am the representative from Eaglestone.

488
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:03,455
You are really enjoying calling it your company.

489
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,765
Shi Ying sent you here?

490
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:12,800
Why did you take off that pair of grandma glasses?

491
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:18,325
Besides, this outfit doesn't suit you at all.

492
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,775
Mingming.

493
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,985
Talk properly.

494
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:46,245
Mingming, look at me.

495
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,265
What is it?

496
00:30:47,265 --> 00:30:49,495
Look at me.

497
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:51,385
Do I look nice today?

498
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,905
I've used the mermaid eyeshadow palette today.

499
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:54,935
Look.

500
00:30:54,935 --> 00:30:57,395
It's nice.

501
00:30:57,395 --> 00:31:00,485
Hey, you are just brushing me off.

502
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:03,005
Tell me then. Which part is nice?

503
00:31:07,185 --> 00:31:09,805
This bag is nice. What brand is it?

504
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,665
Lu Jiming, are you senile?

505
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:15,030
This is the birthday present that you asked Zeng Yuhang to give me last year.

506
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:20,465
That's right. I forgot.

507
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,560
Why are you here?

508
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:31,015
- You know that I've introduced Yuanyuan Real Estate to Shi Ying as her LP candidate, right?
- Yes.

509
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:33,385
I'm here to talk to you about that.

510
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:37,055
If you agree, I'll temporarily forgive you

511
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:38,805
for that RV park project.

512
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:41,815
An RV park is different from a capital increase and share expansion.

513
00:31:41,815 --> 00:31:44,385
Don't put them together.

514
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:45,885
They are not different.

515
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:48,745
For me, they are the same.

516
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:50,505
You and your father won't invest in me.

517
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:52,395
So, I'll just find other investors.

518
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,355
As long as Yuanyuan and I succeed in the capital increase and share the expansion project,

519
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,840
they will be willing to invest in me.

520
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:00,445
Mingming, I beg you.

521
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:02,265
Fine.

522
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:03,585
But let me be clear.

523
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:06,145
This will be strictly business.

524
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:08,645
Okay. No problem. It's a deal then.

525
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:10,535
You are the best, Mingming.

526
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:12,800
Don't touch me.

527
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:15,835
Do you know who I saw just now?

528
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,155
Who?

529
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:19,180
I saw Ning Meng.

530
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,315
She left?

531
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:25,515
I can't believe Shi Ying did this. Why did she choose her?

532
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:27,795
Ning Meng is just a newbie in Eaglestone.

533
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:29,915
But she lets her handle this kind of major project.

534
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:33,745
You didn't see how different she looks now.

535
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:37,185
In the past, she was so out of style and invisible.

536
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,785
Her demeanor has changed now that she has switched her job.

537
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:42,125
She even talks to me differently now.

538
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:47,605
Hello? Ren Pengfei.

539
00:32:47,605 --> 00:32:50,505
Hurry up and give me the contract if it's already signed. I have a business dinner tonight.

540
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:53,165
If you don't give it to me, when will I have the time to go through it?

541
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:55,615
Okay. Hurry up.

542
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,375
I'm super busy with my work today. I have to get back to work now.

543
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,185
I'm done here.

544
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:04,175
Get back to your work then.

545
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:32,845
- Hello?
<i>- Ning Meng, who did you learn it from?</i>

546
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,215
You came to our company to go through the contract.

547
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:39,325
But you didn't even notify the boss when you left.

548
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,445
Where are your manners? Don't you know the rules?

549
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,325
Mr. Lu, you said this yourself. Right?

550
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:47,535
Someone like me shouldn't go straight to you. Right?

551
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:51,475
What's wrong? Do I have to report to you again?

552
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:55,695
You should at least know basic business etiquette.

553
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:58,625
I thought that I just needed to greet you once.

554
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,165
I wouldn't dare to waste your precious time.

555
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,955
<i>Work has always come first to you.</i>

556
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:06,260
So, I adhered to your working style and came back here at once to finish up the contract

557
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,080
so that Ms. Shi could sign it.

558
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:11,675
You are getting better and better with your words.

559
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:13,845
Do you feel proud of yourself?

560
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:17,645
Do you think that this project will be a walk in the park?

561
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:20,925
We have you to guide us.

562
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:25,975
Looks like Shi Ying has spoiled you a lot.

563
00:34:25,975 --> 00:34:27,395
It has just been a few months.

564
00:34:27,395 --> 00:34:29,645
But you have been testing me again and again.

565
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:34,895
Fine. In order to sober you up so that you can be more down-to-earth,

566
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:38,505
from now on, you don't have to work with Ren Pengfei.

567
00:34:38,505 --> 00:34:40,005
You'll work with me.

568
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:41,495
What?

569
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,500
<i>[Due to work, I'll temporarily unblock you so that it's easier for us to work together.]</i>

570
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,225
So childish.

571
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:06,425
- Ms. Shi.
- Ning Meng.

572
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:09,465
Joint Capital has already signed the joint GP agreement.

573
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:11,585
We've gone through the contract with Yuanyuan Real Estate as well.

574
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:13,075
Okay.

575
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:16,455
Next, you'll be the go-between of all three parties.

576
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:20,475
I'm going to send you a business card.

577
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:24,905
It's the business card of the assistant of Yuanyuan's chairman, Fang Jian.

578
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:28,135
- You just have to contact him after this.
- Okay.

579
00:35:28,135 --> 00:35:30,745
In the beginning, Yuanyuan will need a lot of data.

580
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:34,515
As for what they need, you can find out from Joint Capital.

581
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,605
The process will be full of nitty-gritty details.

582
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:38,475
You have to be patient.

583
00:35:38,475 --> 00:35:39,905
Don't worry, Ms. Shi.

584
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,345
I'll get going now.

585
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:43,175
Ning Meng.

586
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:47,695
This process will test your communication skills and coordination skills.

587
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:50,545
You'll need those skills in future investments.

588
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:52,005
Master them.

589
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:54,065
If there's a problem, you can come to me.

590
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,845
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

591
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:08,765
Good day. Are you Mr. Fang from Yuanyuan Real Estate?

592
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,815
<i>Good day. Who are you?</i>

593
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:13,755
Hello. I am the intermediary from Eaglestone Capital.

594
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,435
<i>I'm in charge of being the intermediary of this capital increase and share expansion project.</i>

595
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,265
<i>My name is Ning Meng.</i>

596
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,135
Ms. Ning? Hello.

597
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:25,665
We managed to get this project because of Ms. Shi Ying.

598
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:29,175
After this, we'll have to trouble you to work hard for us.

599
00:36:29,175 --> 00:36:31,115
No. Don't call me Ms. Ning.

600
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:33,545
You can just call me Ning Meng.

601
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:37,985
Okay. Ning Meng. That sounds so nice.

602
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:44,365
Ning Meng, what is your position in Eaglestone?

603
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:47,015
I have too many friends on WeChat.

604
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:48,655
So, I want to make a remark.

605
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,805
This is just my personal habit.

606
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:55,125
I am the analyst of the Investment Department in Eaglestone.

607
00:36:56,735 --> 00:36:59,075
An analyst?

608
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:04,185
No wonder you sound so young.

609
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,375
Are you new in the working field?

610
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,225
I've been working for more than three years.

611
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,945
Three years.

612
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:19,745
Hello?

613
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,255
Ning.

614
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:28,565
Are you working under a senior now?

615
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:33,995
<i>How about this? You should open a group and add your senior in.</i>

616
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,205
<i>I'll add our company's subordinates into it as well.</i>

617
00:37:36,205 --> 00:37:39,475
We can just discuss everything in the group. Okay?

618
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:43,055
Mr. Fang, I'm sorry. I don't understand.

619
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:46,415
Ms. Shi asked me to work on this with you.

620
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:48,865
Is that a problem for you?

621
00:37:48,865 --> 00:37:51,785
<i>Or I can ask Ms. Shi about it.</i>

622
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:55,895
Forget it. Ms. Shi is quite busy.

623
00:37:55,895 --> 00:37:59,575
We both know that. It'll be a waste of time to go back and forth on this.

624
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:02,295
How about this? I have a conference call later.

625
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:05,295
I have to hang up now. Talk to you later.

Why are you so inefficient?

00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:14,875
I...

648
00:40:32,545 --> 00:40:34,005
Okay. You can go back now.

649
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:40,665
Mr. Lu. Actually, it's normal for two companies to send documents through the mail.

650
00:40:40,665 --> 00:40:43,505
What do you mean normal?

651
00:40:43,505 --> 00:40:48,525
For me, it's normal to deliver these documents in person.

652
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:52,195
Fine.

653
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:53,495
Do you need anything else?

654
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,385
If there's nothing else, I'll get going now.

655
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,815
Wait.

656
00:40:57,335 --> 00:40:59,895
Get me the due diligence questionnaire, too.

657
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:01,035
Okay.

658
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:03,495
It's not good to sit in the office for too long.

659
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,425
You should exercise more.

660
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:07,565
Thank you for your care, Mr. Lu.

661
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,845
Don't you think it's too much to ask for a DDQ?

662
00:41:15,845 --> 00:41:18,115
<i>I have already sent you a copy of the business license.</i>

663
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:19,735
<i>You can find everything from it.</i>

664
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:23,365
Besides, the company's organizational structure and the national enterprise credit information

665
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:24,985
are all available in the system.

666
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:25,975
You can find them yourself.

667
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:28,515
Why do you need us to fill in the information?

668
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:29,535
It's like this.

669
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:34,105
We need the DDQ for the trust fund and the asset management.

670
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,500
<i>If you can't provide it,</i>

671
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,590
we can't pass the risk management system.

672
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,255
Fine.

673
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:41,225
I got it.

674
00:41:45,675 --> 00:41:47,500
<i>[Lu XX]</i>

675
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:49,645
Mr. Lu.

676
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:53,475
For the financial report, you have to make three copies of it.

677
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:56,305
Don't forget to ask them to stamp them.

678
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:57,765
Okay.

679
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,115
Mr. Lu, do you need anything else?

680
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:02,955
You can tell me so that I can get it from them all at once.

681
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,365
<i>That's it.</i>

682
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,945
<i>[To Fang Jian]
Hello, Mr. Fang.</i>

683
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:19,535
<i>We need three copies of the financial report that are stamped.</i>

684
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:21,195
<i>Thank you.</i>

685
00:42:34,405 --> 00:42:38,915
<i>Ning, if you need anything else, can you tell us about it all at once?</i>

686
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:42,775
Do you think that our company's Finance Department works for you alone?

687
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:48,695
If you keep doing this, it'll cost us manpower and time.

688
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,305
Understand?

689
00:42:56,385 --> 00:42:58,345
<i>[To Fang Jian]
Sorry for the trouble.</i>

690
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,695
<i>It won't happen again.</i>

691
