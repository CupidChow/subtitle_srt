<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,040
Sorry, I'm late.

4
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,710
No, no. You're right on time.

5
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,430
How come those two are together?

6
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,230
Who's that man? You know him?

7
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,050
Have some tea.

8
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,370
Thanks.

9
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,829
I was in a hurry the last time.

10
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,600
I've been meaning to treat you to a meal.

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,070
I thought you only said it to be polite.

12
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,430
Of course not.

13
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,779
But I was too busy previously.

14
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,130
I only got a breather now.

15
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,219
Was the traffic bad on the way?

16
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,700
Yes, I expected a jam but I didn't think it'd be this bad.

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,510
What to do? Today's a holiday.

18
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,669
Did you wait long?

19
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,170
Don't worry about it. I took the time to read a bit.

20
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,200
You can check this book out.

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,700
It's written by a professor at Stanford. It's quite good.

22
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,520
Waitress, menu, please.

23
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,970
<i>[Change]</i>
Thanks.

24
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,440
You must be hungry. Here.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,170
Order your food.

26
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,069
Ning Meng seems different from her usual self today.

27
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,320
But I can't exactly put my finger on it.

28
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,810
Her eye makeup is heavier and the lipstick is different.

29
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,029
What a pro.

30
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,500
Who is that man? He's quite handsome.

31
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,250
No, "handsome" isn't the right word.

32
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,779
It's more of a gentlemanly demeanor.

33
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,150
Gentle and elegant.

34
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,139
No wonder Ning Meng stood us up.

35
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,960
This is why.

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,940
Are you two not going to eat?

37
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,029
You can order.

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,389
Anything is fine by me.

39
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,090
Okay.

40
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,870
Let's order their specialty dishes, then.

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,879
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes.

42
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,920
Then, we'll go with steamed sharpbelly.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,339
This place has really fresh fish.

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,830
They get them from Taihu daily.

45
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,190
Their crab meat lion's head is also spectacular.

46
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,080
The owner used to be a State Dinner chef.

47
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,660
We're at a Huaiyang restaurant,

48
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,420
so we should order their specialties.

49
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,859
In Huaiyang cuisine, you should eat

50
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,979
salted duck, duck three ways,

51
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,749
- sweet sauce duck, duck blood curd, and tofu soup.
- How's that?

52
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:19,360
Mingming, no need to massacre the ducks.

53
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,470
Let me see then.

54
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,459
Tender eel, Taihu crispy eel,

55
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,300
fried eel, herbal fish soup.

56
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,949
Ning Meng resigned more than half a year ago.

57
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,570
Haven't you learned how to order food?

58
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,920
What exactly does the man do?

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,059
He's also an investor.

60
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,420
He and Mingming met at a bar once.

61
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,010
And Mingming got drunk.

62
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,059
That's because I didn't want to deal with him.

63
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,620
We couldn't see eye to eye, so I got drunk as an excuse to leave.

64
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,360
You sure know how to plan ahead.

65
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,499
Wait! You weren't pretending to be drunk that day.

66
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,019
You were really out of it.

67
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,770
You insisted on Ning Meng to go and get you.

68
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,200
Was that how they met?

69
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,701
It can't be that coincidental, right?

70
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,270
Stop guessing. I'll just go over and ask.

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,840
Don't. What are you doing?

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,090
Tiantian, come back here!

73
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,990
Ning Meng!

74
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,920
Hey, you're here too.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,989
When I asked you out, you were being all coy, saying you weren't free.

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,900
I knew something was up.

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,560
Well? Aren't you going to introduce me to this handsome young man?

78
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,179
Hello, I'm Su Weiran.

79
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,260
Hi, I'm Xu Sitian.

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,289
The young man has style. The watch really suits you.

81
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Thank you.

82
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,109
Anyway, what a coincidence.

83
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,950
Mr. Lu and Mr. Zeng are here, too. Over there.

84
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,130
Over there. Mr. Lu is also here?

85
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,200
Hi!

86
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,470
Should we go and say hi?

87
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,200
For what?

88
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,970
You look like you're jealous.

89
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,779
Why would I be jealous? Are you stupid?

90
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,879
Then, why are you being a wuss? What?

91
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,149
Who are you calling a wuss?

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,250
- Let's go then.
- Go on.

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,299
Am I... interrupting?

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,669
Are you two on a date?

95
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,459
No, no. He's my senior.

96
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,650
We met in college.

97
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,550
- What a coincidence.
- Mr. Zeng.

98
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,990
Mr. Lu. We meet again.

99
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,339
We meet again, Mr. Su.

100
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,940
Mr. Lu.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,050
Mingming, I just noticed Mr. Su is taller than you.

102
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,219
What about it?

103
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,560
Plenty of people are taller than me.

104
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,589
I seem to have a great affinity with Mr. Lu.

105
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,339
We couldn't drink to our hearts' content the last time and agreed to meet again.

106
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,950
Who knew we'd bump into each other here?

107
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,499
Right, a coincidence indeed.

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,840
Why don't we eat together then?

109
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,720
Sure.

110
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,019
Okay then. I'll get a bigger table.

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's head this way.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,219
<i>[Change]</i>
Awesome. The more the merrier.

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,280
I'll wait for you there.

114
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,240
I agreed before asking you.

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,339
I hope you don't mind.

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,499
Not at all.

117
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,649
- Let's head over, then.
- Okay.

118
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,340
Let's go.

119
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,610
Here, Ning Meng.

120
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,989
I thought Mr. Su only liked Western food.

121
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,149
Is Chinese cuisine palatable to you?

122
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,609
It's food from home. I craved it when I was in the States.

123
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,569
- Here you go.
- I'll help myself.
- Tiantian.

124
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,899
Eat the fish while it's hot and not fishy.

125
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,179
Thanks, Hanghang.

126
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,380
Food should be picked up by yourself.

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,770
Serving one another will only pass the saliva around.

128
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,220
I'm using the serving spoon.

129
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,499
Mr. Lu is right.

130
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,409
Westerners prefer to eat separately, individual meals.

131
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:56,179
But I think the Chinese eat

132
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,699
not only to fill our stomachs, but it's also more about building connections.

133
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,240
Yes, yes. It's all about sentiments.

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,869
Our Mingming is a weirdo.

135
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,020
He won't get it.

136
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,510
Ning Meng, how did you two meet?

137
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,490
Ning Meng is my junior at university. Same faculty, coursemates.

138
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,190
What a coincidence.

139
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,690
Indeed.

140
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,780
What's more, I only met her again because of you, Mr. Lu.

141
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,730
Is that so?

142
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,879
That time you got drunk, it was Ning Meng and me who brought you home.

143
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,449
That was the first time I met her again after graduating.

144
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,829
Mingming, so you became their matchmaker because you got drunk?

145
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,829
Fate brought us together. Here, let's drink.

146
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:46,469
Come on, drink to the occasion.

147
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,469
Come on, Ning Meng, Handsome.

148
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,739
Happy holidays.

149
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,340
Come on.

150
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,030
Mr. Su, any project you're investing in lately?

151
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,619
If it's okay to tell us, we'd like to learn a thing or two.

152
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,179
Yes, tell us.

153
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,579
At this table, you two are the experts at investing.

154
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,260
The rest of us are amateurs.

155
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,690
Have you seen "Black Mirror"?

156
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,590
There's an episode talking about virtual reality.

157
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,349
Lately, I've been looking into the race between AR and VR.

158
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:22,359
At this point in time, I think it's a good opportunity

159
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:24,270
to dive into human-computer interaction.

160
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,970
Are you talking about 3D glasses?

161
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,659
Tiantian and I did that two years ago.

162
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,800
It's not a new technology.

163
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,979
AR and VR technologies are continuously evolving.

164
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:37,591
Particularly now with a 5G framework,

165
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:40,800
successful application of AR and VR is much more probable.

166
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,620
In a virtual world of intelligent learning and interaction,

167
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,739
we can do things that we previously couldn't.

168
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,110
Handsome, I still don't really get it.

169
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,200
How is this different from immersive technology?

170
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,850
I'll put it this way.

171
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,619
Miss Xu, who is your favorite movie star?

172
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,859
Brad Pitt.

173
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,120
The main differences between them are,

174
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,880
you dream of Brad Pitt, you see Brad Pitt with your own eyes,

175
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,589
and you're with him, dating as a couple.

176
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,909
Hold on, let me go over that.

177
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,600
Dream, see, date.

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,609
I get it now. How much is it? I'll invest.

179
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,619
Are you for real?

180
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,670
Calm down, will you?

181
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,299
Can I pilot a Gundam in there?

182
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,440
You're telling me to calm down?

183
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,789
Mr. Lu doesn't seem all that interested.

184
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,589
Your idea is pretty good.

185
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,069
But it's too bad. The current downstream content is lagging behind.

186
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,029
Meanwhile, the cost of upstream content is too high.

187
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,509
It's not ripe yet to be marketed as entertainment consumer goods.

188
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:47,520
But it's hard to say. There will be rich and naive people like Ms. Xu. They don't really care.

189
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,630
What are you saying, Mingming?

190
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,240
I just mentioned an idea.

191
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
- As for the market positioning...
- Secondly.

192
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,639
Currently, a lot of internet companies are trying to develop the market.

193
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,530
It's more difficult to do it alone.

194
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,739
On one hand, it has to do with content.

195
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,520
On another, it is a matter of technology.

196
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,269
Compatibility is hard to achieve.

197
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:10,480
The idea sounds great, but implementation is difficult.

198
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,200
I think technology and content go hand in hand.

199
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
It's the same principle as "Which came first," the chicken or the egg?"

200
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,500
- There's no need to have a clear demarcation.
- Right.

201
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
If you don't know what you're talking about,

202
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
then just keep quiet.

203
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,100
Saying a bunch of useless fillers. Who taught you that?

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,600
I think what Ning Meng said makes sense.

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,700
Are you sure, Mr. Su?

206
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,500
A late joiner like her.

207
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,800
Are you sure she really gets it?

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Mr. Lu, you probably didn't notice Ning Meng's qualities.

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
I think she has a lot of potential.

210
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,600
I've known she was talented since back in university.

211
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,900
I never said she wasn't talented.

212
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,200
During her three year tenure at Joint Capital,

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,500
Ning Meng did her job well.

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,200
Indeed, she's the best secretary I've ever met.

215
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Ning Meng, get me some tea.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
I asked you to pour me tea.

217
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Didn't you hear me?

218
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,600
Ning Meng, why are you being so dramatic?

219
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,300
- I'll do it.
- No need, Mr. Su.

220
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
I can do it myself.

221
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,200
Lu Mingming, change the subject.

222
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Talk about something fun.

223
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
Was that a downer?

224
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,800
Okay. Let's talk about something nice.

225
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
I read something not long ago.

226
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,400
It was about Napoleon and a skilled cook.

227
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,600
But the cook did not want to just cook.

228
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
He kept wanting to lead men into battle.

229
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Every day, he would cook the best meals

230
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
just so he could be promoted.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,100
Finally, one day, his effort moved Napoleon.

232
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,400
Did you guys think it was an inspirational story?

233
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,700
- Yes.
- Wrong.

234
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,500
It's a tragedy.

235
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Because of that, a commander

236
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,500
who only ever lost in battle was born.

237
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,500
And Napoleon could no longer enjoy a good meal.

238
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,800
Are you done, Mr. Lu?

239
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,300
No.

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Ning Meng, there are two kinds of people in this world.

241
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Those who are overconfident,

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
and those who know one's limitations.

243
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
Which kind are you?

244
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,600
Sorry, I'm done eating. You guys enjoy.

245
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,100
Ning Meng, don't go.

246
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,600
Don't be upset.

247
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,200
Let her go.

248
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,400
She's done eating, so she can go.

249
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
It's not good to sit with a full stomach.

250
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,100
You guys go ahead.

251
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,500
I'm going to take my leave.

252
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,400
We won't see you out.

253
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
<i>Thanks for your patronage.</i>

254
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,700
Ning Meng.

255
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,400
Sorry about that, Senior.

256
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,000
Your day was ruined.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,100
I'm fine. But are you?

258
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm fine.

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Ning Meng, don't take it to heart.

260
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
After I graduated from university, I was also looked down on a lot

261
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,900
while looking for a job in the States.

262
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
Wall Street is like the Colosseum.

263
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
It's survival of the fittest.

264
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
When I started out,

265
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,300
no one thought anything of me.

266
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,900
Nobody expected me to get to this position

267
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,000
in such a short time.

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,500
But I showed them what I was made of.

269
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
So, there's no need to care about what others think.

270
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
What matters is your own inner strength.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,900
I believe you'd be able to prove yourself, too.

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,400
Show those naysayers

273
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
and shut them up.

274
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,900
Thank you, Senior.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,600
Keep at it.

276
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,900
My car is right there.

277
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,300
I'll give you a ride.

278
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,200
It's fine.

279
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,700
I could do with some time alone.

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
All right. Take care on the way.

281
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,500
Text me when you get home.

282
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,700
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,900
What's the matter? There's so much food. Don't waste it.

284
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,600
Listen, Mr. Napoleon.

285
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
I can't believe you're still in the mood to eat.

286
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
Why not?

287
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,700
Lu Jiming.

288
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,000
Please explain to me what that show of hostility was about?

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,300
Have you no respect for others?

290
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,600
What about Ning Meng's pride?

291
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,400
That's right. You were too much.

292
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,900
Why did you ask her to pour you tea?

293
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
What's wrong with that?

294
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,800
I just asked her to pour me tea. Is anything wrong with that?

295
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Am I talking about the tea?

296
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,800
You mentioned the tea.

297
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I mentioned?

298
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Lu Jiming, only your pride matters.

299
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,300
You have your prestige, so everyone else is below you.

300
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
Prestige isn't given out freely.

301
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,600
You earn it.

302
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
Convince me otherwise if you can.

303
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Even Su Weiran couldn't refute it.

304
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
So what did I say wrongly?

305
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,500
Let's just say... You should count yourself lucky

306
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,300
that you've never been tied up and beaten to a pulp.

307
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
Beaten to death.

308
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
That would depend if they could beat me.

309
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,500
You? Dream on.

310
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,600
And you, Xu Sitian.

311
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm warning you.

312
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,950
You better not get involved with Su Weiran's proposal. Do you hear me?

313
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,400
Who are you telling me what to do?

314
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,200
I will invest. It's my money. It's my Brad Pitt.

315
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,900
- It's a no because I said so.
- What?

316
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,800
And you, Zeng Yuhang.

317
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,900
You think I don't know what dodgy things you wish to do in the virtual world?

318
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,800
What? What dodgy things?

319
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
With your level of intelligence?

320
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,300
There's a prawn head. Here's a fish head.

321
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,000
Eat them and nourish your brain.

322
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
Lu Jiming, you're unbelievable!

323
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Tiantian, wait for me.

324
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Lu Jiming, I'm so done with you.

325
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Zeng Yuhang, stop right there.

326
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Whose side are you on?

327
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm on justice's side!

328
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,500
<i>[Su Weiran: I forgot to wish you a happy holiday.]</i>

329
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,600
Waiter, the bill, please.

330
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Sir, would you like these packed?

331
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
Okay, pack them up.

332
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,500
Sure.

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Sir, the bill has been paid.

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,600
Who did?

335
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,900
The gentleman that left first.

336
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,400
All right.

337
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay.

338
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:10,334
<i>That's mean! You were just telling me</i>

339
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,700
<i>that your impression of your boss changed.</i>

340
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
An illusion. That's all it was.

341
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,800
I admit he's very capable at work.

342
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,900
But as a human being, he's the worst.

343
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,100
<i>Still, he shouldn't have behaved like that in front of your senior.</i>

344
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
That's why I couldn't stop myself.

345
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
<i>Did Su Weiran try to comfort you?</i>

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,900
By the way, Mengmeng.

347
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,000
I have a piece of good news for you.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,400
A piece of news that came from Wall Street.

349
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
Do you want to hear it?

350
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,600
<i>Wall Street? What does that have to do with me?</i>

351
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,200
Su Weiran previously worked on Wall Street, right?

352
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,900
I found out about this from a friend who's studying in the States.

353
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,200
<i>What did you do that for? Are you an informer?</i>

354
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,400
You said it yourself that he's more mature after going abroad.

355
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,000
Are you sure that's due to age

356
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,400
and not because of a woman?

357
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,300
What do you mean?

358
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,100
<i>He was dating a senior in university, right?</i>

359
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,400
<i>When you heard about it,</i>

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,300
<i>you were heartbroken for some time, no? Do you remember?</i>

361
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,700
Of course I do. How could I not?

362
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,800
<i>But not long after he went abroad,</i>

363
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
<i>the senior dumped him.</i>

364
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,000
<i>I heard it was because the senior was attracted</i>

365
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
<i>to a rich, second-generation immigrant.</i>

366
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,400
<i>Between a rich family and true love,</i>

367
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,000
<i>she picked the former.</i>

368
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Senior loved her so much though.

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,200
For her, he even gave up the chance to do his MBA at SJTU-SAIF.

370
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,300
<i>That's right. Therefore, it really was a big blow to him.</i>

371
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,600
<i>After a period of depression, it was as if he became a different person.</i>

372
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,200
<i>He never dated again after that. And he became ruthless with himself.</i>

373
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,600
<i>He became a machine.</i>

374
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,600
<i>Using only five years, he got the results and status that would take others 10 years to achieve.</i>

375
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,800
He's gone through a lot.

376
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
But thankfully, he has the capability.

377
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,800
He was a top student after all.

378
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,200
Goodness, Mengmeng.

379
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,100
How did you not get the gist of the story?

380
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,900
What I meant to say is that he's single right now.

381
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't you want to reignite the spark?

382
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
You used the wrong phrase.

383
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,500
What "reignite the spark"?

384
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,200
There was never a spark, to begin with. What is there to reignite?

385
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,300
Back then, it was my one-sided emotional investment.

386
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,400
Plus, right now,

387
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,700
we don't seem like we belong in the same world.

388
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,500
<i>Mengmeng, enough with your excuses.</i>

389
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,600
<i>What do you mean by not from the same world?</i>

390
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>All of us live on Earth.</i>

391
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,900
<i>How come you have so many worlds?</i>

392
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,200
Okay, fine.

393
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,000
It's my own choice. I decided it.

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,800
I'm hanging up. Bye-bye.

395
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to wash up.

396
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

397
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
<i>[Change]</i>

398
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,500
<i>[Change: Principles of Problem Formation and Resolution]</i>

399
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,000
Mr. Lu, your coffee. Extra strong Americano.

400
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,400
Hold on. I have a question.

401
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,300
Mr. Lu, I made the coffee correctly. Right?

402
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Am I asking the question or you?

403
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Please go ahead.

404
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,500
In the future,

405
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
if you were no longer my secretary...

406
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What did I do, Mr. Lu?

407
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Are you firing me?

408
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,600
Am I asking the question or you?

409
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,900
You... Please, go on. I won't ask.

410
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,400
If you were no longer my secretary

411
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,200
and we bumped into each other one day at a restaurant,

412
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
and I say, "Yang Xiaoyang, pour me some water," would you do it?

413
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,700
- Yes, it's just pouring water. Nothing wrong with that.
- Exactly.

414
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,400
So dramatic.

415
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,300
Wait, Mr. Lu. What do you mean by dramatic? Should I not pour?

416
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,700
No, no. I'll pour.

417
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,300
Someone from Eaglestone is coming to deliver a report today, right?

418
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,200
That's at 10:00 a.m. There are 10 more minutes.

419
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,400
Tell her to deliver it to me personally.

420
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Will do.

421
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Who are you?

422
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm an intern at Eaglestone Capital.

423
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,800
Why didn't Ning Meng come?

424
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Ms. Ning Meng said she was busy.

425
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,400
So she asked me to run the errand for her.

426
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Did you want to see her for something, Mr. Lu?

427
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
No, thank you.

428
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,700
Okay.

429
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Hello?

430
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,500
Ning Meng, are you okay?

431
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm fine.

432
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
How could you be fine?

433
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,400
Lu Jiming really went overboard.

434
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,000
After you left, Yuhang and I both sounded off on him.

435
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Gosh, no.

436
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
You guys didn't have to.

437
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
<i>Of course, we had to.</i>

438
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,600
You can't let him have his way like this.

439
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,400
That man needs to wake up from his self-entitlement.

440
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Make him realize he's wrong.

441
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,900
I don't think anyone can wake him up.

442
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,500
<i>There has to be.</i>

443
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
<i>Are you free on the weekend?</i>

444
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Well, we have to get the cleaner to discard

445
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
the trash around here.

446
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
It's quite clean.

447
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
It's not too bad. Much better than before.

448
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,200
- Let's take a photo here.
- Yes, we should.

449
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
I'll be the photographer. Come.

450
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
You go there.

451
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,000
We'll be here.

452
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,500
One, two, three. Okay.

453
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,800
- Looks good.
- Nice.

454
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,700
There are so many campervans.

455
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,300
Of course. You've got to look imposing.

456
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
This is my idea.

457
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,600
Of course, it has to be cool. Piggyback me.

458
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Why don't I take a photo for you two?

459
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
- Yes, take our photo.
- Come on.

460
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,200
One, two, three.

461
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,500
Zeng Yuhang!

462
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
I'll go and get drinks.

463
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,200
- You ladies sit.
- That's the way.

464
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
This place is nice.

465
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
Come on, Ning Meng, sit.

466
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Don't stand there.

467
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,000
How is it?

468
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,700
Isn't it different from the last one you saw?

469
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
The environment here is better.

470
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,800
And transportation is more convenient.

471
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Also, the outdoor facilities are much more complete.

472
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,600
I took a good look at the investment research you did.

473
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,000
It made a lot of sense.

474
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,300
Come sit, Mr. Zeng.

475
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,400
Here you go.

476
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,600
You've got sense.

477
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
You're thirsty, right?

478
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,200
Thanks.

479
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This is comfy.

480
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Lu Mingming just texted me.

481
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
He asked me to go to the fencing hall.

482
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
No, don't you dare reply. Ignore him.

483
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,600
That's what I was planning.

484
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
I'm still upset.

485
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll ignore him.

486
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,000
What a joke.

487
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,320
<i>[Lu Jiming: Go fencing tonight?]</i>

488
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,040
<i>[Xu Sitian: Doing what we love together.]</i>

489
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
He is our great chef.

490
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,400
- Mr. Zeng, you're good at quite a lot of things.
- This is delicious.

491
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,900
I told you. Eat more.

492
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,700
That's how he is.

493
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,800
He likes to use his limbs more than his brain.

494
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,100
The point is he doesn't have a brain.

495
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,600
Ms. Xu, are you complimenting me?

496
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
Yes, complimenting you for being brainless.

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,100
Even good food can't shut you up.

498
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,300
Here, try the chicken wings.

499
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,800
Chicken wings, my favorite!

500
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Eat it while it's hot.

501
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Let's drink. Come on.

502
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,100
- Together.
- Come on.

- He must be irritated.

Yes, he has to be.

00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,700
What should I do? Should I answer it?

Ning Meng.

512

You decide.

513
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,300
Should I pick it up? Should I? Should I?

514
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,800
I say reject it.

515
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,200
- Reject it?
- It's fine.

516
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,000
- Reject it.
- Reject!

No way.

Just answer it.

It's a rare sight.

570
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,000
I was thinking.

571
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,200
Are we being too harsh on Mingming?

572
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,600
We're not ignoring him for real.

573
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,100
We just want him to realize his own mistake.

574
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,400
We're helping him. He should be thanking us.

- Nothing wrong with it.
- That's right.

Tell me.

Do you think the RV park project will be a success?

I'm being serious. Don't give me a cursory answer.

Tiantian, the thing is,

581
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,400
you do suck at a lot of things.

582
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,200
But your never-give-up attitude is indeed adorable.

583
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,300
I mean, this RV park project you've persisted on.

584
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,000
You've been working hard on it.

585
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,900
You're slowly starting to listen to other people's opinions.

586
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,900
I think that is a big change for you.

587
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't you know?

588
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,800
You're doing good.

589
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,400
Just keep at it.

590
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,000
Why is it so cold?

591
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll add more firewood.

592
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,900
Wait a bit. I'll make the fire bigger.

Wear this.

595
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,900
You gave me your jacket. Aren't you cold?

596
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,800
No.

597
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
How can you not be cold?

598
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
Come here, we'll squeeze.

599
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,000
We can share the jacket.

600
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This way, we won't be cold.

601
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,400
Isn't this better?

602
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,500
Yeah, it's not as cold.

603
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,525
How did you get in?

604
00:34:16,525 --> 00:34:20,194
With your stupid password that hasn't been changed ever?

605
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:21,934
Still, you didn't have to creep up on me like that.

606
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,654
What if I got a shock?

607
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:26,035
You? Get a shock?

608
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:30,155
- Zeng Yuhang, I noticed you're becoming brazen.
- What?

609
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,235
You guys dared to reject my calls.

610
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:33,715
Ning Meng, too.

611
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:36,405
Did you guys egg her into doing it?

612
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,724
Do you think Ning Meng needed persuading?

613
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:40,925
After the way you treated her that day,

614
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:43,554
you should be thankful she hasn't blocked you.

615
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,755
How did I treat her?

616
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:47,765
What did I do wrong?

617
00:34:49,485 --> 00:34:51,895
Did I really do something wrong?

618
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:58,545
Okay. Let's have you inverse your second question.

619
00:34:58,545 --> 00:35:00,425
Inverse?

620
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:04,584
What did I not do wrong?

621
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:07,155
Every bit you did was wrong.

622
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:11,255
Just lay it all out. Go on.

623
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:16,965
Sure. Since you wish to die, I'll help bury you.

624
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,125
Lu Jiming.

625
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:25,724
Ning Meng worked as your secretary for three years with the utmost professionalism.

626
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,295
She was good at it.

627
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:29,185
At least, give her due credit.

628
00:35:29,185 --> 00:35:30,635
I never denied it.

629
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:32,315
I said it at the dinner table.

630
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:33,965
She was a great secretary.

631
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,355
Is that how you praise someone?

632
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:38,915
Who would take that as a compliment?

633
00:35:38,915 --> 00:35:42,474
Moreover, it's been some time since Ning Meng joined Eaglestone.

634
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:46,044
Who was it that praised her for writing a good proposal?

635
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,004
Why can't you be the bigger person?

636
00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:50,884
Sincerely give her your blessing. Is that so hard?

637
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,765
You're just so petty.

638
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:57,504
Also, it's okay to ask Ning Meng to pour you tea.

639
00:35:57,504 --> 00:35:59,924
But there's a place for that.

640
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,244
How could you put her in that spot in front of her senior?

641
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,425
You even took a jab at her wanting to be an investor.

642
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:07,044
How did you expect Ning Meng to react?

643
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,164
Don't explode just yet. Let me finish.

644
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:10,724
It's not just towards Ning Meng.

645
00:36:10,724 --> 00:36:12,685
You treat everyone this way.

646
00:36:12,685 --> 00:36:14,554
If you're happy, you say something nice.

647
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:16,684
If you're unhappy, you blast everyone and everything.

648
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:19,455
Even if it was your father, you'd lambaste him too.

649
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:21,365
Are you finished?

650
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:25,015
Listen! Don't you sound off at me.

651
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:27,765
I'm done. You can speak your mind now.

652
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:33,545
I guess that's somewhat of a reason.

653
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:36,975
That day, at dinner,

654
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:39,485
I did go a little overboard.

655
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,765
You went too far.

656
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:48,825
I think you owe Ning Meng an apology.

657
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,005
Apology?

658
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:56,024
We've heard your investment plan.

659
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:58,034
We'll get in touch if there are any suitable projects.

660
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,885
You don't have to see me off.

661
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,245
Okay, thanks for coming.

662
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:02,155
Sure. Goodbye.

663
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:03,655
Bye.

664
00:37:14,055 --> 00:37:15,755
Ning Meng?

665
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,045
Senior.

666
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:20,005
What are you doing here?

667
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:23,004
My company is upstairs. I work here.

668
00:37:23,004 --> 00:37:24,104
What a coincidence.

669
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:26,654
I'm here to find out more about an AR glasses startup.

670
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:28,995
They're on this block, too.

671
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:33,605
AR? Is it the one you mentioned at the dinner?

672
00:37:33,605 --> 00:37:35,225
Yes.

673
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:39,305
Are you in a better mood now?

674
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,105
Mr. Lu, he...

675
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:47,245
Oh, it was nothing. Sorry, you had to see it.

676
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,115
Good to know.

677
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:53,824
Anyway, the investee said they're giving me a few glasses to try out.

678
00:37:53,824 --> 00:37:57,504
When you're done with work, would you like to test them, too?

679
00:37:57,504 --> 00:38:00,094
You probably couldn't fully comprehend by words alone.

680
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:03,154
I'd like you to try it for yourself, the magic of those glasses.

681
00:38:03,154 --> 00:38:05,725
And get your thoughts in the meantime.

682
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:07,395
Okay.

683
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,945
This is their prototype.

684
00:38:13,945 --> 00:38:17,314
They installed a chip, battery, gyroscope,

685
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:20,825
and camera on the temples.

686
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:24,405
I thought it'd be similar to a helmet. But it's just like a pair of glasses.

687
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:26,934
They designed the blueprint of the glasses themselves.

688
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:30,634
By reducing the chip's power consumption, they could use a smaller battery.

689
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:33,155
The power button is here.

690
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:34,804
Here? Try it.

691
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:36,894
Okay. Let's go.

692
00:38:45,512 --> 00:38:48,300
<i>[Lacerta, Pegasus]</i>

693
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,145
It's so beautiful.

694
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:57,055
Nowadays, light pollution in the city is bad.

695
00:38:57,055 --> 00:38:59,535
We can hardly see the stars in the sky.

696
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:03,435
The designer of these glasses added a star map feature.

697
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:06,985
Try and find the Polaris.

698
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:09,275
Northern Star?

699
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:11,924
It's this way.

700
00:39:11,924 --> 00:39:13,625
There.

701
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,115
Yes, I see it!

702
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,204
There's also Ursa Major and Ursa Minor!

703
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,495
<i>[Ursa Minor]</i>
It's so cute!

704
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:21,795
<i>[Ursa Major]</i>

705
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:23,724
Can I see my own zodiac?

706
00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:24,764
What's your zodiac?

707
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:25,875
Gemini.

708
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,795
Gemini? I remember it is...

709
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:32,484
in the east of Taurus, west of Cancer.

710
00:39:32,484 --> 00:39:33,985
Over there!

711
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:40,500
<i>[Gemini]</i>

712
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,875
So that's what it looks like.

713
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,675
This is so interesting.

714
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,255
Senior, what about your zodiac?

715
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:49,864
My zodiac is the biggest one among the 12 constellations.

716
00:39:49,864 --> 00:39:53,445
Its main star is spread across the Milky Way.

717
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:56,255
It's Scorpio.

718
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,025
<i>[Scorpio]</i>

719
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,415
Isn't it incredible?

720
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:12,874
Very.

721
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:14,354
Let's look for other constellations.

722
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,755
Okay.

723
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:17,584
Which constellation is that?

724
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:19,085
- Libra.
- Libra?

725
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:20,024
Yes.

726
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:21,865
And this one...

727
00:40:21,865 --> 00:40:22,614
What is it? Virgo.

728
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:23,975
Yes. It's Virgo.

729
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:24,975
There's Cancer.

730
00:40:24,975 --> 00:40:25,995
Cancer.

731
00:40:25,995 --> 00:40:26,925
Can...

732
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,144
Leo.

733
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:29,845
That's Leo.

734
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:42,764
Senior, that pair of glasses was pretty intriguing.

735
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:45,035
Will you invest in the company?

736
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:46,905
We still have to do more research.

737
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:50,584
But in a nutshell, such new technology is indeed captivating.

738
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:55,584
It's really like a science fiction movie that's come to life.

739
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:57,815
I thought about it.

740
00:40:57,815 --> 00:41:00,744
This sort of augmented reality based on the real world

741
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:05,044
should have more practical applications when compared to made-up virtual reality.

742
00:41:05,044 --> 00:41:07,484
If and when the apparatus is refined,

743
00:41:07,484 --> 00:41:10,146
could it be that we can leave our phones at home?

744
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:11,645
You're right.

745
00:41:11,645 --> 00:41:15,894
In the future, human and computer interaction will just be like human-to-human interaction.

746
00:41:15,894 --> 00:41:17,794
There won't be a need for keyboards or screens.

747
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:20,445
We will be using sight, motion, and voice to give commands.

748
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,654
Augmented reality will make such interactions possible.

749
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:29,065
Ning Meng, I told you, you have what it takes to manage a project.

750
00:41:29,065 --> 00:41:32,935
The way your eyes light up when you talk about a product is very precious.

751
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,844
Are you really interested in becoming an investor?

752
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:38,775
Yes.

753
00:41:38,775 --> 00:41:41,215
I think the best thing about being an investor

754
00:41:41,215 --> 00:41:46,134
is when something you've worked hard on receives everyone's approval.

755
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:49,114
To let them see the real value of the product.

756
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:52,585
I worked on a thermos cup project once.

757
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:56,344
But halfway through, the project was taken from me.

758
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:58,835
It left me feeling defeated for some time.

759
00:41:58,835 --> 00:42:01,320
Later, when the product was released,

760
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,161
I noticed that a lot of my ideas were used.

761
00:42:03,161 --> 00:42:05,021
And the sales were very good.

762
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:07,151
That made me happy.

763
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:08,611
Believe in yourself.

764
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:11,201
You will surely become a good investor.

765
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,501
Thanks, Senior.
