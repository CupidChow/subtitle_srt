I asked the receptionist. There was nothing.

That's weird. Then why did he say that he sent it yesterday

You split up the tasks time and again.

98

What right do you have to say that?

101
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,000
Since you are in charge of this project,

102
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,960
isn't this your job?

103

Why should I promise you?

148
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,900
I am the special assistant to the board chairman.

149

I have many issues to solve every single day.

Of course.

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,700
Neither, I'm just stating the facts.

164
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
I know Mr. Fang is usually busy with work.

165
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,900
I understand that you are unable to respond to messages in a timely manner.

166
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,700
However, it took you a whole day to reply

167
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,400
to a message I sent to you in the morning.

168
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,000
You promised to send me the documents the next day,

169
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,700
but you always delayed it for three or four days.

170
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,500
Do you think this is reasonable?

171
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,200
I recall that Yuanyuan Real Estate

172
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,600
has no new projects this year.

173
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,500
Are you really that busy?

174
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,200
Ning, this information is all trade secrets.

175
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,200
You do not need to know them.

176
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,400
We are now passing through the risk control stage.

177
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
If you can't even pass the risk control,

178
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,600
it's better to not do this private placement project.

179
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
No, do I need you to teach me how to do these?

180
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
You want the… what was it?

181
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
The Self-Financing Undertaking Letter, right?

182
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,300
Just wait.

183
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

184
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,200
Hello, Ms. Shi.

185
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,100
<i>Ning Meng, come back to the office.</i>

186
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,300
I'm delivering some documents to Mr. Lu now. I'll come back after the delivery.

187
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>Come back first, I have something to tell you.</i>

188
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,900
All right.

189
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
Ms. Shi.

190
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,900
Come in.

191
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,200
This is what you put together a few days ago, right?

192
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Due diligence questionnaire?

193
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,800
Didn't I already send it to the Asset Management and the Trust epartment to be verified?

194
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
It was rejected.

195
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Why?

196
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
Take a look at what's missing.

197
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
I forgot to get them stamped.

198
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,600
A copy without an official seal

199
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
has no legal effect at all.

200
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,400
This is the most basic common sense of every company.

201
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm sorry. I'll get them stamped right away.

202
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,700
No. The new one is on the way.

203
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,300
Ning Meng, have a seat.

204
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Ning Meng, you have been a secretary for three years.

205
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
You must have this common sense.

206
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,600
You are not usually a careless girl.

207
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,400
How can you make these newbie mistakes?

208
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,700
It's my fault. I was careless.

209
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,900
It won't happen again.

210
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,600
Actually, this project is not easy at all.

211
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,800
Fang Jian is misusing his position.

212
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
He thinks your level is too low,

213
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,000
so he doesn't want to deal with you and deliberately delays your time.

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Mr. Lu requested the documents one by one,

215
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
making you feel like a ball

216
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,000
being kicked back and forth. Right?

217
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,500
Do you feel that Mr. Lu is deliberately making it hard for you?

218
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,000
I've been in the workplace for so many years,

219
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,900
I think I am all right at evaluating people.

220
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,000
Mr. Lu is young and has a personality.

221
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Sometimes, he likes to follow his temper.

222
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,100
However, he's definitely not one

223
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,200
who would muddle work with private affairs.

224
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,300
I've asked around.

225
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,600
In fact, it was the Trust and Asset Management Departments

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
that requested the documents one by one.

227
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
It had nothing to do with Mr. Lu.

228
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,000
You've misunderstood Mr. Lu.

229
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,800
So in this whole process,

230
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,800
who was the one being swayed by emotions?

231
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Ms. Shi,

232
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,000
it was my fault.

233
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
I shouldn't bring my emotions to work,

234
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
affecting my basic judgment.

235
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
It's okay if you make a mistake.

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,200
The most important thing is to learn your lesson

237
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,300
after every mistake.

238
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,200
I told you so much

239
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,400
because I have high expectations of you.

240
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,500
I used to be a clerk, too.

241
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,800
If someone was willing to guide me back then,

242
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,700
I would definitely be more than what I am today.

243
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,600
When I see you,

244
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,200
I remember myself in the past.

245
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I hope you can grow

246
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,200
in the shortest time possible.

247
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
Little Ning Meng growing into big Ning Meng.

248
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Don't let me down.

249
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Stop there.

250
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,500
Your stilts betrayed you. Do you know?

251
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,400
Mr. Lu.

252
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,800
Sorry.

253
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,700
What did you do to offend me?

254
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
Say it clearly.

255
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,500
Did your boss scold you?

256
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,600
No.

257
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
She'll only be your boss temporarily.

258
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Do not take it personally.

259
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,300
You are just starting.

260
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Who wouldn't make a mistake?

261
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Okay, I'll talk to Ms. Shi.

262
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,400
Mr. Lu.

263
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,900
<i>Hello, neighbor. It's me, sorry to trouble you.</i>

264
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,900
<i>Can you come help get Lu Jiming?</i>

265
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,300
<i>Well, we met some new friends tonight.</i>

266
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,600
<i>He drank too much.</i>

267
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,000
<i>I have matters to attend to, I need to leave first.</i>

268
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,400
- But…
<i>- Lu Mingming, be careful! Don't you fall!</i>

269
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,000
<i>It's okay if it's inconvenient for you.</i>

270
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
<i>I'll think of another way, goodbye.</i>

271
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
<i>Wake up, stop drinking!</i>

272
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
<i>Stop drinking!</i>

273
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,800
Wait a minute.

274
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Send me the address.

275
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>Ning Meng, you are a loyal friend! Thank you.</i>

276
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Bye.

277
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,000
You just came back from abroad.

278
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,700
I have a feeling that we met each other too late.

279
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,800
- Let's meet again.
- Sure.

280
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,300
- See you again.
- See you.

281
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,200
- One last drink, okay?
- No, I can still drink.

282
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,100
No, stop drinking.

283
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Ning Meng, come.

284
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Here, Mr. Li.

285
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
<i>Senior.</i>

286
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,100
<i>What's up, Su?</i>

287
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,000
<i>Nothing.</i>

288
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,400
<i>Thank you, Senior.</i>

289
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,100
<i>You are awesome.</i>

290
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,400
<i>The last question is an add-on.</i>

291
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
<i>Very few could answer it.</i>

292
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,200
<i>Check it, is it done?</i>

293
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

294
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,600
<i>[Hope your future is as bright as the star]</i>

295
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,200
<i>Won't this be too sudden?</i>

296
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
<i>Why would it be?</i>

297
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,600
<i>Trust me. Surprise is the beginning of a romance.</i>

298
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,700
<i>I'm afraid… I'm afraid this would be a fright instead of a surprise.</i>

299
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,200
<i>That's not what you said in the dorm.</i>

300
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
<i>Su Weiran's voice is so nice.</i>

301
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
<i>He's so hot.</i>

302
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,300
<i>I want to prepare a birthday present for him.</i>

303
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,400
<i>That's what you said.</i>

304
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
<i>Are you trying to back out now?</i>

305
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>Hurry up.</i>

306
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
<i>I'm a little nervous.</i>

307
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,600
<i>Good luck. Trust me.</i>

308
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
<i>- Come on!
- Come on!</i>

309
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,200
<i>Senior.</i>

310
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,800
<i>Hello.</i>

311
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
<i>I want to give you a present.</i>

312
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,300
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

313
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,000
<i>Thank you for last time.</i>

314
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,500
<i>Thank you, too.</i>

315
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,600
<i>Then I'll go first, bye.</i>

316
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
<i>Mengmeng, you are really...</i>

317
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,400
<i>Awesome!</i>

318
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,600
<i>- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.</i>

319
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,000
<i>Don't you want to see his face when he opens the present?</i>

320
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,700
<i>Take a look.</i>

321
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,200
Sour Orange, why are you standing there?

322
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
Come here.

323
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,100
Come here!

324
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,400
Come on, let me introduce them to you.

325
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,000
Mr. Li. Mr. Su.

326
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
Two excellent investors.

327
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,400
Hello.

328
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,100
Mr. Lu is too honest.

329
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,200
No one is forcing him to drink, but he himself drank too much.

330
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,800
Mr. Lu is such a man of passion. Let's go.

331
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,200
- Let's go back.
- Send him back.

332
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,100
Come on, get up.

333
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,900
- Ning Meng, pay the bill.
- Okay.

334
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,400
It's okay, no problem. Forget it.

335
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,500
No, I'll pay.

336
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,700
Slow down, be careful.

337
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,600
- Are you all right?
- Be careful.

338
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,800
Do you want my help?

339
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,400
Yes, thank you.

340
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Let me do it.

341
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,900
I don't feel so good.

342
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,700
Be careful.

343
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
Slowly.

344
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,800
Slowly.

345
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,100
Don't puke.

346
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,200
I want to drink some more.

347
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,500
No, Mr. Lu.

348
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,100
Mr. Lu.

349
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,200
Take it slow. Going down steps.

350
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,400
- Be careful.
- Take it slow.

351
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
What?

352
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
Slow down.

353
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,800
My efforts are wasted.

354
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,600
- Is it this one?
- Yes.

355
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,900
You have everything practiced in vain, Ning Meng.

356
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Let me tell you, Mr. Su.

357
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,200
Mr. Su. Sour Orange.

358
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,300
From today onwards, you two are my guardians.

359
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,100
All right! Go in, quick.

360
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,600
- Don't push me.
- Go in.

361
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
Go in.

362
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
Thank you so much.

363
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
No problem.

364
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Let's go.

365
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Come on, Mr. Su, get in the car.

366
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,500
Come to my house and drink some more.

367
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,100
That's enough.

368
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm sorry.

369
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,300
It's all right.

370
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,800
It's rough for you alone, right?

371
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Should I tag along?

372
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,300
Much appreciated.

373
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,000
Get in the car.

374
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,900
Would you mind if I open the window?

375
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,300
Sure. No problem.

376
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,800
Sorry to trouble you. We're almost there.

377
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
It's fine.

378
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
Is Mr. Lu always so humorous after drinking?

379
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,400
I wish he wasn't so funny.

380
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Sit here for a while.

381
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,700
Be careful.

382
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,000
Change my shoes.

383
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
Shoes.

384
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,200
Let's go.

385
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
- Come on.
- No.

386
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Let Ning Meng help me.

387
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,100
I'm sorry, he doesn't like others to…

388
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,000
I understand.

389
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,200
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

390
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's go. What are you doing? Hurry up.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,800
Come on, let's go in.

392
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,200
- Come on.
- See you.

393
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Do you even lift?

394
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Slow down.

395
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:19,567
<i>[Locke]</i>

396
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:55,075
You haven't left?

397
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,935
Have you settled him down?

398
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:01,465
Thank you for today.

399
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:07,525
You are my junior,

400
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:10,215
why are you so polite to me?

401
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:15,395
I thought you wouldn't remember me, Senior.

402
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:17,295
How could I forget?

403
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:30,505
When did you recognize me?

404
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:33,675
At the first glance.

405
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:37,755
But I didn't know if I should reveal it.

406
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,545
After all, you seemed to be treating me as if I were a stranger.

407
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,745
I thought you had forgotten me.

408
00:34:49,575 --> 00:34:51,105
You are Mr. Lu's…

409
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:52,885
Former secretary.

410
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:56,325
I'm just a volunteer helper today.

411
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,685
You really changed a lot.

412
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:01,725
I remember when we were in school,

413
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,725
you were wearing black-rimmed glasses

414
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:05,505
and were quiet and reserved.

415
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:10,315
Well, your looks now suit you a lot.

416
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:13,295
Thanks.

417
00:35:15,735 --> 00:35:18,895
I remember you went abroad after you got your Master's degree.

418
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:20,715
When did you come back?

419
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:23,375
Not long ago, I just returned to Shanghai a few months ago.

420
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:26,035
What are you doing now?

421
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:29,515
I work for an investment firm. Eaglestone Capital.

422
00:35:29,515 --> 00:35:31,635
Then we are in the same field of work.

423
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:34,215
I was in investment banking a few years back when I was on Wall Street.

424
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,305
Then jumped ship to BDI in Silicon Valley.

425
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,765
The multinational venture capital firm? They're super famous!

426
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:43,405
They helped many companies get listed on Nasdaq.

427
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:48,595
But right now, the global trade and talent center is gradually shifting to China.

428
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:51,715
The listed volume of China's start-up companies has far surpassed the United States.

429
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,695
BDI is also vigorously developing its business in China.

430
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:58,995
That's why they sent me to the Shanghai branch as an executive director.

431
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:02,115
Since we are all in the same circle now,

432
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:05,545
we might have a chance to collaborate.

433
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:07,525
You are amazing.

434
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:11,365
You might need to wait two more years if we are to collaborate.

435
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,495
Were you discussing work with Mr. Lu today?

436
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,015
No.

437
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:19,515
It was a private meeting.

438
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,855
It was my first time meeting Mr. Lu.

439
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:23,835
The first time?

440
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:26,195
And he got himself drunk.

441
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,075
Yeah.

442
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,265
I wanted to have a talk with him.

443
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,705
I didn't know he couldn't hold his liquor.

444
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:36,375
But he's really young.

445
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,945
In China, becoming a successful investor

446
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:41,165
with his achievements at his age is rare.

447
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:46,285
I heard that he inherited his father's business?

448
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:49,305
But he founded the company without spending a penny from his father.

449
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:53,105
Joint Capital is completely built by him.

450
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:57,605
By the way, his company has also won the New Forces Award this year.

451
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:01,665
That means your boss is awesome.

452
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:04,315
He's my former boss.

453
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:07,735
I'm just stating the facts.

454
00:37:08,545 --> 00:37:10,005
Well, you are awesome too.

455
00:37:10,005 --> 00:37:12,235
I remember that exam.

456
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:16,005
You seemed to be the only one that got the extra question right.

457
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:19,985
I have you to thank for helping me out that time.

458
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:22,845
You have thanked me many times.

459
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,025
You're welcome.

460
00:38:01,564 --> 00:38:04,950
<i>[To You Qi: I met Su Weiran today.]</i>

461
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:19,365
<i>Su Weiran?</i>

462
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:22,205
<i>Oh my god. Did you actually meet Su Weiran?</i>

463
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:23,805
Yes.

464
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:27,875
<i>Why are you so calm? Even I'm more excited than you.</i>

465
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,095
<i>It was you who had a crush on him back then, not me.</i>

466
00:38:30,095 --> 00:38:31,955
I was excited.

467
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:34,105
It was all in my heart.

468
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:37,795
Besides, I'm no longer the little girl back then.

469
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,485
<i>Is he still as handsome? He didn't turn bald or anything, right?</i>

470
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,675
You might be disappointed.

471
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:45,335
Not only is he more handsome,

472
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:48,435
and after going through

473
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:53,325
some life experience, he is more mature and elegant.

474
00:38:53,325 --> 00:38:55,565
<i>Is he still single?</i>

475
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,535
Probably not married yet.

476
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,645
He doesn't have a ring on his finger.

477
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:02,015
I don't know if he's still single or not, though.

478
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,095
<i>Have you gotten his WeChat, then?</i>

479
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:07,145
<i>Did you guys talk about meeting up again?</i>

480
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,895
As if.

481
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:12,845
But maybe he's just being polite.

482
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:15,205
<i>Mengmeng, you have to be more confident.</i>

483
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:17,595
<i>There could be a chance, right?</i>

484
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:21,875
<i>You can't let happiness slip through your fingers.</i>

485
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:27,005
<i>I have to go now. I'm going to get some beauty sleep.</i>

486
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:28,985
Go.

487
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:52,265
<i>[Seligman, Western United States]</i>

488
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:17,785
Mr. Lu, I have the materials ready. I'm delivering them now.

489
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:19,105
<i>No need.</i>

490
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,045
Why is that?

491
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,225
Yuanyuan Real Estate cannot participate in this project.

492
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:26,385
Why can't Yuanyuan participate?

493
00:41:26,385 --> 00:41:30,325
Why? Why do you have so many questions?

494
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:32,075
Have you ever been to their company?

495
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,205
Yes. Twice.

496
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:36,305
Did you notice anything?

497
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:40,715
<i>[Notice of Outstanding Debt]
Who are you looking for?</i>

498
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,845
<i>Hello, is Mr. Fang here?</i>

499
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,475
<i>How was your interview last time?</i>

500
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:47,295
<i>It's so hard to find a job now.</i>

501
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:50,945
They don't have a new project this year.

502
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:53,275
Do they have financial issues?

503
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,115
Did they falsify their financial statements?

504
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:57,975
They don't have the guts to falsify statements.

505
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,805
But there must be something fishy about it.

506
00:42:01,735 --> 00:42:03,915
Mr. Lu, hold on for a moment.

507
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:14,395
Yuanyuan Real Estate's liquid assets look okay.

508
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:16,695
No problem at all?

509
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:22,595
Then it's a matter of other liquid assets?

510
00:42:22,595 --> 00:42:25,425
Every company has its own accounting habits.

511
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,475
This is not against the rules of accounting.

512
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:31,165
If there's something fishy, it will be hidden here.

513
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,455
You know your theoretical knowledge.

514
00:42:34,455 --> 00:42:36,925
<i>[Trading Assets]</i>

515
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:41,025
They factored receivables into other liquidity.

516
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,005
Receivables like this

517
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:45,165
<i>[Category disclosure by bad debt provision]</i>
need to take bad debt provision into account.

518
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,395
<i>Yuanyuan did include it,</i>

519
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:53,195
but this ratio is way too low.

520
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,225
<i>[Bad Debt Provision Ratio: 0.4%]</i>

521
00:42:55,225 --> 00:43:00,405
Also, this Tianyuan New City construction project seemed to have an agreement dispute.

522
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:01,485
Let me check it out.

523
00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:03,735
Okay, take your time.

524
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:14,155
Only 40 million yuan?

525
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:18,605
Mr. Lu, what's wrong with you? Are you all right?

526
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:21,455
What could happen to me? Continue.

527
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,195
<i>I'm done.</i>

528
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:25,695
The amount of capital increase is 70 million yuan.

529
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:28,175
This is too much of a difference.

530
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:30,005
How are they going to make up for that 30 million yuan?

531
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,355
They can't even give us an answer.

532
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:37,995
Mr. Lu, you mean…?

533
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:40,075
<i>I said everything I had to say.</i>

534
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:43,535
Cut them off and get a different limited partner.
