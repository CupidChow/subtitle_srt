What are you doing here?

7
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,670
What about you?

8

Why were you here?

9
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,040
Joint Capital has been dissolved.

10
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,730
So I came to see how Mr. Lu was doing.

11

Is that all?

12
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,240
You got it wrong.

13
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,500
- Mr. Lu was...
- Did I get it wrong?

I apologize.

17
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,850
I won't do it again next time.

18
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,190
You want there to be a next time?

19
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,550
We'll talk after you've calmed down.

20
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,810
Don't leave. Make yourself clear.

21
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,170
What do you want me to say?

22
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,380
I worked at Joint Capital for three years.

23
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,390
Now the company is gone

24
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,650
and everyone is heartbroken!

25
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,340
Do you have to pick a fight with me today?

26
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,950

27
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,900
Why are you always there for him whenever something happens to him?

28
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,020
You just can't forget him, can you?

29
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,330
Why do you cherish this lousy toy?

30

Yet, you are still denying that you have feelings for him.

31

32

33

But you're all the same.

34
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,130
You guys like two-timing.

35
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,610
Be honest with me.

36
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,350
When did you start seeing him?

37
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,400

- Are you here to pick Ning Meng up?
- Ms. Shi.

57

Do you know I divorced twice?

66
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,520
In the beginning, everything was perfect.

67
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,200
I was willing to stick to my choice.

68
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,680
Even if there were some red flags,

69
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,980
I would tell myself to keep persisting.

70
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,940
If I didn't persist,

71
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,400
I'd be disappointed in my choice.

72
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,610
Even you would think that way?

73
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,850
Of course. I was young too, you know?

74
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,370
I've been through a lot, too.

75
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,780
In life, we keep making choices.

76
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,240
But no one will always make the right choices.

77
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,700
What should we do if we make the wrong choice?

78
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,180
Just change it if it was the wrong choice.

79
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,860
But...

80
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,120
Ning Meng, I know you're not someone

81
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,140
who would give up easily.

82
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,580
Let me ask you this, then.

83
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,760
Did you stand up for the projects because they were worth it,

84
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,540
or was it because the persistence itself was worth it?

85
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,660
Of course, the projects were worth it.

86
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
It's the same with love.

87
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,450
Whether you're happy or forcing yourself,

88
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,030
these feelings matter most.

89
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,450
I just feel...

90
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,440
so exhausted.

91
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,790
The truth is, I used to think...

92
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,710
if there was such a thing as persistence in love.

93
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,300

95
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,420
Why did you want to meet me here?

96
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,350
But it's a pretty good place.

97
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,640
The weather today is nice, too.

98
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,110
Do you want to drink anything? I'll buy it for you.

99

No need.

100
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,620
Are you still angry?

101
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,340
I know I was wrong that night.

102
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,520
I couldn't control myself.

103
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,000
Please believe me.

104
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,830
I won't lose control again next time.

105
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,180
Senior...

106
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,760
let's break up.

107
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,830
Ning Meng, don't say things out of spite.

108
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,470
If it was because of that night,

109
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,480
- I promise that I...
- You don't have to.

110
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,440
You don't trust me.

111
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,450
And now I can no longer trust you.

112
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not the only one who was in a vicious circle.

113
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,890
You were in one, too. Am I right?

114
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,190
You had no way to get out of your past trauma.

115
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,030
So you can't help but mistrust someone.

116
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,130
I know you did your best.

117
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,300
So did I.

118
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,450
Perhaps we started dating at the wrong time.

119
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,230
We're no longer the people we used to be at university.

120
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,750
Under our current circumstances,

121
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,170
we'll only hurt each other

122
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,120
if we stay together.

123
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,640
So it's better to break up.

124
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,150
Is it useless...

125
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,880

00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,900
He'd stay there all night.

170
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,710
Sometimes, I would tell him to rest early.

171
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,570
But he kept saying he was not tired...

172
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,390
That it wasn't...

173
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,110
That it wasn't time for him to step down.

174
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,430
He just left like this.

175
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,730
This stubborn old man was too mean.

176
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,160
How could he just leave us...

177
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,190
without saying anything?

What's wrong? You look distracted.

190
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,210
Sometimes I feel it'd have been better if I were more perceptive.

191
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,420
How perceptive do you want to be?

192
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,340
You're perceptive enough.

193
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,690
Weren't you the one who brought in Mobi and Lehui's projects?

194
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,780
I heard Mobi will be listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations.

195
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,610
Look at Lehui. Have you seen their data report?

196
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,920
Ms. Shi was so happy about it.

197
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,800
Ning Meng, what's wrong?

198
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,590
Is something troubling you?

199
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,930
Maybe I have been too exhausted recently.

200
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,420
We're going to have some days off for Mid-Autumn Festival.

201
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,950
Do you have any plans?

202
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,470
I might go home.

203
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,960
I haven't seen my parents for a while now.

204
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,140
You usually work too hard.

205
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,400
Since you have time, you should spend time with your parents.

206
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,410
Your phone is ringing.

207
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,950
Yes, Mr. Zeng.

208
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,070
<i>Hey, Ning Meng. Is Lu Jiming with you?</i>

209
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,260
No.

210
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,080
What's wrong?

211
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,150
He's missing. We've been searching everywhere for him.

212
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,950
<i>The number you've dialed is switched off.</i>

213
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,010
Mr. Zeng, his phone is switched off.

214
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,130
What? It's off?

215
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,820
No one answered just now. Why did he switch it off now?

216
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,720
What exactly happened?

217
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>He hasn't been doing very well lately.</i>

218
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,770
He's especially depressed.

219
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,460
I thought he'd come around after several days.

220
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,540
But when I woke up this morning, he was missing.

221
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,700
He's not answering his calls either.

222
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,850
Tiantian and I have been searching. But we still can't find him.

223
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,420
He won't do anything stupid, will he?

224
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,640
You... Don't panic.

225
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,330
Let's think of the places he might go.

226
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,850
We've already searched the places he'd go,

227
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,210
but he was nowhere to be found.

228
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:47,230
<i>Ning Meng, can you think of any other places he might be?</i>

229
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,680
All right. Let's keep in touch.

230
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,430
Sir, please turn the car around.

231
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,470
Mr. Zeng, I found him.

232
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,210
I'll send the location to you.

233
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,920
Mr. Lu,

234
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,310
why didn't you answer your phone?

235
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,190
It's out of battery.

236
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,350
In the past, I always saw my dad catch huge fish.

237
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,090
I never thought he was impressive at all.

238
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
Now that I'm giving it a go,

239
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,060
it's pretty hard.

240
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,070
When I was little, he'd take me fishing every weekend.

241
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,120
I found it so annoying.

242
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,690
When we reached home at night,

243
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,830
we had to eat the fish he had caught.

244
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,950
It was not tasty at all.

245
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,900
I can no longer eat it even if I want it now.

246
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,650
I said the meanest thing to my dad...

247
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,950
when my mom had just passed away.

248
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,050
I fought with my dad.

249
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,760
I was so upset...

250
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,280
that I said...

251
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,110
he didn't deserve to be my dad.

252
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,400
Even if he died, I wouldn't cry.

253
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,690
You must take care of yourself.

254
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,230
Otherwise, your dad won't go in peace.

255
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,830
Ning Meng, you were right when you scolded me.

256
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,700
Not only am I bad-tempered,

257
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,980
but I also don't say what I mean and am presumptuous.

258
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,470
But I learned these too late.

259
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,630
Lu Jiming, you've gone too far!

260
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,750
Are you trying to scare us to death?

261
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,730
Wait for me.

262
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,290
How could you just vanish like that?

263
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,160
Keep it down.

264
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,620
Can you not disappear like this?

265
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,420
We thought you were doing something stupid.

266
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,410
Don't worry.

267
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,380
I have a huge debt to pay.

268
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,070
I'm not that irresponsible.

269
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,640
You're not the only one fighting this.

270
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,150
You still have us.

271
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,540
You can't abandon us.

272
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,940
You're done fishing?

273
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,280
How can I fish?

274
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,060
You scared away the fish.

275
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,940
Time to pack up.

276
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,290
You were the one who scared us.

277
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,830
The Mid-Autumn Festival is around the corner.

278
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,480
Why don't you join Tiantian and me abroad for a few days?

279
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,740
I've bought the tickets.

280
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,460
I'm not going.

281
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,800
You didn't even ask where we were going.

282
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,050
If you're not going, we're not going either.

283
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,100
Let's get out of Shanghai.

284
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,220
It's nice to go out and relax our minds. Right?

285
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,730
Why not let him come with me?

286
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,370
I'm going home this Mid-Autumn Festival.

287
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,750
If he comes with me, you don't have to change your plans anymore.

288
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,070
Go back to your home?

289
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,060
Is that okay?

290
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,220
It smells so good.

291
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,150
Try it.

292
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,390
Not bad. It's tasty.

293
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,860
It looks like I'm not dumb at all.

294
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,720
Of course, you're smart.

295
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Are you sure you're not going home with us?

296
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,530
No.

297
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,740
It's not like I've never been to your home.

298
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,300
But I'm worried about leaving you here alone.

299
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,570
I have already learned how to cook so I won't starve.

300
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,720
Moreover, I have plans.

301
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,890
What plans?

302
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,170
I'm planning to find a job

303
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,210
and send out my resume.

304
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,350
Really?

305
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,560
Didn't you say I've been resting for too long?

306
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,020
It's time for me to find a job.

307
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,920
I can't just sit idly at home.

308
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,620
So you can go home with your ex-boss without any worries.

309
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,990
He's having a harder time than me.

310
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,750
Okay.

311
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,800
Beautiful, right?

312
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,420
My hometown is famous for having lots of rivers, bridges, and wine.

313
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,220
Our wine is made from glutinous rice.

314
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,760
Glutinous rice can be made into sweet rice wine.

315
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,220
- Come.
- I...

316
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,870
I'll help you carry them.

317
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,070
- Thanks.
- This one, too.

318
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,830
It's okay. I can do this myself.

319
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,680
I can just do this.

320
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,920
Glutinous rice can be made into sweet rice wine.

321
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,570
It's really good. I was drunk from drinking it when I was a kid.

322
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,370
We'll keep walking this way.

323
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,230
We'll reach my house after crossing the seventh bridge.

324
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,080
If I knew it was so toilsome for you to come home,

325
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,210
I would have let you take more days off.

326
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,100
I'm used to it.

327
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,570
It's the same for non-Shanghainese working in Shanghai.

328
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,810
Hardship can never beat us. It'll only make us stronger.

329
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,680
This bridge is called Bazi Bridge.

330
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,130
There's a Dongshuang Bridge over there.

331
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,300
The bridge in front of our house is called Jiujie Bridge.

332
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,950
There's a nursery rhyme about our hometown.

333
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:04,300
"Row, row. Row to granny's bridge."

334
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,100
What comes after that?

335
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,170
"Row to granny's bridge."

336
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,560
"Granny bought me a sweet bean paste bun for me."

337
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,320
The sweet bean paste bun is from your hometown.

338
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,230
Ours is glutinous rice cake.

339
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,860
After you deep fry the glutinous rice cake and dip it in osmanthus sugar,

340
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,360
it's truly appetizing.

341
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,900
Let's stop talking and go to have some.

342
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Let's go and get some tasty food.

343
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,330
Is there anyone home?

344
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,360
My baby girl is back!

345
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,910
You could have told me earlier so I could pick you up.

346
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,910
It's okay.

347
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,850
This is...

348
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,020
Hello, sir and madam.

349
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,100
Mengmeng, why didn't you tell me that you'd bring your boyfriend home?

350
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,850
So I could do my hair and look pretty.

351
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,730
Don't speak nonsense.

352
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,530
He's my best friend.

353
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,870
I brought him back to let you teach him how to make mooncakes.

354
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,150
You must teach him properly.

355
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,210
You're Mengmeng's best friend? Welcome!

356
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,520
I happened to have prepared food.

357
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,030
Let's go inside. Okay.

358
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,470
- Dad, take these.
- Ning, serve the dishes.

359
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,660
Come, give them to me.

360
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,710
Okay, let's go.

361
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,000
This is the last dish.

362
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,640
It's my signature dish: chicken marinated in wine.

363
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,030
What's your name?

364
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,160
My last name is Lu.

365
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,700
Lu, start digging.

366
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,060
Lu,

367
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,510
Mengmeng didn't tell us in advance.

368
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,110
So we didn't prepare much.

369
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,160
These are all Mengmeng's favorite homemade dishes.

370
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,810
Are these to your liking?

371
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes, I like them; they're very tasty.

372
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,570
You didn't even have a bite.

373
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,210
Lu, don't be nervous.

374
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,750
Take this as your home. Okay?

375
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,190
Okay.

376
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,500
- Try this one.
- Get him one piece.

377
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,450
This is our local specialty: Rice Vinasse Chicken.

378
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,420
It's marinated with the vinasse of Shaoxing wine.

379
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,580
- It's very good.
- Okay.

380
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,050
By the way, Lu, where are you from?

381
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,300
You don't sound like you're from Jiangzhe.

382
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,560
His family is from Northeast China.

383
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,220
Northeast China?

384
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,300
He's from Northeast China.

385
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,230
He does look like he's from there.

386
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,620
He is bulky.

387
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,190
Mengmeng,

388
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,970
is he from the same hometown as your ex-boss?

389
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,730
Did Mengmeng tell you about her ex-boss?

390
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,940
Like how you describe it back in your hometown, he's very hateful.

391
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,420
No, loathsome. He's a loathsome nuisance.

392
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,100
Have some glutinous rice cake.

393
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,900
- Your dad has high blood sugar. He can't eat this.
- Right.

394
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,870
You can eat it.

395
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,480
Lu is pretty nice. He's very polite.

396
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,360
He's not like her ex-boss, who was bad-tempered.

397
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,450
Very bad-tempered.

398
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,800
It's very bad, you know?

399
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,130
You talk as if you know him very well.

400
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,960
Sir,

401
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,980
I'm Ning Meng's ex-boss.

402
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,620
Really?

403
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,520
Enough talking already.

404
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,040
Let's eat.

405
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,350
Well...

406
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,570
Here. Eat a piece of glutinous rice cake.

407
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,900
This is the one I said about dipping in osmanthus sugar.

408
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,110
Yes, it's really good.

409
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,250
- Try it out.
- Yes, try it.

410
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,730
The sheets and covers are all new.

411
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,620
If you need anything, just tell me.

412
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,180
About what they said earlier, my dad didn't do it on purpose.

413
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,240
It's my fault for not telling him.

414
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,670
It's okay.

415
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,820
I'm already giving you trouble for coming here.

416
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,870
No, not at all.

417
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,870
My parents like trouble.

418
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
Get some rest.

419
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,320
Okay. You, too.

420
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,660
How was I supposed to know?

421
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,380
Let's ask her later.

422
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,760
Come here.

423
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,560
Why did you bring your ex-boss home?

424
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,720
I thought you didn't like him?

425
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,190
That's right. Did anything happen to him?

426
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,480
He looked dejected when he arrived.

427
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,390
Something happened to his family.

428
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,870
Someone plotted against his dad's company.

429
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:02,790
To save his dad's company, Mr. Lu used all of his savings.

430
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,280
In the end, it was all in vain.

431
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,870
Mr. Lu Senior suffered

432
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:11,260
from the huge blow and passed away from illness.

433
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,490
The company Mr. Lu founded was also dragged down.

434
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,800
He's also in huge debt now.

435
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,170
It's pitiful after hearing all these.

436
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,170
Yes.

437
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,690
He feels dispirited now.

438
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,770
I thought he'd be all alone in Shanghai,

439
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,060
so I brought him back home to celebrate the festival with us.

440
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,180
It's okay to celebrate the festival together.

441
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,860
- But you should have told us in advance.
- That's right.

442
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,130
- Did you see how awkward it was during dinner just now?
- He's right.

443
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,660
I thought you didn't know what awkwardness means.

444
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,120
After hearing what happened,

445
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,380
- Lu seems to be a good and filial kid.
- He is filial.

446
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,490
- He has good character, too.
- Yes, he does.

447
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,510
Dad, can you help me encourage him?

448
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,690
Use your rich experience in life to enlighten him

449
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,080
so he'll regain his will to fight.

450
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,270
Regain the will to fight.

451
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:03,520
That's not hard.

452
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,450
Mengmeng, are you helping him so much because you like him?
