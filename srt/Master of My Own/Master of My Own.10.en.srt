00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,519
(Episode 10)

2
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,879
- Ning Meng, morning. - Good morning.

3
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,199
The boss is waiting for you in the office.

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,439
She's not in a good mood.

5
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,159
That troublemaker Ms. Xu is here too.

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,159
Xu Si Tian?

7
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,480
What is she doing here?

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
Maybe it's something to do with the project.

9
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
I'm not sure.

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,680
She kept saying your name.

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,530
Prepare yourself.

12
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,120
Ms. Shi, Ms. Xu.

13
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,639
Come, Ning Meng.

14
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,639
Here, Ning Meng. Have some water.

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Ning Meng.

16
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,639
Mr. Lu told you the situation, right?

17
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,080
I want to know what you think.

18
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
There's definitely a problem...

19
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,159
with Y2 Property Group's financial situation.

20
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,639
I can't say for sure if they fabricated it...

21
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,679
but there is certainly a problem...

22
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
with the liquidity.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Shi Ying.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,960
You were a sponsor before.

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
You've seen a lot of public companies.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,718
Which company...

27
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,240
couldn't fix their liquidity problem?

28
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,879
Isn't it fine as long as it's legal?

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,719
What do you think, Ning Meng?

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Many people think that financial statements...

31
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,400
are like photos of beautiful ladies.

32
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,120
They have to be pretty and presentable.

33
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,559
But I think financial statements...

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
are more like an X-ray.

35
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,438
If you retouch the X-ray,

36
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,280
then what's the point of it?

37
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
Okay, I admit that you're right.

38
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,199
But we have a problem now.

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,080
Shouldn't we think how to solve it first...

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
instead of shutting it down completely?

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,839
Ms. Xu, we don't even know...

42
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,520
if the 30 million-dollar gap can be covered.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
And the offering date is coming up soon.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Let's put aside the money for now.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
Should anything go wrong,

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,959
the reputation of both Eaglestone and Joint Capital...

47
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,000
will be affected.

48
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,319
It's not that serious.

49
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,199
Isn't the problem just money?

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've decided.

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,158
Have Y2 Property Group's natural person shareholder...

52
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,400
lend 30 million to the company in the form of a loan...

53
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,080
and sign another loan agreement.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,159
Won't the liquidity problem be solved then?

55
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,400
Ning Meng.

56
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,598
This is a legitimate procedure.

57
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,639
Don't worry.

58
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,519
Si Tian.

59
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,680
Are you sure the shareholder...

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
will be willing to lend their own money?

61
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:25,439
Of course.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,839
As long as it is not a human problem.

63
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,920
Money problems can all be solved.

64
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll leave you guys to talk. I need to take this.

65
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,639
Sorry, Ms. Wang.

66
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,170
I had to go on so many business trips.

67
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,610
I've been so busy.

68
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,120
Ning Meng.

69
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,610
Actually, there's no problem about this with Shi Ying.

70
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,519
It's just Mr. Lu.

71
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,879
Can you...

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,050
lend me a hand?

73
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,438
Me?

74
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,680
Aren't you the liaison?

75
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,278
Help me liaise with him.

76
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,800
No, you two are good friends.

77
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,170
It's easier for you to talk to him.

78
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,240
If I knew how, then...

79
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,639
Ning Meng, look.

80
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,959
Y2 Property Group and I...

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,879
do have some overlapping interests.

82
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,279
I was the one who introduced the capital increase project.

83
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,680
Then I'm getting them to be the limited partner...

84
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,800
for the RV camp project.

85
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,079
Shouldn't I avoid rumors on Ming Ming's side?

86
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,000
But he doesn't listen to me.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,719
No.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,919
To be precise, he doesn't listen to anyone.

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,079
Why wouldn't he?

90
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,519
He loves to listen to you.

91
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,120
Didn't he pass on the RV camp project...

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,480
because he listened to you?

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,240
Don't be anxious.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,399
I've forgiven you about the RV camp project.

95
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,959
Ning Meng.

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,040
So? Where were we?

97
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,120
Shi Ying.

98
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,838
Ning Meng promised me...

99
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,879
she'd talk to Mr. Lu.

100
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,199
Right, Ning Meng?

101
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,318
Thanks, Ning Meng.

102
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,519
I'll treat you to a Michelin meal.

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,879
Ms. Shi, Ms. Xu.

104
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,398
I still think there are more uncertainties...

105
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,480
with Y2 Property Group.

106
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,239
When I went to their office,

107
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,759
I noticed poor management.

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,600
That's why I understand...

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,040
Mr. Lu's concern.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,639
Okay, you do.

111
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,319
But that doesn't keep you from talking to him, right?

112
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,000
It's decided, Ning Meng.

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,399
Here, have some water.

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Ning Meng.

115
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,560
When looking at the problems,

116
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,839
we can't just look at one side.

117
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,879
It is important to see both the small...

118
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,360
and the big picture.

119
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,399
In recent years, the property market has cooled down greatly.

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
Real estate companies are having a hard time.

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
It's the same for Y2 Property Group.

122
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,920
At this time,

123
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,040
companies want to develop some businesses...

124
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,360
to save themselves.

125
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,399
There's nothing wrong with that, right?

126
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,680
This last-minute change of limited partners...

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,240
is a solution.

128
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,839
But that also comes with risks.

129
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,999
How about this?

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,319
Take a day out of your schedule.

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,199
Let's not make any hasty decisions.

132
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,079
Find out more...

133
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,399
regarding Y2 Property Group.

134
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,480
The problem is with them after all.

135
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,480
So if they want to make up for it,

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,720
they should show some sincerity.

137
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,959
Okay. Don't worry, Shi Ying.

138
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll go now.

139
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,519
Ning Meng.

140
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,000
You should think it over.

141
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,480
When making decisions,

142
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,959
you have to listen...

143
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,600
to the opinions of the majority...

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
and discuss with a few.

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
In the end, you make your own decisions.

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,959
No matter what you decide,

147
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,720
I don't mind as long as it makes sense.

148
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,199
But before that,

149
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
there's something you need to do.

150
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,160
Have adequate communication.

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,279
Actually,

152
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,600
Mr. Lu cares about what you think.

153
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,439
Remember the matter with the document delivery?

154
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
You threw a fit at him.

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,199
I heard...

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,000
that Mr. Lu also called the other side...

157
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,480
to have them ask for the documents all together,

158
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
so that it would be convenient for everyone.

159
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,439
Anyhow,

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,199
I've opened my door for you.

161
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,519
I'll need you to knock on Mr. Lu's door.

162
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,159
(Xu Si Tian: How is it going on your side?)

163
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,879
Ning Meng, let's eat.

164
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,799
I'm not going. You guys go.

165
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,039
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

166
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,600
- Okay, we'll go ahead. - Okay.

167
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,519
Ning Meng.

168
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,919
I'm not a part of the project, so I don't know the details.

169
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,600
But...

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,519
you know how Ms. Shi is.

171
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,720
I can tell she's anxious.

172
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,398
But despite that,

173
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,450
she didn't snap at you, did she?

174
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,759
Ms. Shi was very nice to me.

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
None of us wants to let her down.

176
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,039
I know what you mean.

177
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,639
I'll get going then.

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,879
You should go.

179
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,399
I think...

180
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,559
the problem...

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
is not the money.

182
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,720
It's the people.

183
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,480
You didn't tell me in detail...

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,639
but you should know how much a general partner can earn...

185
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,639
through a simple capital increase project like this.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,120
So what exactly is your boss thinking about?

187
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,090
Is it the profit?

188
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Of course not.

189
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,600
It's the long-term benefit.

190
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,090
If you change the limited partner,

191
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,559
doesn't that mean...

192
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
you're cutting off their escape route?

193
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,159
So you also think I should compromise with my boss?

194
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,559
It's not compromising.

195
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,039
It's a gamble between the two general partners.

196
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,799
You're an analyst.

197
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,759
You don't have to do things...

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,090
like overstepping the bounds of your authority.

199
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,559
However,

200
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,039
it's all about your attitude.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,210
Whose side are you on?

202
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,559
One is your current boss.

203
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,320
The other is your former boss.

204
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,919
You have to think about it.

205
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,480
(Xu Si Tian: So? Is it done?)

206
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,000
Mr. Lu, well...

207
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,919
Can we meet and talk?

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,480
It's about the changing of limited partners.

209
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,039
Ms. Shi asked you to come?

210
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,039
I've told her everything this morning.

211
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,440
There's a new solution for the funding.

212
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,279
Let's talk it out.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,639
Suit yourself. I'm busy.

214
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,279
Meet me at the fencing gym.

215
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,639
Inside.

216
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,879
Mr. Lu.

217
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,279
Mr. Lu.

218
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,759
Let's talk after I finish this match.

219
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Wait for me upstairs.

220
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,399
Ready, go.

221
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,720
Ready.

222
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,039
Go.

223
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
So? What can I do for you?

224
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,240
I've got another match in a minute.

225
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,918
That was close.

226
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,279
I thought you were going to lose.

227
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I don't lose.

228
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,600
You were waiting for an opening.

229
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,759
The opponent was quick to rush to take the lead...

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
while you chose to back away and defend.

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,080
You wanted to take advantage of their advances...

232
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,720
to find a chance to counter-attack and win.

233
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,399
Sometimes when you want to win so badly,

234
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,399
you will end up losing everything instead.

235
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,759
So you do know about fencing.

236
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,960
Tell me.

237
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,000
What kind of last-minute solution did you find this time?

238
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,559
What are you laughing about?

239
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,840
Didn't you come to me...

240
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,639
for the issue with the limited partner?

241
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,000
You were cool at the end.

242
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,559
Good luck.

243
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,200
What do you mean?

244
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,600
Ms. Shi, I've decided.

245
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,279
Tell me.

246
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,679
I agree with Mr. Lu...

247
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
to replace the limited partner.

248
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,960
Apart from what you told me this morning,

249
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,639
do you have any other reason that can convince me?

250
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,200
I think in any industry,

251
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,759
integrity is the bottom line.

252
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,559
Even if there are benefits and favors,

253
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,080
that line should never be crossed.

254
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,919
I want to protect it.

255
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
And?

256
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,278
I know that in the capital market,

257
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,159
a lot of things aren't just black and white.

258
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,679
But the market is like a competition.

259
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,000
An ill-timed attack is a bold move.

260
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,559
It could leave loopholes and risks.

261
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,799
I can tell...

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,159
that you've put your heart and soul into Eaglestone.

263
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,759
I want it to achieve success too.

264
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,200
I want it to win beautifully...

265
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,879
in the long run.

266
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,410
Ms. Shi.

267
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,599
I mean it.

268
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,559
Ning Meng.

269
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,240
I'm really happy...

270
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,839
you are able to tell me this.

271
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,890
I agree.

272
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,999
I'll call Mr. Lu and Si Tian...

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,480
and let them know.

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,170
Ning Meng.

275
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
Thank you.

276
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,170
Thank you, Ms. Shi.

277
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
Ms. Xu.

278
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,200
Why are you doing this to me?

279
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,200
What did I ever do to you?

280
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,359
At Joint Capital, you turned down the RV camp project.

281
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,000
Now you're causing trouble again.

282
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
I've talked to Ms. Shi about it.

283
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,519
And she agreed.

284
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,240
I'm sure Ms. Shi has made clear of the reason to you.

285
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,798
Ning Meng.

286
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,559
You're so two-faced.

287
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,000
You brought up Mr. Lu this morning.

288
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,480
Now you're using Ms. Shi to oppress me.

289
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,920
I know what your motives are.

290
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,279
How could I have any motives?

291
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,000
Whether who has motives regarding this project,

292
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,799
you should know.

293
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
What?

294
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm not stealing or robbing.

295
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,720
I understand that you want to work on the RV camp project.

296
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,519
But the more you rush it, the more mistakes you'll make.

297
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,599
There is also the consideration of investment risk.

298
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,889
You should evaluate it properly.

299
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,720
Shut up. You don't have to teach me.

300
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,000
I studied EMBA. What about you?

301
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,799
You've only been at Eaglestone for a while.

302
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,279
But you're teaching me?

303
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Say something.

304
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,519
Didn't you tell me to shut up?

305
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,409
If you don't make it clear to me,

306
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,599
don't even think about going through the door.

307
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
This is my house.

308
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,359
Ning Meng, you're really interesting.

309
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,240
It's your house?

310
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,039
Whose house is this?

311
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
This Shi Ying's house.

312
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,170
If she didn't pity you,

313
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,680
could you have afforded this house?

314
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,359
You're living at her house,

315
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,039
yet you're backstabbing her.

316
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,319
You're really something.

317
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,440
Please step aside.

318
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,480
Trying to run away because you can't explain?

319
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,720
Are you two rapping?

320
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,440
Why did you want to see me? Let's go inside.

321
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,680
Who wants to see you?

322
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,650
Not you. I'm talking to Ning Meng.

323
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,409
Can't you see that we're going to fight?

324
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,999
Zeng Yu Hang, don't touch me!

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,039
Ning Meng!

326
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,598
Open the door!

327
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:54,279
Open the door if you dare, Ning Meng!

328
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,649
Why are you fighting with her?

329
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,798
What she says doesn't count.

330
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,440
Talk to Ming Ming.

331
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,799
Talk to me! This isn't over!

332
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,440
Why did you hit me?

333
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,839
What are you doing?

334
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Why are you here?

335
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,519
I came to pick up Y2 Property Group's documents.

336
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,679
What's going on?

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,000
Ms. Xu is inside.

338
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,439
Xu Si Tian.

339
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,000
What's wrong with you?

340
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,599
Don't you know they've been using you this whole time?

341
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,170
You don't even know you were being played.

342
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,279
Now you came all the way here to beg.

343
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,169
I think all the hyaluronic acid and Botox...

344
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,798
you injected all these years...

345
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,890
have gone to your head.

346
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,559
That's enough. Stop it.

347
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,480
So what?

348
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:03,679
Isn't it normal for projects to have problems?

349
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,079
It's not like it's completely unsolvable.

350
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,839
Forget it if you won't help me. Did you have to yell at me?

351
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,999
That's not what Ming Ming meant.

352
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,319
Don't take it to heart.

353
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,680
Tell me.

354
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,038
You studied EMBA.

355
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,758
Don't you know if there will be profit?

356
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,959
How many years has it been since you returned from abroad?

357
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,999
What have you done all this while?

358
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,719
Tian Tian has her way of thinking.

359
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
Aren't her projects interesting?

360
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,559
Don't try to cover for her.

361
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,000
They were a bunch of ridiculous projects.

362
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,239
Were any of them followed up?

363
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,119
Has she ever researched or taken any of them seriously?

364
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,278
You're always so impatient.

365
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:33,599
You believe everything people say.

366
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,409
When things aren't right, you blame the environment and bad luck...

367
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,410
and that people won't help you.

368
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,798
Don't cry.

369
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,078
Lu Ji Ming!

370
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,039
Who are you to say that about me?

371
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,650
Yes, I'm not good at studying.

372
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,479
I'm stupid and inexperienced, unlike you.

373
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,759
It's all my fault that my projects were a bust!

374
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,038
What else can you do...

375
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,200
besides crying and complaining?

376
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,439
Lu Ming Ming, stop it.

377
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
Of course I won't.

378
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,599
If she's like this forever,

379
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,799
nothing will go right, let alone investing!

380
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,559
Fine!

381
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,880
Leave me alone!

382
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,160
What are you looking at?

383
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,359
I can't believe this would happen to Ms. Xu.

384
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,519
How does it feel to be avenged?

385
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,919
What are you talking about?

386
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,079
I have no grudges against her.

387
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:32,319
You're right.

388
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,119
Actually, Ms. Xu is quite pitiful.

389
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,960
Her dad favors his son.

390
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,079
He'll give the company to her brother.

391
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,838
She won't even get a cent.

392
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,078
Nothing at all.

393
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,720
Of course she won't be able to invest.

394
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,118
And she can only use the money...

395
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,960
to buy handbags, watches, and clothes.

396
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,119
That's it.

397
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,119
Are you okay?

398
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Go away.

399
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,440
Come back here.

400
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,359
Is anyone there?

401
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,920
Does anyone have paper?

402
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,880
Thank you.

403
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,319
Don't mention it.

404
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,720
Why are you here?

405
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,598
If I knew it was yours,

406
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:34,799
I'd rather die than use it.

407
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
Give it back then.

408
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,880
I...

409
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,319
I'll transfer the money to you later.

410
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,440
You can have it for free.

411
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,240
You're here to mock me, aren't you?

412
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,960
You're overthinking it.

413
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,720
Isn't this what you wanted to see?

414
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,319
Good for you.

415
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,119
Ms. Xu.

416
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,400
I treat all projects as they are.

417
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,440
I was never against you personally.

418
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,399
Can you swear...

419
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
that you've never once not liked me?

420
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,599
That you've never hated me?

421
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,279
See? You can't say it.

422
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,839
You're just jealous of me.

423
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,839
You're jealous that I'm prettier than you.

424
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,119
That I have a nicer body,

425
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,518
have more connections,

426
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,839
and am closer to Lu Ji Ming.

427
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,640
Like you said,

428
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,599
you're better than me at everything.

429
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,519
Then why are you the one crying?

430
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,279
I know all of you look down on me.

431
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,839
My dad looks down on me too.

432
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,559
Lu Ji Ming also looks down on me.

433
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,119
Even you look down on me!

434
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
All of you don't understand me.

435
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,279
For the project,

436
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,240
I've faked so many smiles.

437
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
I've looked into all the contacts that I have.

438
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,559
Do you know?

439
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,000
I know.

440
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,279
Of course I do.

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,359
This is the daily life of regular workers.

442
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,279
You've never experienced that before.

443
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
Right?

444
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,440
What?

445
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,160
No matter what,

446
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,519
I'm better than you.

447
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,960
Even my card has more credit than yours.

448
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,000
You can't be so sure.

449
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,079
After all this investing,

450
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,920
the credit in my card will only go up.

451
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,319
In two years, we'll see who's better.

452
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,200
Then...

453
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,558
Then I won't give up either.

454
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,759
I'll do my best too.

455
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,960
You'll still lose to me.

456
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,720
Okay. Good luck.

457
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,959
However, if you weren't saying that...

458
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,719
with that face of yours,

459
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,839
you would be more convincing.

460
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,960
What happened to my face?

461
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,639
What kind of paper did you give me?

462
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,839
You completely ruined my face.

463
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,759
How can I face others later?

464
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,880
What brand is this?

465
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,799
My face is too expensive for this.

466
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Give it back then.

467
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,680
I'm asking you. What brand is it?

468
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,599
It's good.

469
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,559
Send me the link later.

470
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,119
Check on her.

471
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Don't drag me like I'm a prisoner.

472
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,799
Tian Tian, are you all right?

473
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,640
Why wouldn't I be?

474
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,400
Are you busy tonight? I'll buy you a drink.

475
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,000
I have paperwork to do.

476
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,799
Everyone has gone home.

477
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:30,839
Do it tomorrow.

478
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,680
Send me the link later.

479
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,640
What's with these two?

480
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,919
I heard the friendships of modern women...

481
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,880
usually start with sending links.

482
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,078
And then they blossom when they both hate...

483
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,279
the same people.

484
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,960
Hate? Who is it?

485
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,200
Me.

486
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,400
What are you doing?

487
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,079
Waiting for delivery.

488
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,400
You know what? He yelled at me.

489
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,798
He said I have no brain and can't do anything.

490
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,279
That nothing will go right.

491
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,200
In his eyes, I'm never right.

492
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,599
Don't drink too much.

493
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,319
Say, am I blind?

494
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,000
Why would I like him when he's so annoying?

495
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,400
Actually, it's not like there's nothing good about him.

496
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,759
What's good about him? Tell me.

497
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,200
Nothing, right?

498
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Let me think.

499
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,000
He's good-looking and tall.

500
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,119
I think he's actually quite principled.

501
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,000
Like when he cut off Y2 Property Group.

502
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,359
He only did it for your own good.

503
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,160
I know, he's protective.

504
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
He's been like this since school.

505
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,839
Oh, right.

506
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,558
When it comes to not meaning what one says,

507
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,159
he must be number one.

508
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,720
His mouth is more piercing than the tip of a knife.

509
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,519
But actually, his heart is soft like hot tofu.

510
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,559
He's crazy and bossy.

511
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,838
If his nostrils don't flare over two meters,

512
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,160
he can't survive.

513
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,759
However,

514
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,480
he has the right to be crazy.

515
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,079
He has real ability.

516
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,879
I've been his mom for three years.

517
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,680
I've learned a lot from him.

518
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,440
Anyhow, at a closer look,

519
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,640
he's kind of a good person.

520
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,799
You've said so many good things all at once.

521
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,359
Do you like him?

522
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,838
Am I mad?

523
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,759
Did I get kicked in the head by a donkey?

524
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,480
You're right.

525
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,880
Ning Meng.

526
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,359
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,079
I kept going against you...

528
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,160
because I thought Ming Ming...

529
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,160
saw you that way.

530
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,359
What way?

531
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,359
You're crazy!

532
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,880
Did a donkey kick you in the head?

533
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,200
Lu Ji Ming likes...

534
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,640
I can't even finish my sentence.

535
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,359
You're not being very nice to me.

536
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,079
I'll drink as punishment.

538
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,240
That's enough.

539
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,519
Anyway, starting today,

540
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,240
you, Ning Meng,

541
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,599
are Xu Si Tian's best friend.

542
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,880
Cheers.

543
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,319
Great!

544
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,359
- You're amazing. - I'm happy!

545
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,279
Over here.

546
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,839
Open the door for me, Ning Meng.

547
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,440
Come on.

548
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,160
Ning Meng.

549
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,799
Don't throw up. You'll be home soon.

550
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,318
I'm glad you called.

551
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,960
Otherwise, she won't even find her way home.

552
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,239
I have let you experience...

553
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,000
the taste of driving a drunk home in the middle of the night.

554
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,279
I'll give you a ride.

555
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,078
It's okay. I didn't drink much.

556
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,920
It's not far. I can walk home.

557
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,640
All right. I'll see you next time.

558
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
- Okay. - Bye.

559
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,000
Be careful.

560
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm leaving. Bye.

561
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,640
Water.

562
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,799
Water!

563
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,200
Open it yourself.

564
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,000
Why did you drink so much?

565
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,279
Because I'm happy today.

566
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,440
Do you know why?

567
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,720
Why?

568
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,079
Although I lost my love,

569
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,880
I was understood.

570
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,920
Hooray to understanding!

571
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,880
Wait a minute.

572
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,079
You lost your love?

573
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,160
You're giving up on Ming Ming?

574
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,279
I'll remove Lu Ji Ming...

575
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,119
from my love list.

576
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,519
Who else is there on your love list?

577
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,799
There's Spider-Man, Iron Man, Batman...

578
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,480
There's also the Hulk, right?

579
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,159
Are you sure that's a love list?

580
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,240
That's just the Avengers.

581
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,960
I don't care. I don't want them all now.

582
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,799
From now on, I, Xu Si Tian,

583
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,319
will focus on my career.

584
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,079
Will you support me?

585
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes. Definitely.

586
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,599
We're a team.

587
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,318
You're giving it your all.

588
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,920
Can't I risk my life for you?

589
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,039
Tian Tian, just go forward with courage.

590
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,440
I don't care what people say.

591
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,400
I'm always on your side.

592
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,798
Until you make it big.

593
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,480
I, Zeng Yu Hang, will be the first one to congratulate you.

594
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,319
Why are you looking at me?

595
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,599
Nothing.

596
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,559
You're pretty cool today.

597
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,160
Who is?

598
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,440
I'll stop.

599
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,960
Why did you only find out now?

600
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,279
Xu Si Tian.

601
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,400
Why did you only find out such an important fact?

602
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,319
Actually, I...

603
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,809
The new limited partner has been negotiated?

604
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,328
Mr. Lu is a man of his word.

605
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:24,519
He's very efficient.

606
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,199
There's a reason why he could stay in this industry...

607
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,599
though he's so young.

608
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
You'll take care of the rest.

609
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,599
You should know what to do by now.

610
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,639
But the clock is ticking. You should hurry.

611
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,479
Don't worry, Ms. Shi.

612
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,360
I won't make any mistakes this time.

613
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,559
(Copy)

614
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:47,960
Hello. I'm Ning Meng, an analyst at Eaglestone.

615
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:18,999
You should go eat.

616
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,400
When I hear from Mr. Lu, I'll tell you.

617
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,078
It's fine. There's no rush.

618
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,480
It's just one meal. I'll wait a little longer.

619
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,119
(Mr. Lu)

620
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,769
Hello, Mr. Lu.

621
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,558
Ms. Shi.

622
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,880
Everything is fine on our side.

623
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,119
Don't worry.

624
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,639
Don't tell Ning Meng yet.

625
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,399
See how she'll react.

626
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,440
Give her a scare.

627
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,000
Okay.

628
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,519
Thank you.

629
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,480
Is there a problem?

630
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,079
There shouldn't be. I paid special attention.

631
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,000
Then...

632
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,840
You scared me. My heart!

633
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,769
Mr. Lu told me to scare you.

634
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,239
Mr. Lu is really...

635
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,639
He's very childlike.

636
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,360
That's great.

637
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,639
We'll surely get the job done this time.

638
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:29,400
Although there were some mistakes in the early stage,

639
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,639
you made up for it later.

640
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,598
Especially when liaising with the new limited partner.

641
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,599
You kept your composure. Well done.

642
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,039
Ms. Shi, I should thank you...

643
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,159
for giving me the chance to make it up.

644
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
I forgot to tell you.

645
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,039
It was Mr. Lu who suggested...

646
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:45,519
to keep putting you in charge.

647
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,288
See?

648
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,840
He's so righteous.

649
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,289
You should appreciate his kindness.

650
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,920
I wish I could've seen her face.

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,039
It must've been so funny.

652
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,360
Can't you listen to me?

653
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,809
Lu Ji Ming, what are you doing here?

654
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,519
You said Tian Tian's brain is full of hyaluronic acid.

655
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,239
You're the one with lemon juice in your head.

656
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,238
What about that head of yours?

657
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,289
- I... - It's empty.

658
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,159
Tell me. What is it?

659
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,238
Recently, a clothing company...

660
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,440
has a lack of funds.

661
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,289
Would you be interested to provide bridging funds?

662
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,518
The interest is ten percent for three months.

663
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,039
At the end of the term, principal and interest will be paid.

664
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:43,920
Joint Capital will be the guarantor.

665
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,480
What a wonderful thing!

666
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,199
Then why aren't you earning interest with this?

667
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,840
Ten percent interest is too low.

668
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:54,239
I'm not interested.

669
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,079
Get Tian Tian.

670
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,078
Otherwise, she'll take the money...

671
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,769
to buy five percent of the bank's wealth management.

672
00:38:00,769 --> 00:38:02,840
Now, she'll get to earn double the interest.

673
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,039
You're using me as your raft...

674
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,119
to bring Tian Tian along to get rich together.

675
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,678
Lu Ming Ming.

676
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:15,639
I know you care about your friends.

677
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Why are you being shy?

678
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,519
You're so cute.

679
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,769
Who cares about who?

680
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:24,999
I'm just afraid you can't do anything right...

681
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,079
and embarrass me.

682
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,289
All right. We won't.

683
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,559
In the future, introduce more of these profitable projects to me.

684
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,039
From now on, you'll have me for the rest of your life!

685
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,920
Bye.

686
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,440
I'm still your man when you leave.

687
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,079
Mr. Lu.

688
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Just got off work?

689
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,119
Going downstairs?

690
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,039
Thank you.

691
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,400
Once I become a director,

692
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,289
I'll return the favor in double.

693
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,880
When you become a director,

694
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,679
I guess...

695
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,329
I'd have retired then.

696
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:18,840
Then I'll let you enjoy retirement life soon.

697
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,289
Wait, Ning Meng. What do you mean?

698
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:23,920
You're trying to piss me off...

699
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,329
and inherit my inheritance, right?

700
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
Hello.

701
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,119
Hello, Ning Meng.

702
00:39:58,289 --> 00:39:59,329
Hello, Max.

703
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,639
I was about to call you.

704
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,079
Congratulations.

705
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,678
I didn't expect the sales to be so high...

706
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,679
after the new product went online.

707
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,400
It's all thanks to what you suggested before.

708
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,840
Don't mention it.

709
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,199
Locke's products are good in themselves.

710
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,840
I hope your company continues to do well.

711
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,480
Thank you so much.

712
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:20,119
I sent you a package of our latest product.

713
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,119
Early happy holiday to you.

714
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,039
Thank you. You too.

715
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,440
Thank you.

716
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,480
You're done with that new order?

717
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:45,480
Yes. I finished yesterday.

718
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,920
Not bad.

719
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,599
It's been a good three months.

720
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,328
I think private placement projects are the best.

721
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,559
There are no business trips.

722
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,329
When I worked on the early childhood education program,

723
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,519
I had to go to at least three places to do research.

724
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,480
That's great. I envy you.

725
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,289
You can get field experience.

726
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:04,329
This experience is so good.

727
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,719
But the coming vacation is a bust.

728
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,679
I thought...

729
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,639
I could go to a hot spring with my boyfriend.

730
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,840
And now, there goes our chance.

731
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,679
What about you? Any plans for the holidays?

732
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,840
Going out with anyone?

733
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,599
Who is it?

734
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,039
I'll find out sooner or later.

735
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,329
Holiday dinner?

736
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,359
You introduced Tian Tian and I to do the bridging fund.

737
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,599
We made some money.

738
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,809
We'll take the holiday as a chance to show our gratitude...

739
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,809
and treat you to a meal.

740
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,239
Come on. We're your people now.

741
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,519
What's wrong with you?

742
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,159
Just the three of us?

743
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,880
Tian Tian invited Ning Meng.

744
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,840
Ning Meng? Why?

745
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,289
I'll ask Tian Tian to cancel then.

746
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,809
Never mind. You already invited her.

747
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,199
You can't take it back.

748
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,289
Lu Ming Ming, you won't die if you don't play the big bad wolf.

749
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,329
- Thank you. - You're here.

750
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,289
Where's Ning Meng? Not here yet?

751
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,199
She can't come today because she has an appointment.

752
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:57,480
Could something have happened to Ning Meng?

753
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:00,599
Whatever.

754
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,159
You're here.

755
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:06,199
I ran into someone in the restroom.

756
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,558
Who is it?

757
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,519
Mr. Su, you've met him before.

758
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,559
Him? Something feels off about him.

759
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,809
What's wrong with him now?

760
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,119
Excuse me.

761
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:21,559
That's Ning Meng, right?

762
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:24,359
It is.

763
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Ning Meng.

764
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:27,679
Have a seat.

765
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:30,920
Sorry, I'm late.

766
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,079
No, you're right on time.
