Don't check. Don't check.

Go ahead.

101
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,230
I have a friend.

102
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,880
He was drunk.

103
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,340
He accidentally kissed a girl when he was drunk.

104

What do you think the girl would think?

105
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,550
What the girl would think depends on whether the man is handsome or not.

106
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,452
If he is handsome, the girl will inevitably overthink.

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,650
How should I put it?

108
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,980
I think the guy is pretty good-looking.

109
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
Pretty good-looking?

110
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,670
Lu Mingming, you've never admitted that anyone is better looking than you.

111
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,230
The man is not you, is he?

112
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,440
The girl can't be Ning Meng, can she?

113
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,420
What did you two do?

114
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,760
How is that possible?

115
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,876
Lu Mingming, we grew up together.

116
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,550
You can't hide anything from me.

117
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,200
What am I hiding from you?

118
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,110
With the way you two have been behaving these past two days,

119
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,690
how can I not be suspicious?

120
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,230
Whenever I thought I was overthinking it,

121
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,880
you and she forced me to think that way.

122
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,340
I'll ask you directly.

123
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,680
What did you two do that night after you got drunk?

124
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,840
What did I do?

125
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,660
Didn't you sleep in my room that night?

126
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,256
Lower your voice.

127
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,320
Stop eating. Let's go.

128
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,920
Get the bill.

129
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,696
I... I'm going to take out the trash.

00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:00,732
I'm coming home.

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,016
Well... That...

132
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,446
What?

133
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,249
Well...

134
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,248
I knew there was something wrong with you two.

135
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:27,280
You can't deny it this time, can you?

136
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Be honest. How far have you two gotten?

137
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,072
Did you kiss?

138
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,770
Lu Mingming, that's dirty.

139
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,790
No, don't you know that's dirty?

140
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,540
It's your fault for talking too much.

141
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,508
You are still blaming me?

142
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:52,022
You kept a big deal from me about you and Ning Meng.

143
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,690
It was an accident.

144
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,100
Accident?

145
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,556
Do you dare to say you don't have any feelings for Mengmeng?

146
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:01,300
What Mengmeng?

147
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,860
It's sickening, disgusting, and unappetizing.

148
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,000
It's been so long since Ning Meng resigned.

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,260
You're still involved with her all the time.

150
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,000
Why do I feel that you are doing this on purpose?

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,300
I feel comfortable with her as my secretary.

152
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,100
Now she seems to be good at investing, too.

153
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,148
If she could return to Joint Capital, she would be a good helper.

154
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:27,200
That's the case. I'm too lazy to argue with you.

155
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,660
Excuses.

156
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,590
Lu Mingming, there's something I don't know if I should say.

157
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,370
Don't say it if you shouldn't.

158
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,070
I'm going to say it.

159
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,054
I know what you think.

160
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,810
Fine, I won't talk to you about Mengmeng today.

161

Let's talk about Yimeng.

She won't come back.

166
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,158
Besides, isn't she already engaged?

167
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,610
She's not engaged yet.

168
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,780
Moreover, it's only an engagement, not a marriage.

169
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,144
What kind of logic is that?

170
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,888
Fine. Even if she gets married,

171
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:14,610
will you wait until she gets divorced?

172
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,270
What did you say?

173
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,030
I'm just trying to get you to think straight.

174
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,840
As the saying goes, all roads lead to Rome,

175
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,456
so why get stuck on one person?

176
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,920
You don't understand. It's not the same.

177
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:35,270
Lu Mingming, with such a childish and shallow outlook on relationships,

178
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,780
you may be disheartened in the future.

179
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,490
Disheartened? Who would dishearten me?

180
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,910
Stop kidding.

181
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,462
My stance is very solid and steady.

182
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,816
Even if your stance is stable,

183
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:51,392
what if Ning Meng's stance isn't?

184
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,104
What do you mean?

185
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,890
You mean she likes...

186
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,670
That won't do. She can't like me.

187
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,910
Why didn't you explain yourself earlier?

188
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,330
Didn't you interrupt me earlier?

189
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,880
That's bad. She misunderstood it.

190
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,880
Who wouldn't overthink when you used taking out the rubbish

191
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,188
as an excuse for a chance encounter?

192
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,234
Especially this innocent Ning Meng.

193
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,256
You have sinned by winning her heart.

194
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:35,104
Zeng Yuhang, if you keep talking nonsense, get lost!

195
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,940
You're the one who should get lost. This is my home.

196
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,350
Mr. Lu, you have a meeting with Ms. Shi next week

197
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,430
to discuss the two companies' recent projects.

198
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,700
When do you think is the right time?

199
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,440
Let Ren Pengfeng attend that meeting. I have my own arrangements.

200
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Mr. Lu, didn't you say before

201
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,390
that you would personally take care of all the projects with Eaglestone...

202
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,694
It was not the same as it is now.

203
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Okay, I'll go and talk to Mr. Ren now.

All right.

209
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,360
I need to go on a business trip. There are two events next week.

210
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,411
One is an entrepreneurship competition in Nanjing,

211
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:16,470
and the other is a strategic cooperation meeting with Joint Capital.

212
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,420
Attend the meeting with Joint Capital for me.

213
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,940
Ms. Shi, can I attend the entrepreneurship competition?

214
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,690
I am thinking that I have been ruling out projects since I joined the company.

215
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,210
I'd like to reach out to new areas and explore some new projects, is that okay?

216
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,640
Okay, then go and broaden your horizons, gain some knowledge,

217
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,048
and expand your network.

218
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,820
- Ya.
- Ms. Shi.

219
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,490
Attend the meeting with Joint Capital for me.

220
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,740
Okay.

221
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,480
- Thank you, Ms. Shi.
- No problem.

222
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,620
- Ya, come with me.
- Okay.

223
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,840

224

<i>[Ning Meng, Investment Manager]</i>

225
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,540
Your current analyst title is a bit of a disadvantage when you go to the entrepreneurship competition,

226
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,660
so we got a new box of name cards for you.

227
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,580
This is wrong, right?

228
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,300
There's nothing wrong with it.

229
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,880
Ms. Shi is very thoughtful.

230
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,176
You need to be presentable for such social occasions.

231

Don't feel burdened.

Come.

246

Senior, it's on me this time.

247
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,460
It's fine. Come.

248
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,400
Last time, it was Huaiyang cuisine and this time it's fine Japanese cuisine,

249
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,990
I'm afraid I'll have to treat you to swan meat next time.

250
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,010
I don't mean that.

251
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,560
Right. What about the AR you mentioned last time?

252
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,068
Have you invested in it?

253
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,130
No.

254
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,948
I did some research after I got back.

255
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,470
Application scenarios and databases still need to be improved.

256
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,466
Its market positioning is also not very clear.

257
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:29,410
In terms of revenue, this company is still in its developmental phase.

258
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,590
It is unlikely to be profitable for at least the next two years.

259
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,990
But it may not be so after two years.

260
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,580
I think technology like this is going to be a big trend in the future.

261
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,560
I agree with this. But it's still too long a cycle.

262
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,274
Investment is not charity.

263
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,378
It's about returns and gains.

264
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,330
I know that capital markets are inherently profit-seeking.

265
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,160
But it would be nice to show a little sentiment

266
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,172
and integrity, wouldn't it?

267
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:12,021
It would be great if we could give them more room

268
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:16,800
and the opportunity to develop such new stuff made in China.

269
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,580
Actually, I really like this project too.

270
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,705
If I didn't like it, I wouldn't have shown it to you.

271
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:26,842
But you can't work on a project just by interest and hobby.

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,180
I had some of the same thoughts as yours when I first entered this industry.

273
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,390
However, you will find out over time

274
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,350
that in the capital markets, especially in our industry,

275
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,360
focusing on investment returns does not mean that we're profit-oriented.

276
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,236
I didn't mean that.

277
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,110
I know.

278
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,850
In the investment world, everyone sees projects differently.

279
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,050
Some people just think of it as a Texas Hold'em poker table,

280
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,778
where the resources in your hand are the undercard

281
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:04,760
and the project is the high card on the table.

282
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,210
The key is to match the cards and beat the opponent

283
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,390
in order to achieve success.

284
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,266
I am one of these profit-driven investors.

285
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,630
But perhaps, as you said,

286
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,450
there is a lack of integrity.

287
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,982
What about the other one?

288
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,280
The other type of investor is someone like you

289
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,160
who has a sentimental attachment to the project.

290
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,870
Maybe I have the heart of an old mother.

291
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,830
What kind of person do you think Mr. Lu is?

292
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,410
Mr. Lu?

293
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,580
I used to think he was supposed to be driven by rationality,

294
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,296
but then I think he isn't.

295
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,990
Actually, I can't really tell.

296
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,490
Mr. Lu covers himself up pretty well.

297
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,420
You had worked with him for three years

298
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,460
and you still don't know him well.

332
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Mr. Lu, wait a minute. Ning Meng is here.

Hi.

344
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,200
We're all going to the venue later.

345
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,000
Ning Meng, Mr. Lu is here as a judge.

346
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,900
Mr. Lu is not on the list of judges.

347
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,200
One of the judges was sick and couldn't make it,

348
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,500
so Mr. Lu volunteered to cover for him.

349
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,700
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met.

350

The technology in this project is amazing,

385
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,900
but its business model is not clear enough to have formed a closed loop for the business.

He's a sharp-tongued judge.

397
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I wonder if he usually talks like that.

398

Well, I'm quite tall. I'll give my speech here.

The feeling of love is the most wonderful feeling in this world.

But what is the most wonderful thing in love?

401
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,600
The feeling of kissing, of course.

402

This is the kissing device developed by our team.

It can send real-time transmission via a high-precision pressure sensor.

The pleasure of kissing can be felt even when two people are in different places.

Mr. Lu, you don't look convinced.

This is something to be acknowledged.

00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,000
I think the concept can be extended to many fields.

417
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,800
We can use it to measure blood pressure, heart rate, and blood oxygen

418
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,000
as well as use the big data to make medical reports

so that they can feel at ease.

This kissing device has given us great inspiration.

423

The technology and concept behind it is a good investment

424

Don't say yes blindly. It is an investment after all.

Miss, excuse me.

447
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,520
I have a question for you.

448
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,644
Do you usually go to the gym to work out?

449
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:15,350
I used to go to the gym.

450
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,900
- But then I stopped going because I have been too busy with work.
- Is that so?

451
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,720
- I even had an annual card at the gym before,

452
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,350
but the owner ran away in less than three months.
- Is that so?

453
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,281
I still haven't gotten my money back yet.

454
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,880
The phenomenon she describes does occur.

455
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,530
Because the entry requirements for the gym industry are so low, all kinds of people are mixed together.

456
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,950
It's these people who are ruining the reputation of the industry.

457
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,070
I think the business model of gyms is rather one-dimensional.

458
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,400
There is also a lot of homogeneous competition.

459
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,680
Besides, one of its biggest problems is that it is not very sustainable.

460
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,830
I mean once it has attracted all the people around a few kilometers,

461
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,680
it is difficult to get new customers.

462
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,190
Because many of the gym's mechanisms are still inadequate.

463
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,958
So, it is still very difficult for us to regulate them.

464
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,920
That makes sense.

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,740
<i>Do you want to buy tickets? Come and scan the code here.</i>

487
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,040

489
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,200
<i>Take it. Please go in.</i>

<i>[Xiasun Wharf]</i>
<i>Scan the code here.</i>

491
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:41,270
<i>Scan the code for tickets. 80 yuan per person.</i>

492
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,720
<i>Scan the code for tickets. 80 yuan per person.</i>

493
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:52,650
Hello.

494
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,430
<i>Hello, Ning Meng. Where are you?</i>

495
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,670
- I...
<i>- Send me your location.</i>

496
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,500
<i>Wait there for me. I"ll be right there.</i>

497
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,340
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

498
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,320
Miss, do you want to take the boat?

499
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,630
I'll take it later. I have to wait for someone.

500
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,070
Boyfriend?

501
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,330
That makes sense. You can't row this boat by yourself.

502
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,390
Do you want to buy tickets?

503
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,690
Come, scan the code here.

504
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,326
This is wrong.

505
00:35:41,326 --> 00:35:43,760
You need to keep your arms straight.

506
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,276
Lean forward, exert more strength.

507
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,530
Your frequency is not right.

508
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,900
You're so silly.

509
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,980
Do it yourself then.

510
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,076
All right, look carefully.

511
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,820
This is not right at all.

512
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,668
Spinning, huh?

513
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,200
There are so many places to choose from, why do you have to row a boat?

514
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,610
Mr. Lu, I was just going to row the boat alone for a while.

515
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:30,870
You were the one who called and asked me to wait for you.

516
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,970
Forget it, let's go back.

517
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,980
You have to be on the same frequency and in the same direction as me.

518
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,150
I'm in the same direction as you.

519
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,910
That's too fast. You're rowing it too fast.

520
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,670
You just can't keep up with me.

521
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,620
Seems that you've been practicing boxing for nothing. So useless.

522
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,250
Would you die if you didn't talk? The more you talk, the less energy I have.

523
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,354
I find you to be very psychologically weak.

524
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,200
I'm out of energy.

525
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,280
We are rowing the boat further and further away.

526
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,480
What's going on here?

527
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,012
Stupid, you're not even doing it right.

528
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:15,840
I'll stop rowing.

529
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,570
This is good, too.

530
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,126
We should have some time together and talk about it.

531
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,910
What do we need to talk about?

532
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,878
You know it.

533
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,852
The incident that day was purely accidental.

534
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,360
It was an accident indeed.

535
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,001
So, you mustn't think too much about it and don't take it to heart.

536
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,320
I didn't think much about it and I didn't take it to heart.

537
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,380
What are you shouting for?

538
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:09,634
No, didn't you bring this up first?

539
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,166
That's because I've given it some thought.

540
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,952
I really don't feel the same way about you as I do about other people.

541
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,470
Maybe...

542
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,026
I think of you...

543
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,050
as a buddy.

544
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,104
Ning Meng, you're good.

545
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:47,884
You're good enough to be my buddy.

546
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,180
You mustn't forget that one of the things I admire most about you

547
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,410
is that you have no illusions about me.

548
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,270
This is a quality you must keep.

549
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,390
I was afraid you'd have illusions about me.

550
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,586
How could that be?

551
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,660
I've had a crush on someone for a long time.

552
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,260
I see. Isn't that great?

553
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,720
You have your dream girl, I have my dream man.

554
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,330
Anyway, don't worry.

555
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,874
I will never like you.

556
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,170
Who is it? Pick up the call.

557
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,380
It's not important.

558
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,660
Do you still respect me as your ex-boss?

559
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,470
How dare you answer me so perfunctorily?

560
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,320
So you know you're my ex-boss?

561
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,430
Why should I report my personal matters to my ex-boss?

562
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,550
It's just Su Weiran, right?

563
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,114
What's the point of covering it up?

564
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,470
You know all about it and you're asking me?

565
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,050
You are so much more interesting than I am.

566
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,170
Is he the man you call your dream man?

567
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,030
You like him?

568
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,870
I have mixed feelings about my senior.

569
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,250
It's a bit mundane to use only the word "like" to sum it up.

570
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:22,098
I have feelings of adoration, admiration, respect, etc...

571
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,406
Anyway, I can't explain it to you.

572
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:30,018
No, Ning Meng, you have a problem with your taste.

573
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,390
We have called you many times.

574
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,170
Check the time. We're going to be off duty.

575
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,122
Okay! We'll give it back in a minute.

576
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,920
- Can you row properly?
- Don't move. I'm coming.

577
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,890
Not bad, Song. You're a good rower!

578
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,950
If I can drive a car well, I can row a boat well.

579
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,190
This is all part of the driving technique.

580
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,530
I'm really good at this.

581
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,692
Look over there, there.

582
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:29,800
They're dragged away, shame on them.

583
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,736
They just don't have a sense of direction.

584
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:34,920
Don't have a sense of direction.

585
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,390
Xiaoyang.

586
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,634
Look at that man, he looks like Mr. Lu.

587
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,270
It's really Mr. Lu.

588
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,730
- My goodness, hurry.
- Cover up! Cover me.

589
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,360
- Come here.
- Cover me up.

590
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,060
Cover up.

591
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,950
I think he saw us.

592
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,270
That can't be.

593
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,170
Slowly.

594
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,780
Be careful.

595
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,494
Thanks. I'll be off.
