1
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,820
Mr. Aoyama!

2
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,350
A year has passed,

3
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,700
but I still dream about him every night.

4
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:37,710
The shortest distance III: Fallen Flowers

5
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,010
One year ago,
I lost my penis in an incident.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,330
The guy responsible
was a former host called Seiya.

7
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,920
At the time,
- we were competing for clients at the same club.

8
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,600
A hotel worker came to my aid,

9
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,890
and I was hospitalized for a month.

10
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,440
But, even despite that,

11
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,420
Mr. Aoyama accepted me.

12
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,050
I can't please you sexually.

13
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,930
That's not true at all!

14
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,940
Though Mr. Aoyama is gone,
I still live in our apartment.

15
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,210
But on that day,

16
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,210
I learned who he really was.

17
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,820
Shibahara...

18
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm the same as Ruka.

19
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,480
Do you still wanna sleep with me?

20
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,150
I know.

21
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
Seiya did that to you, right?

22
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,940
Aoyama was one cruel bastard.

23
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,630
What do you mean?

24
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,730
Everything that happened

25
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,100
was part of his plan.

26
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,460
What?

27
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,730
The Aoyama that you knew

28
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,130
was only the tip of a giant iceberg.

29
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,440
Haruto!

30
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,740
Don't tell Ruka about this.

31
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,050
I'll call once
I hear about Takumi's boyfriend.

32
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,710
Yeah, about that...

33
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,380
It might be Seiya.

34
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,220
Mr. Aoyama said he was dead, though.

35
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,850
Seiya's still alive.

36
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,090
Hello?

37
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,740
Haruto, is that you?

38
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,290
I'm sorry.

39
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,270
I killed one of our clients.

40
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,720
I saw a delivery guy
leaving Takumi's place so I tailed him.

41
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
Turned out to be Seiya.

42
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,840
I thought as much.

43
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,470
What? You knew?

44
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,110
He broke up with Yazaki?

45
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,650
Not exactly.

46
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,140
They still see each other.

47
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,920
I'm coming in.

48
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm sorry, Mr. Yazaki.
I haven't dropped by much.

49
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,320
Please don't worry about it.

50
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,240
What are you reading?

51
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,870
Noir?

52
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,820
That's so like you.

53
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,330
It is?

54
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,420
Are you hungry?

55
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
Yeah. Seeing you has somehow
given me an appetite.

56
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,770
Great! I'll fix something up.
I'm no chef though...

57
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,610
Thank you.

58
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,440
I made us some kitsune udon.

59
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,050
Thanks!

60
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,700
Wow! It looks great!

61
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,930
My mother often made udon when I was a kid.

62
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,610
We were so poor,
she couldn't add ingredients.

63
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,380
It only contained onions and broth.

64
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,110
So you keep telling me.

65
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,440
That woman was my father's second wife.

66
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,810
She was a lady of the night, but she had a
refreshing personality and I loved her very much.

67
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,860
When I was involved in an incident during my high school days,
she was the only who stood up for me.

68
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,310
What kind of incident?

69
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,670
Back then, I worked part-time as a local rent boy.

70
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,470
Then one day, the scariest PE teacher
at our school came to us as a client.

71
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,210
I had always disliked the guy,
so I threatened him.

72
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,300
I told him to pay me
or I would inform the school.

73
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,800
Upon hearing this,

74
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,610
he went straight to the police!

75
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,160
I never knew that!

76
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,550
Seiya.

77
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm grateful for
you feeding me like this, but

78
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,230
I want to eat the udon by myself.

79
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

80
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,680
Thank you.

81
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,140
I don't think you can.

82
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,970
I can't keep relying on you.
I need to rehabilitate.

83
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,420
Mr. Yazaki.

84
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,760
I think you can come out of hiding soon.

85
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
What do you mean?

86
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,820
I've kept this quiet
but I've found a good source of income.

87
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,350
Some kid called Takumi.

88
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,000
He was a straight college student at first
but I've spent a year breaking him in.

89
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,260
Seiya, what are you planning?

90
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,860
I'm gonna make Takumi work
at Shibahara's club.

91
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,500
It's being managed by Yuki.

92
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,940
I can't go back to that world.

93
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,230
So I'll make Takumi work there
and support me instead.

94
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,760
Seiya.

95
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,360
- That's hardly admirable...
- This isn't the time to be admirable!

96
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,220
I don't care what it takes,
I want to save you from this miserable way of life.

97
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,970
Seiya!

98
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,660
This time...

99
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,060
It's my turn to help you.

100
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,360
What's Seiya up to?

101
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,130
Shibahara, you're too naive.

102
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,440
That's why we should've killed them both!

103
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,470
Hello?

104
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,960
What? Ruka?

105
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,060
Yeah.

106
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,570
Understood.

107
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,630
Right. I'm sorry.

108
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,380
Yes, please do.

109
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,680
Why did you kill him!?

110
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,200
Because he was an asshole.

111
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,340
Ruka.

112
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,790
Are you hurt?

113
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,410
No, I'm fine.

114
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,700
Mr. Shibahara said he'll sort this mess out.
In the meantime, Let's get outta here.

115
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,310
Sorry to cause you so much trouble.

116
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,250
Hey, it's over here.

117
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,560
Ken, check this out!

118
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,270
Put it down and gimme a hand.

119
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,370
Right.

120
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,880
I'll ensure the body is never found, but

121
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,870
there's gonna be a lot of questions asked.

122
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,920
I'll close the club until things cool down.

123
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,770
I'll pay the organization your remaining debt.

124
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:10,690
Naturally, you'll pay me back
with interest once the club reopens.

125
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,970
I understand.

126
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,530
Just in case, you better keep away from here.

127
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,690
You need to hide for the time being.

128
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,810
I'll call if I need you to do anything.
Be sure to remain contactable.

129
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,110
Mr. Aoyama.

130
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,120
I bit off Yuki's cock.

131
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,990
Yeah.

132
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,140
You'll really make me a joint owner now, right?

133
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,800
Yeah.

134
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,700
I understand.

135
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,900
Hey! Get the fuck off me!

136
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,680
Oh, and get me a cup of noodles.
The spicy ones.

137
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,700
And make it snappy.
I'm fucking starving here!

138
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,290
Yeah.

139
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,080
Where's Masaru?

140
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,800
Convenience store. He'll be back soon.

141
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,880
- Sit down and watch.
- Okay.

142
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,010
Who's this?

143
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,130
The new guy, Akira.

144
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,760
What's your deal?

145
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,940
I was an IT company director until recently.

146
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,770
My business was taken over,
leaving me broke.

147
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,250
I was screwed,
but Mr. Shibahara helped me out.

148
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,680
I mean, I'm a pretty inquisitive guy, right?

149
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,560
Besides, I've always wanted to
work for the underworld.

150
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,480
Why's he here?

151
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,570
To learn. We're gonna show him
how we do things.

152
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,020
Nice to meet you.

153
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,410
I can't get hold of Aoyama.
- Do either of you know where he is?

154
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,620
Seiya, don't try to protect him.

155
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Aoyama brought in one of his students,
then tried using you to eliminate him.

156
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,980
And what about you, Yazaki?

157
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,240
We know he was one of your partners

158
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:44,320
and that you tried outsmarting us
by fiddling the books to steal our money.

159
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,700
Where is that money now?

160
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,900
Shibahara, I don't care what happens to me,

161
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,590
but please don't hurt Seiya.

162
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,500
He's one of Aoyama's victims, too.

163
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,720
That's nothing to do with me.

164
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,220
Okay, okay! I'll tell you everything!

165
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,430
Just leave Seiya alone!

166
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,090
I'm all ears.

167
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,540
I have an apartment in Azabu.

168
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,070
It's a secret location known
only to Aoyama and me.

169
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:43,340
That's where he manages
the account books and seals.

170
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,180
You better not be lying.

171
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,260
It's the truth!

172
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,280
Untie him.

173
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,150
Sure.

174
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,170
What are you doing?

175
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
Akira, gimme a hand, will ya?

176
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,020
- What's the plan?
- Pin the old man down.

177
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,000
On it.

178
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,354
Stop!

179
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,805
Don't do this!

180
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,120
Sure you're not lying?

181
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,610
I guess not.

182
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,377
I'm coming in.

183
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:33,165
In the meantime,
Ruka and I went into hiding.

184
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:40,400
Pancakes! Pancakes!
You better turn out good!

185
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,860
Despite having killed someone,
Ruka was in a joyful mood.

186
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,180
Here you go!

187
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,690
My unique brand of pancakes!

188
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,540
They look great!

189
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,610
Give 'em a try!

190
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,240
Thanks, I will.

191
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Well? How are they?

192
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,440
Amazing!

193
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,930
Great!

194
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,990
I wrote a poem about pancakes years ago.

195
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,480
Wanna hear it?

196
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,680
Ruka...

197
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,200
What's wrong?

198
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,050
I spoke to Shibahara.

199
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:48,690
He said you and Mr. Aoyama
were an item some years ago.

200
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,280
What of it?

201
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,480
Can you tell me about it?

202
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,480
About what?

203
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
Your relationship with him.

204
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,710
Why?

205
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,600
Because I don't really know
what kind of person he was.

206
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,622
The man I knew and the one you dated
are like two different people, right?

207
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,880
It's a long story.

208
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,690
I don't mind.

209
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,062
I have all the time in the world.

210
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,760
Haruto...

211
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,890
Do you know the word "Rakka-Ryusui"?

212
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,060
"Rakka-Ryusui"?

213
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,660
Mr. Aoyama taught me it.

214
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,380
He said it's meant to
signify fallen petals flowing downstream.

215
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,590
Look.

216
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,670
If you reverse the middle two characters,
it spells my name.

217
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,160
Where did you get this diary?

218
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,660
Mr. Aoyama and I used to exchange diaries.

219
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,210
Fancy exchanging diaries with me?

220
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,200
Huh?

221
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,220
I can't wait to read it.

222
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:05,180
It's nothing special.

223
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,240
He said that "Rakka-Ryusui" is also a metaphor

224
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
that means idling one's time away
or parting with others.

225
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:23,005
Now I think of it, it's clear that
Mr. Aoyama had you in mind even back then.

226
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,450
Hello?

227
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,780
It's Shibahara from Rain and Soda Water.

228
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,090
Oh?

229
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
I'm calling to say you passed the interview.

230
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,330
Can you come by my office?

231
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,020
Of course!

232
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,330
Thank you!

233
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,880
Yes.

234
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,100
Got it.

235
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,210
Okay, I'll see you later.

236
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,154
Don't you need to get that?

237
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,380
Nah.

238
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,657
Please leave your message after the beep.

239
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,760
Seiya! I got the job
at Rain and Soda Water!

240
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,570
You're really hard.

241
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,760
Even though my body can barely move!

242
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,450
It's thanks to you
that I'm always ready to go.

243
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,950
That's why you're all mine.

244
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,350
Mr. Yazaki.

245
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,350
I'm putting it in.

246
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,380
Seiya, make us one.

247
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,040
Mr. Yazaki!

248
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,554
Seiya!

249
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,950
Mr. Yazaki! I stink of sweat!

250
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,422
Don't worry about that.

251
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,810
I want to enjoy your scent once more.

252
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,880
Mr. Yazaki!

253
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,890
Seiya!

254
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,188
Does it hurt?

255
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,411
No.

256
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,548
It feels good!

257
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,300
Mr. Yazaki!

258
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,640
I'm gonna cum!

259
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
Me too!

260
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,308
Mr. Yazaki!

261
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,660
I want you to cum hard inside me.

262
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,350
My pleasure.

263
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,360
Seiya!

264
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,670
This is the diary I exchanged with Mr. Aoyama.

265
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,800
I know.

266
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,000
He told me.

267
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,770
He said I reminded him of a boy he once loved.

268
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,400
He also said he exchanged diaries with him.

269
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,240
Being somebody's replacement never bothered me, though.

270
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,600
Mr. Aoyama!

271
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,160
Mr. Aoyama!

272
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,845
Mr. Aoyama!

273
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,830
Mr. Aoyama!

274
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,685
Mr. Aoyama and I had sex many times.

275
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,210
Each time we did it,
I fell more in love with him.

276
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,634
He also told me he loved me too.

277
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,410
But, one day,

278
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:57,580
he told me he wanted to introduce me to someone,
and took me to meet Shibahara.

279
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,450
Aoyama has sold you to me.

280
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,890
The man is nothing but a fool.

281
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,770
He's still infatuated with the brat
who destroyed his social standing.

282
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,090
Knowing this, you still have feelings for Aoyama?

283
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,960
I'd do anything for him!

284
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,445
You like that, Ruka?

285
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,980
Feels good, right?

286
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,348
The body never lies.

287
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,570
No matter how much you love Aoyama,

288
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,170
my mouth has made you hard as a rock.

289
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,610
Your stomach looks like it's gonna burst!

290
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,650
Shibahara told me everything.

291
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,820
From Mr. Aoyama getting sued by his student,
to losing his teaching job.

292
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,630
As well as the fact that
he never gave up on his student.

293
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,497
He also told me Mr. Aoyama devised a plan
using his connections in the underworld

294
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:36,000
to get his beloved student back in his arms.

295
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,194
When did you find out that student was me?

296
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,840
Only recently.

297
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,057
Knowing he loved you that much,

298
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,268
really made me envious of you.

299
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,120
Ruka.

300
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,730
It must have been tough for you.

301
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,640
Haruto...

302
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,011
What?

303
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,010
Mr. Aoyama kissed these lips too, huh?

304
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,640
Allow me to take his place.

305
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,548
You're different from the last guy.

306
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,634
I'm the owner of this club.

307
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,550
I know it's sudden,
but you already have requests.

308
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,690
Already? Wow, that's fast!

309
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,030
Indeed.

310
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:13,760
Our clients are always excited
when a cute, young boy starts.

311
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,620
That's great! I'm gonna work hard
and make my boyfriend happy!

312
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,754
Since it's your first gig, I'll introduce
you to my most trusted client.

313
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,100
Haruto, that feels nice.

314
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,720
Haruto...

315
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,860
I don't have a cock.

316
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,580
Shibahara told me.

317
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,690
I don't have one, either.

318
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,740
Yeah, I know.

319
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,250
Haruto!

320
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,580
That's the spot!

321
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,920
Yeah, right there!

322
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,240
It feels too good!

323
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,340
I'm Takumi. Nice to meet you!

324
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,290
Ditto.

325
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,010
I'm Akira.

326
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,620
Wow, I've never had a threesome before!

327
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,840
I'll go take a shower.

328
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,960
Now it's my turn to make you feel good.

329
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,810
What's that?

330
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,110
Shibahara gave it to me.

331
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,530
It's made of a special metal
with high thermal conductivity,

332
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,570
and is designed to convey
each other's body temperature.

333
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,708
It's really warm inside you.

334
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,600
You feel warm too!

335
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,445
Haruto, you slept with Shibahara, didn't you?

336
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,970
He paid me to do it.

337
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,430
Haruto!

338
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,610
Haruto!

339
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,540
Haruto!

340
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,960
Don't stop!

341
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:08,250
Knock it off! I'm not joking around,
you're gonna rip my nipple off!

342
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,460
I'm being serious! Please, let go already!!

343
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:19,680
What are you playing at?

344
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,790
Where's the brat?

345
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,290
In the shower room.

346
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,770
Spit it out.

347
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,600
What's Seiya up to?

348
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,800
Is he after revenge?

349
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,280
Or is he trying to steal back the money?

350
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,050
If you don't wanna die,
I suggest telling me everything.

351
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,860
What are Seiya and Yazaki planning to do?

352
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,280
Yazaki?

353
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,045
Who's that?

354
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,908
You don't know?

355
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,610
You were right.

356
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,460
We should've killed them both
when we had the chance.

357
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,350
Send the kid to Yazaki.
This will be my final warning.

358
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,770
I was always envious of

359
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,590
the last man Mr. Aoyama loved.

360
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:04,430
But, when I first laid eyes on you,

361
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,970
those feelings of jealousy vanished.

362
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:11,150
I was more interested in sleeping with you.

363
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:17,290
While doing it with you, I felt I could finally
forget my feelings for Mr. Aoyama.

364
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,290
Likewise.

365
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,950
Sleeping with you made me forget about him too.

366
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,860
Haruto, I have a favor to ask.

367
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,970
What is it?

368
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,360
I want you to help me with a plan.

369
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,160
A plan?

370
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,270
Yeah. I'm gonna kill Shibahara.

371
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,120
What?

372
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,450
That bastard killed Mr. Aoyama.

373
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,925
You hate him enough to kill him too, right?

374
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,102
I've imagined doing it so many times.

375
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,740
But I've never had the courage to do it alone.

376
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,500
He's backed by a powerful organization, after all.

377
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,080
But after meeting you,
I feel I can pull it off.

378
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,250
Ruka!

379
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,690
Are you being serious?

380
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,650
Don't worry. I'll be the one who kills him.

381
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,930
Once he's dead,
we'll steal the money from his safe.

382
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,350
That's where I need your help.

383
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,900
You don't anything to worry about.

384
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,880
It's Mr. Aoyama's money in the first place.

385
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,971
Once we take it,
let's divide it up and run away.

386
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,228
If we don't kill Shibahara, we'll
always be forced to live as his slaves.

387
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,550
Is that what you want?

388
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,537
Shibahara made this for me
should I ever find myself in trouble.

389
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,000
I'll use it to kill him.

390
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,940
When Mr. Aoyama died,

391
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,900
my heart died with him.

392
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:46,840
But now I've met you,
I feel like I wanna live once again.

393
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,980
So, Ruka...

394
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,314
Don't go through with this!

395
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,010
Killing Shibahara won't bring Mr. Aoyama back!

396
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,537
But...!

397
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:08,190
Besides, even if you kill Shibahara,
you'll never escape the clutches of the organization!

398
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,010
So, you're happy to go on like this!?

399
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,080
We don't have any other choice.

400
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:30,354
But I know that as long as I have you,
we'll get through this somehow.

401
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,890
Okay, I understand.

402
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,980
Seiya.

403
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:48,590
Shouldn't you be getting back to your lover?

404
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,960
Gimme 10 more minutes.

405
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,310
Besides, he ain't my lover. He's my income.

406
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,770
Mr. Yazaki! We have a delivery from Mr. Shibahara!

407
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,060
We'll leave it here!

408
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,040
Where you going!? This way!

409
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,140
- Seiya!
- Keep your voice down.

410
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,690
Takumi?

411
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,330
- What was it?
- Call an ambulance.

412
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:07,400
What?

413
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,560
Somebody's collapsed outside.

414
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,771
What do you mean?

415
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,630
Mr. Yazaki.

416
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,210
I need to borrow something.

417
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,720
What are you up to?

418
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,400
Seiya, what do you need that for!?

419
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,090
Mr. Yazaki.

420
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,940
I promise I'll return.

421
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:38,140
Seiya!

422
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,450
Haruto...

423
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,660
Forgive me.

424
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,011
Mr. Shibahara.

425
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,091
What are you doing here?
I told you to keep away.

426
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,780
I wanted to see you again.

427
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,500
Relax.

428
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:03,600
I took care of your fuck-up.
Your secret is safe.

429
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,320
Thank you.

430
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,830
I knew I could count on you.

431
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,790
Ruka?

432
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,880
I heard.

433
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:24,840
You slept with Haruto, didn't you?

434
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,170
What if I did?

435
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,550
You're not jealous, are you?

436
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,450
Yes, I am.

437
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,040
I always hated you, but

438
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,330
when I heard you did it with Haruto,
I suddenly felt really frustrated.

439
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,290
Ruka...

440
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,620
Mr. Shibahara, tell me...

441
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,630
Do you still love me?

442
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,820
Yeah.

443
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,040
Then make love to me.

444
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,750
Right now?

445
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,420
Yeah.

446
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,640
I'll use your gift to make you feel good.

447
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,320
Ruka...

448
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,950
What are you up to?

449
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,420
Oh? What do you mean?

450
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:34,308
Don't go anywhere.

451
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,440
Hey, who's there?

452
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,280
Get the fuck off my premises!

453
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,340
Hey!

454
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,050
Quit hiding!

455
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,570
Whoah! Stop!

456
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,485
This is for Takumi and Yazaki.

457
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,000
Shibahara's death
was never reported in the news.

458
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,931
No doubt somebody
in the organization covered it up.

459
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,680
I guess this is "Rakka-Ryusui"?

460
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,660
Mr. Aoyama explained it.

461
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,130
"Rakka-Ryusui" also means
- when two people's feelings align

462
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,920
and they enter a state of mutual love.

463
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,020
There's something that I must tell you.

464
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,860
What is it?

465
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,800
It wasn't Shibahara who killed Mr. Aoyama.

466
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,900
What do you mean?

467
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,370
Ruka.

468
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,290
I brought Aoyama here as you wished.

469
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,140
Did you intend on using me from the start?

470
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:58,760
I even mutilated my body for you!

471
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Don't look away!

472
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,900
That's when he told me:

473
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:20,420
"I don't care what happens to me,
but please don't hurt Haruto."

474
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,760
His words shocked me to my core.

475
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,020
Ruka, now do you see?

476
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:32,220
Aoyama never gave a shit about you.

477
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:37,290
He just used you to
get closer to another man.

478
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,154
Mr. Aoyama, is that true?

479
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:53,200
Even if it is, I'll still always love you.

480
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,730
Ruka...

481
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,890
Thank you.

482
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,440
Mr. Aoyama...

483
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,570
Let's make love.

484
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,010
Mr. Aoyama...

485
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,760
I'll use this to

486
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,085
send you to heaven.

487
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,060
It was me who killed Mr. Aoyama.

488
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,530
Why tell me that now!?

489
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,370
If you kept quiet,
I'd never have found out!

490
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,590
Because I no longer have any regrets.

491
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,720
I doubt you've noticed, but

492
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,020
I've loved you for the longest time.

493
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,670
When I was bullied at high school,

494
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,870
you were the only thing
I had to keep me going.

495
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,190
I can't wait to read it.

496
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:48,940
It's nothing special.

497
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,280
But when I found out that you and Mr. Aoyama
were in an intimate relationship,

498
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,470
I quit school out of shock.

499
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,740
Not long after that, Mr. Aoyama quit too.

500
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:12,822
I managed to track
- him down and hire him as my home tutor.

501
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,230
I figured I could get him to reveal
some kind of information about you.

502
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:25,220
I'd do anything for him!

503
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:30,610
I acted like Mr. Aoyama
was taking advantage of me,

504
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,700
but in truth, I was actually using him.

505
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,050
All in the hope of finding you.

506
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,885
Then, when he was no longer useful, I killed him.

507
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:48,080
Allow me to take his place.

508
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,720
I took a pretty roundabout way, but

509
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,828
it was all so we could be together like this.

510
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:03,340
Now I've finally made my dream come true.

511
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,710
That's why I no longer have any regrets.

512
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:12,050
I killed Mr. Aoyama,

513
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,530
so I don't mind if you kill me in return.

514
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,850
Kill me using this.

515
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,800
Ruka!

516
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,890
That's enough!

517
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:36,760
I forgive you!

518
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:41,730
Haruto, give it to me.

519
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,520
Haruto! Oh, Haruto!

520
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,822
I still see Mr. Aoyama in my dreams each night.

521
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,890
That's why I still write to him in my diary.

522
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,490
Mr. Aoyama!

523
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:02,130
Mr. Aoyama, I will always love you...

524
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,960
Because your heart forever belongs to me.
