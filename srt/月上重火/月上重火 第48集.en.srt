00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 48

4
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,000
Xue Lie,

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
isn’t it enough that you killed Muyuan?

6
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
Will you stigmatize him?

7
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,880
Chong Xuezhi.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,720
Do you know

9
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,760
how severe the crime

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,740
of slandering a prince is?

11
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Lord Lu,

12
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,680
we stole Black Fires from your mill.

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,520
You asked your men to stop my carriage.

14
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Did they

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
come back?

16
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,160
But don’t worry.

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
They are still alive.

18
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,440
They were sent to Dongdu.

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
Though you did a lot of favor to them,

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,960
once they were put in prison,

21
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,560
they talked

22
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
They told everything

23
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,600
My men?

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,180
I don’t know what you mean.

25
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,020
Shangguan Tou,

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,280
don’t slander me.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,040
I don’t have those men.

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,160
I slander you?

29
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,660
Besides those men,

30
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,420
I have other evidence.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
This is the formula of Black Fires

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,320
that Yuwen Muyuan wrote for you.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,050
Comparing the formula with your Black Fires,

34
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,800
you’ll know whether I’m slandering you.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Why are you laughing?

36
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,840
You are so naive.

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Who am I?

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,640
I am the emperor’s son,

39
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,440
the Crown Prince’s brother.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Does it matter

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
that I manage the martial arts world

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
for my father and brother?

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Does it matter

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,400
that I made

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,520
Black Fires?

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Is it enough?

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,220
Your Highness.

48
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,520
Move back!

49
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,079
Will you assassin me?

50
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,680
Seize him!

51
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,640
Your Highness!

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,500
Your Highness!

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,060
Your Highness!

54
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,370
They want to kill me.

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,810
They are rebelling!

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,720
Seize them.

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,200
Seize them!

58
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
Lie.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,860
That’s enough.

60
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,920
I have known

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,120
everything that you did.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,330
Go to Dongdu with me.

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
Wait for our father’s punishment.

64
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,560
Could you?

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,360
No. I don’t go.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
I don’t go.

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
When will you stop?

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Haven't you realized your mistake?

69
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,440
Brother,

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
you think I’m wrong?

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
I’m wrong?

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
I’m right!

73
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
They are wrong!

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,720
They are wrong!

75
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,160
A'li

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,620
I’m not talking nonsense.

78
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
I’m not.

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
I’m not!

80
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,120
They are wrong.

81
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,360
You are.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,520
You are.

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
You are!

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,560
And you!

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
You pushed me to do this.

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,400
When did I push you?

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,740
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

88
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:54,760

90

Calm down.

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,450
Put down your knife.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,200
Go back to Dongdu with me.

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,360
I won’t.

94
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,080
Our father will listen to your explanation.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
I won’t.

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
I won’t go back!

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Move back!

I am here.

Come.

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,000

Listen.

128
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,090

Go back to Dongdu?

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,920
Why?

137
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
A country has its law,

138
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,320
and a family has its rule.

him well.

169

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,120
He

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,560
pretended to submit to enemies.

184
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,480
But in fact,

185
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,580
he did so to expose Xue Lie’s plot.

186
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,840
Also,

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
he

188
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,240
killed

189
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,000
Fong Mo, Xue Lie’s jackal.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,120
When Xia Qingmei was slaughtering
the martial artists,

191
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Muyuan

192
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,640
sent the message to Master Shangguan secretly.

193
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
He bore all the misunderstandings,

194
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,120
but...

195
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
But he didn’t have a good ending.

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,680
So,

197
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,680
I sincerely

198
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
apologize to Hall of Flames.

199
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,340
Your Highness, thanks for

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,640
clearing Muyuan’s reputation.

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,280
His Highness’s order.

202
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
From today,

203
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
the Sects Alliance is dismissed.

204
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
In the future,

205
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,720
no one is allowed to

206
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
interfere with the sects for any reason.

207
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,240
It is hoped that all leaders recover soon

208
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,720
and regain the spirit of your sects.

209
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,120
Develop your martial arts and characters,

210
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,540
making our Chinese martial arts greater

211
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,120
and passing it from generation to generation.

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,000
That’s all.

213
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
Yes, Your Highness.

214
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,340
Everybody,

215
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,200
no need to bow.

216
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,300
Master Shangguan.

217
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,640
Miss Chong.

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,660
Can I talk with you at somewhere else?

219
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
These days,

220
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,930
we’ve searched Lie’s mansion.

221
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,530
We found this by chance.

222
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,740
[Nine Moves of Lotus God]

223
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,290
Nine Moves of Lotus God?

224
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Yes.

225
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,240
I suspected

226
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,280
that Lie got it from Xia Qingmei.

227
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
It belongs to Hall of Flames.

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,530
I should return it to the owner.

229
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,560
Your Highness, you said

230
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,900
that it belongs to Hall of Flames.

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Can I do

232
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,880
whatever I want with it?

233
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,200
Of course.

234
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Fine.

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,920
Miss Chong.

236
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,800
What do you mean?

237
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
Nine Moves

238
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,320
brought many wars to this world.

239
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
From now on,

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Nine Moves will disappear.

241
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,240
No one will be hurt by it.

242
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,420
I’m surprised.

243
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,480
Miss Chong

244
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
is so brave and generous.

245
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
You are really a heroine.

246
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,500
Master Shangguan,

247
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
you are so lucky.

248
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,880
Yes,

249
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,720
In my life,

250
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,520
meeting Xuezhi

251
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,880
is my luckiest thing.

252
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,520
Your Highness,

253
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
can I ask for one thing?

254
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Please allow me to rebuild Hall of Flames.

255
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,740
Miss Chong.

256
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,680
Stand up.

257
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,290
Please stand up.

258
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,420
Your Highness.

259
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
I beg you to rebuild Hall of Flames, too.

260
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,880
Hall of Flames was

261
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
sealed up wrongly.

262
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,920
Now everything is clear,

263
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,840
so I beg you

264
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,460
to allow Hall of Flames

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
to be revitalized

266
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,570
to protect our country.

267
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
It can make efforts

268
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,640
to enhance our military.

269
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,360
You

270
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,440
just avoided a disaster of martial arts world.

271
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
You also helped me

272
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
to arrest Lie.

273
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,640
To be honest,

274
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,930
I really appreciate your help.

275
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,760
Also,

276
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,810
your every word is sincere.

277
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,920
You think for our country and our people.

278
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
It’s the state’s luck.

279
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,560
But rebuilding Hall of Flames

280
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,800
is a big thing.

281
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,080
I need to escort Lie to Dongdu first.

282
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,220
I’ll talk about the details
after seeing my father.

283
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,040
I don’t know father’s idea now,

284
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,160
but

285
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,920
I swear

286
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,880
I

287
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,560
will try my best.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,330
Thanks, Your Highness.

289
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,160
No worries.

290
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,040
Have a seat.

291
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,760
Sit.

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,920
Look at you.

293
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,680
I took you here

294
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,080
just to

295
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,480
talk with you like friends.

296
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Formality is unnecessary.

297
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,360
But you?

298
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Kneel and appreciate me?

299
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,500
Master Shangguan.

300
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
The case of Imperial Advisor

301
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,960
was investigated again.

302
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,520
If you want to,

303
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
go home to have a look.

304
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,020
All people will die.

305
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,060
Family

306
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,220
will also part.

307
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,370
Everything in the world

308
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,560
has their destiny.

309
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,680
Don’t regret.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,560
Don’t dwell on the past.

311
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
Finish what you are doing.

312
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Let go of all the feuds

313
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,840
and have a good life.

314
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,800
To win the game,

315
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,880
you must find your chess.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,800
Chess?

317
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,530
What’s my chess?

318
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,400
I am

319
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,760
your chess.

320
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,320
Father, thanks for

321
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,720
saving Xuezhi.

322
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,040
I’m not satisfied

323
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
with your appreciation.

324
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,760
I hope you can take her back

325
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,700
and let her thank me in person.

326
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,760
Father.

327
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I am back to see you

328
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
with my loved one.

329
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,560
Xuezhi.

330
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
Her name is Chong Xuezhi.

331
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,180
She’s the only one whom I will love

332
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
for the rest of my life.

333
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,500
Imperial Advisor.

334
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
Don’t worry.

335
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,840
I will stay with Tou

336
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,360
for my life.

337
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,640
I’ll take care of him.

338
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,560
In the future,

339
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,660
Hall of Flames is his home.

340
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,660
What’s the matter?

341
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,180
Will you go back to Hall of Flames?

342
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,360
So where else

343
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,080
can I go?

344
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,760
Tou.

345
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,080
Xuezhi.

346
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,720
Do you remember what you said?

347
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,640
You said

348
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,580
you would go to Moon Valley with me

349
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,520
and stay with Mr. Lin

350
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,890
to live a carefree life.

351
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,060
We will live in seclusion.

352
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,290
Yes, I remember.

353
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,400
But...

354
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,010
But you can’t leave Hall of Flames.

355
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,700
My father fought for Hall of Flames
for his life.

356
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
As the leader,

357
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,560
I can’t just leave it.

358
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,120
Mr. Lin told me

359
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,140
that he’s living in seclusion

360
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
because of his cowardice.

361
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,880
It’s hard for him to put down the obsession.

362
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,760
I didn’t understand

363
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,680
until

364
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,400
my family came down in the world.

365
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,730
My father died wrongly,

366
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,720
and my sister died with hate.

367
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,170
Now, I’ve realized that

368
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,720
everything you have

369
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,200
may disappear

370
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,240
suddenly.

371
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,080
Xuezhi,

372
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,930
I don’t want to lose you.

373
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,560
You won’t lose me.

374
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,700
We can go back to Hall of Flames together.

375
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,960
Go back together?

376
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,400
And then?

377
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,280
And we struggle in

378
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,000
the resentment forever?

379
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,320
Xuezhi,

380
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
after experiencing so much,

381
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,080
I’ve been tired with dramatic

382
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,360
and violent life.

383
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
What I want

384
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
is peaceful and simple

385
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
happiness.

386
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,040
I want to be with you

387
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
forever.

388
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,200
It is also what you want,

389
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,880
isn’t it?

390
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,960
Muyuan

391
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,840
lived for me

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
and Hall of Flames.

393
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,320
When he was dying,

394
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,480
he let me take care of it.

395
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,040
I can’t let him down.

396
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,380
I don’t ask you to let anyone down.

397
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,400
I can go back with you.

398
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,200
And after we settle everything,

399
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,370
we’ll go to Moon Valley.

400
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:43,850
Alright.

401
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
I know

402
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,160
Hall of Flames is important to you.

403
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,200
If you have

404
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
made up your mind,

405
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,160
I won’t force you.

406
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,520
But I hope

407
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,840
you know

408
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
what you want.

409
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,560
I believe Leader Chong Ye

410
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,560
and Muyuan

411
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,960
would want you

412
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
to be happy.

413
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,360
I hope you can understand it.

414
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,600
Fengzi.

415
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,400
Father,

416
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,160
you are pregnant. It’s not safe to sit here.

417
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,520
Go back to your room.

418
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
-It’s okay.
-Go back.

419
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,720
Father.

420
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,520
Do you remember?

421
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
When Qingmei and I were kids,

422
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,880
we always practiced martial arts here.

423
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,800
Then, I thought

424
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,760
he worked very hard,

425
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
so when he grew up,

426
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,200
he would be a hero.

427
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,440
Qingmei was talented

428
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,770
and worked hard.

429
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,920
He was my best student

430
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,200
for all these years.

431
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,700
Father,

432
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,480
do you think

433
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,480
Qingmei has

434
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,760
been a hero

435
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,440
in somewhere?

436
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,360
Of course.

437
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,320
Maybe

438
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
when he’s tired of helping others outside,

439
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,200
he’ll come back.

440
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,440
In your next life,

441
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,960
you should also

442
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,460
marry a man who picks flowers for you.

443
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,000
Leader,

444
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,120
I think after we’re back,

445
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,040
we should rebuild the ancestral hall first.

446
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,360
The place for worship must be clean.

447
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,440
Alright.

448
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,560
And that Blacksmithing Workshop.

449
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,800
We need more tuyeres.

450
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
The temperature is high.

451
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,520
It’s like a stove in summer.

452
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,160
Fine.

453
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,920
Also,

454
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,880
the flowers and grasses in the yard.

455
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
We haven’t taken care of them for long.

456
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,280
They must be dying.

457
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,640
But it doesn’t matter.

458
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Chequ and I

459
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,720
will buy some seeds in Peace County.

460
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,200
Right, Chequ?

461
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,760
Leader.

462
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,000
Chief Guardian told us

463
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
to bring Mr. Yuwen’s body

464
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
to Hall of Flames to bury.

465
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Fine.

466
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Zhusha, Chequ.

467
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,250
I want to go to a place first.

468
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,940
[To Xuezhi]

469
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,400
Xuezhi,

470
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,400
this dress

471
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,280
is for you.

472
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,200
I know you like it so much.

473
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,640
I found it back for you.

474
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,240
When I just arrived at here,

475
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
I hoped

476
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,560
to give you a same red dress

477
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,320
and marry you.

478
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
And then, we would

479
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,290
live a peaceful and happy life.

480
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,080
But now, I know

481
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,400
that you never

482
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
have feeling for me.

483
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,210
Even though I give you
the most pretty wedding dress,

484
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,560
in your eyes,

485
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,140
it’s not better than this worn red dress.

486
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,000
Xuezhi,

487
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,800
I’ll go to lurk around Lord Lu tomorrow.

488
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,780
I don’t know

489
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,640
whether I can come back.

490
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,400
If I’m lucky enough to gain Hall of Flames back,

491
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,880
I’ll give this dress to you in person,

492
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,880
and make your wedding glorious.

493
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,320
Xuezhi,

494
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,880
I want you to

495
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,480
be an ordinary girl

496
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,080
and wear your favorite clothes.

497
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Live with your loved one forever

498
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,560
and always be happy.

499
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,400
Leader.

500
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,960
Zhusha.

501
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
Have a seat.

502
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
I have something to tell you.

503
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,840
Zhusha.

504
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,960
I have decided

505
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,930
not to go back to Hall of Flames.

506
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,920
You don’t go back?

507
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,120
But Leader,

508
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,680
we have been looking forward to

509
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,880
the day that Hall of Flames comes back for long.

510
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
Why don’t you go back?

511
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:43,920
Zhusha.

512
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,920
I begged the Crown Prince

513
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,120
to lift the lockdown of Hall of Flames

514
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,160
not because

515
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,760
I want to be the leader.

516
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,560
But because what Hall of Flames does

517
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,280
is beneficial to the world.

518
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,400
Only when we have strong military,

519
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,920
can we live a happy life.

520
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,720
But Leader.

521
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
How can Hall of Flames exist

522
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
if we don’t have a leader?

523
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,920
You are right.

524
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,400
There must be a leader of Hall of Flames.

525
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,560
But the leader

526
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,240
can be someone else.

527
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,880
I have found

528
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,890
a new capable leader

529
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,200
for Hall of Flames.

530
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,160
Leader.

531
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,320
You...

532
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
You mean me?

533
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,080
Xuezhi.

534
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
My heart

535
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
is for your heart.

536
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,120
I feel what you feel.

537
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,440
You are back.

538
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,290
I couldn’t wait any longer.

539
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,400
Xuezhi,

540
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,440
do you remember you promised

541
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,880
to give me

542
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,800
your most important thing?

543
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
I know what I want now.

544
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,600
What?

545
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,230
I want your rest time.

546
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,080
I want to be a part

547
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,600
Of the rest of your rest life.

548
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,700
Stabilize the ladder.

549
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,920
Wuming.

550
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,640
How’s it going?

551
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
-How’s everything going?
-Mr. Lin.

552
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,920
We made it well here.

553
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,980
We’ve finished it.

554
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,160
Only the backyard hasn’t been decorated.

555
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,920
Good.

556
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,800
This is the first time we hold a happy event.

557
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,360
Yes.

558
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,760
We must decorate it well.

559
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,880
No wonder you didn’t go back to Hall of Flames.

560
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,040
You want to stay here

561
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
to be Mrs. Shangguan.

562
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,740
I always wanted

563
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,200
to experience the martial arts world

564
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,220
and fight for a good place for Hall of Flames.

565
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,920
But then, I found

566
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,200
that it’s not hard to join the world.

567
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,530
The really hard thing is

568
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,400
living a simple

569
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,660
and carefree life.

570
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
How pitiful I am.

571
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,160
I have to manage Hall of Flames alone.

572
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,290
What a tricky issue.

573
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,440
Look at your bad temper.

574
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Chequ’s life is harder.

575
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,280
Look.

576
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,200
Even Hongxiu tells it.

577
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,800
What?

578
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Do you think

579
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,840
the rouge is too red?

580
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,760
It’s almost the time for wedding.

581
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,920
Why don’t you stay with Master Shangguan?

582
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,280
Why did you come here?

583
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,900
The time is enough.

584
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,040
Chequ is with Tou.

585
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,080
There’s nothing that I can help.

586
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,720
Also,

587
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,720
I have something more important to talk to you.

588
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,720
Talk to me?

589
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,610
What’s your good thing?

590
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,440
Come on,

591
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,240
Master Yin.

592
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,320
You are not old,

593
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
but why is your memory so bad?

594
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,640
Have you forgotten the thing I told you before?

595
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,440
What?

596
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,170
I’ve really forgotten.

597
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,440
I told you

598
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,680
to make some herbal medicine for Tou and Xuezhi.

599
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,720
I hope to have a grandchild earlier.

600
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,680
You... You...

601
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,780
How can you speak out those words?

602
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,560
Filthy words.

603
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,440
Why are they filthy words?

604
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,960
How...

605
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,120
How come a physician is so shy?

606
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
I tell you.

607
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
I am a physician, not a midwife.

608
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Giving you a baby is not my business.

609
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
You don’t help me?

610
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,800
Fine, I’ll find medicine for myself.

611
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
It’s not this.

612
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,680
It’s not?

613
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,920
And this.

614
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,200
It’s not this.

615
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,800
Your medicine is not here.

616
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,560
Go away.

617
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,640
Don’t bother me.

618
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
It’s annoying.

619
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,200
You...

620
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,840
Leader.

621
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,800
It’s really good to see

622
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,120
you getting married.

623
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,640
Look at you.

624
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,890
What did you call me?

625
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
You are the leader of Hall of Flames now.

626
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,400
I’m used to it.

627
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
Also, in my heart,

628
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
you are always my leader.

629
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,160
Alright.

630
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,700
It’s time for wedding.

631
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,330
Wear this pair of earrings.

632
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,120
Wait.

633
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,900
These earrings

634
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,280
were prepared by Muyuan.

635
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,850
Do I look pretty?

636
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes.

637
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,400
You are pretty.

638
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
Leader!

639
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
-Leader!
-Chequ.

640
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,880
You can’t go in. What are you doing?

641
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,040
Men can’t come in.

642
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,880
Go out!

643
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,680
Let me finish my words.

644
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,640
Go out!

645
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,320
Stop!

646
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,080
What are you doing?

647
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,410
Shangguan Tou escaped.

648
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,960
Escaped? Where did he go?

649
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,180
I can’t find him in the whole Moon Valley.

650
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,240
Xuezhi!

651
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,200
Leader!

652
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,320
Leader!

653
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,200
Take care.

654
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,320
Xuezhi, take care.

655
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,720
Xuezhi, don’t worry.

656
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
I’ve asked the disciples to find him.

657
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,980
They will find him.

658
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,760
What’s wrong with Tou?

659
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,040
What will he do

660
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,680
on such an important day?

661
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,880
Chequ.

662
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Say it clearly.

663
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,880
What do you mean “Shangguan Tou escaped”?

664
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,080
He will marry Leader today.

665
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,160
Where can he go?

666
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,640
I don’t know.

667
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
Master Shangguan won’t disappear suddenly.

668
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,920
Chequ, think about it.

669
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,160
Did he say anything when he left?

670
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,440
Right.

671
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,120
He said something.

672
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,720
What?

673
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,480
His words are weird.

674
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,120
It’s

675
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,040
like a poem.

676
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,880
What poem?

677
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,040
I can’t remember it clearly.

678
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,120
It’s about trees and flowers...

679
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,800
And marry...

680
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,480
So he should marry first.

681
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,720
Why did he escape?

682
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,120
The peach tree is with luxuriant foliage

683
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,600
and the flowers are lush.

684
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,480
The girl who will marry

685
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,360
will live a happy life.

686
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,760
Yes.

687
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,340
It’s this poem.

688
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,040
I know.

689
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,400
Xuezhi! Xuezhi!

690
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,720
Shangguan Tou!

691
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,960
I know you are here!

692
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,960
Come out!

693
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,440
Shangguan Tou, come out!

694
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,400
Come out!

695
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,560
The peach tree is with luxuriant foliage

696
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,960
and the flowers are lush.

697
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,620
The girl who will marry

698
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
will live a happy life.

699
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,800
Don’t you want to marry me?

700
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
I want to spend such a beautiful time

701
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,920
only with you.

702
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,880
Xuezhi.

703
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,960
I love you.

704
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
I love you, too.
