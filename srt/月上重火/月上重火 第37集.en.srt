[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 37

4
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,550
Fengzi.

5
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,450
I've never been disappointed in you.

6
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,360
And I don't look down on you.

7
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,440
I'm just worried about you.

8
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,240
You've known Shangguan Tou since little.

9
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,550
I've also

10
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,160
known you since childhood.

11
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,190
In my heart,

12
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,440
you are like the peony,

13
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,079
precious and elegant.

14
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,079
I want to take good care of you.

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,720
I don't want you to get hurt.

16
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,250
I don't want you to be upset.

17
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,600
Every word I've ever said

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,880
is serious.

19
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,079
Fengzi.

20
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,650
I want to be the butterfly.

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,390
I want

22
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,200
to be by the side of the peony flower

23
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,320
to accompany you

24
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,520
and take care of you.

25
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Okay?

26
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,360
In my opinion,

27
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,160
our engagement banquet

28
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,630
has never ended.

29
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,110
Aren't you afraid

30
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,940
I'll break our engagement again?

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,110
I’m afraid.

32
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,600
But

33
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,530
I believe in every decision you make.

34
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
Hongxiu.

35
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,720
Xuezhi.

36
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,480
How are you feeling?

37
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,440
Much better.

38
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,550
Hongxiu.

39
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,200
Thank you

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,540
for picking flowers for me every day.

41
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
I can't do anything else,

42
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,510
but picking flowers

43
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,480
is okay.

44
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,159
Come on.

45
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,080
Have some porridge.

46
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,070
Please help me up and go over there.

47
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,640
I want to get up and walk more

48
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
when I can.

49
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,040
No, your physical condition doesn't allow it.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,640
It doesn’t matter.

51
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,830
Take care.

52
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,320
You can only walk in the room.

53
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,430
You shouldn't get up.

54
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,390
I think Tou is coming back.

55
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,230
Take care.

56
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,880
Xuezhi.

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,670
Xuezhi!

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,970
Xuezhi, wake up!

59
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,740
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

60
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,060
Your Highness.

61
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,650
Why are you sleeping in your study again?

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,600
Sir.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,920
Both study and bedroom

64
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,110
are cold rooms.

65
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,550
You came to me so early.

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,320
What's up?

67
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,920
Yuwen Muyuan is outside, asking to see you.

68
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,270
It looks like you won the bet.

69
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
Your Highness, will you see him?

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,110
You can see him on my behalf.

71
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,160
Yes.

72
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,850
Chief Guardian.

73
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,390
His Highness knows that you are here.

74
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,510
So he prepared good tea for you,

75
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,760
which is good for calmness.

76
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
I want to see Lord Lu.

77
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,920
His Highness is on official business.

78
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,320
You can tell me first if you have something,

79
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,110
lest later

80
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,830
you contradict His Highness.

81
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,270
Tell you?

82
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,290
May I make bold to ask

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,200
if you are in charge of Lord Lu’s Mansion now?

84
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,880
Chief Guardian.

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,390
Don’t make such a joke.

86
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,390
Since you are not,

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,970
would you please

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
ask Lord Lu to come out?

89
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,550
If you want to see His Highness,

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,230
there must be a reason.

91
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,010
Make a deal.

92
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,390
That’s okay.

93
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,390
But I wonder what you're offering.

94
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,790
A person.

95
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,640
A sword.

96
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
That's exactly what he said?

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,950
Yes, exactly.

98
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
It seems that he has made up his mind.

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
How does he look?

100
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,659
He looks the same as usual,

101
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,270
nothing special.

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,110
He doesn’t feel anxious. Why should I do?

103
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,320
Let him wait.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,659
When he shows his true colors,

105
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,550
I will talk to him.

106
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,510
He is here.

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
Your Highness will have the final say

108
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
when you see him.

109
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,200
Xuezhi has been in a coma for two days.

110
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,200
Tianling Stone.

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,440
Hongxiu.

112
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,420
I'm going to treat her.

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm afraid I have to use your yard.

114
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,370
Your Highness.

115
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,870
It's almost the time.

116
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,320
He is tired.

117
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,910
Alright.

118
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,250
Chief Guardian.

119
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,520
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

120
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,910
Pay respects to Your Highness.

121
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,570
Have a seat.

122
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,990
You are my honored guest.

123
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,230
It’s unnecessary to stand on ceremony.

124
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,110
I'm tied up with

125
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,030
a lot of things today.

126
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,640
Thanks for waiting for me.

127
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,080
Your Highness.

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,320
I have something important to discuss with you.

129
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,590
I'll get straight to the point.

130
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,110
Okay.

131
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,590
I like a straight talker.

132
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,880
I

133
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
would like to help Your Highness

134
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,570
establish the Sects Alliance.

135
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,010
Chief Guardian.

136
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,630
When you were Chief Guardian of Hall of Flames,

137
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,640
I invited you,

138
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,370
but you refused.

139
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,550
Later when Hall of Flames was sealed up,

140
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,200
I invited you again,

141
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,610
but you still refused.

142
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,910
Why do you suddenly change your mind?

143
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,280
I grew up in the martial arts world.

144
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,740
I thought I knew the fickleness of the world.

145
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,960
But the escape

146
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,960
really made me

147
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,700
realize the fickleness of the world.

148
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,550
Last time,

149
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,350
I acted on impulse

150
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,370
and refused Your Highness.

151
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,820
Then I went back and thought about it.

152
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,550
Your Highness is noble and

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,670
has no grudge against the martial arts world.

154
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,350
If you want to establish the Sects Alliance,

155
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,210
you naturally want to benefit it.

156
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,080
You think it through.

157
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,790
Since you’d like to help me,

158
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,910
I

159
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,880
have to repay you.

160
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,590
I wonder what you want.

161
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,790
I'm selfish.

162
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,350
I hope you can help me revive Hall of Flames.

163
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,080
You’ve spent all your energies on it
these years.

164
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,110
It's human nature

165
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,000
for you to be selfish.

166
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,520
I just don't know,

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
after the revival of Hall of Flames,

168
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,350
what's

169
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
your plan?

170
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,230
Call back disciples
to revive the Hall of Flames

171
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,760
and work for Your Highness.

172
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Good.

173
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,200
With your help,

174
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,670
I will

175
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,790
be more powerful.

176
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,110
But I wonder

177
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,550
what else you want.

178
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,400
I will make bold.

179
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
I heard that Your Highness's foreign warriors

180
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,230
have a special martial arts skill,

181
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,400
called Wuse Skill.

182
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,910
I want an antidote.

183
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,760
For Leader Chong?

184
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,520
Yes.

185
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,670
You just said with certainty

186
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,910
that you wanted to revive Hall of Flames.

187
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,030
Why do you suddenly change to

188
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,880
want an antidote for Leader Chong?

189
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,490
After all, Xuezhi and I

190
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,350
grew up together.

191
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,760
Now her life is in danger.

192
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,710
In public,

193
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,640
she is the Leader and I’m a guardian.

194
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I have to save her.

195
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,350
In private,

196
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,880
I want to

197
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,170
make a last try for myself.

198
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,710
Good.

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,250
Chief Guardian.

200
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
Your sincerity is touching.

201
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,880
But Leader Chong

202
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,280
and Shangguan Tou

203
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,400
have a feeling of life and death.

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
Let me ask you one more question.

205
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,640
If you succeed,

206
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,130
what will you do?

207
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,110
If you fail,

208
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,280
what will you do?

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,790
If I succeed,

210
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,440
my wife and I will work together for you.

211
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,550
If I fail,

212
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,350
I'll break off all relations with her.

213
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,410
When we meet again,

214
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,110
we are strangers.

215
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,760
Good.

216
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,350
You are a straightforward person.

217
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,550
I like it.

218
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,130
I'll give you

219
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,640
the antidote.

220
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,230
What?

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
You don’t trust me?

222
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,340
But there is only one bottle of antidote.

223
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,760
If I try it,

224
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,320
Leader Chong will have nothing.

225
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,810
Thank you, Your Highness.

226
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,400
Don't be too polite.

227
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,560
I have a word to tell you.

228
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,400
You must remember it.

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,790
Now,

230
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,750
the only person you can trust

231
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
and rely on

232
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,200
is me.

233
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,670
I see.

234
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,810
Tianling Stone really works.

235
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,440
Xuezhi's pulse

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,550
is not as weak as before.

237
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,850
It will take some time for her to recover,

238
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,710
but

239
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,150
she is out of danger now.

240
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,400
Tou.

241
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,880
Are you okay?

242
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,020
If you treat her with Tianling Stone,

243
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,740
your inner strength will be severely depleted,

244
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,030
which cannot be recovered in a short time.

245
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,830
So you can’t act precipitately.

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,670
I'm okay.

247
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,090
I'm just a little tired.

248
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,130
You'd better go get some rest.

249
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,840
You’ve been rushed about for so many days

250
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,400
and treated Xuezhi overnight.

251
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
You must be tired.

252
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Take care of yourself.

253
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,350
Otherwise, when she gets better,

254
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,480
you might collapse.

255
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,960
It will be dawn in a few hours.

256
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,300
I have one more thing to do.

257
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,740
I know what you're going to do.

258
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,340
You just came back.

259
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,440
Let me do it for you.

260
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,720
When Xuezhi wakes up,

261
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,200
you can do it every day.

262
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,470
I must do it myself.

263
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,400
Because

264
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,560
when she wakes up, I hope she’ll see

265
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,760
my sincerity at first sight.

266
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,349
Sir.

267
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,950
Where are the disciples of Hall of Flames?

268
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,230
Since Hall of Flames was sealed up,

269
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,319
its disciples

270
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,950
have made their own living.

271
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,520
Go to

272
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,070
find back all the disciples you can.

273
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,040
Tell them Yuwen Muyuan ordered

274
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,070
to revive Hall of Flames.

275
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,260
Your Highness.

276
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,640
Do you really trust Yuwen Muyuan?

277
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,940
You think Yuwen Muyuan really trusts me?

278
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,160
We're just making a deal.

279
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,560
Just Hall of Flames,

280
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,070
I can afford it.

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,460
Why did Your Highness give him the antidote?

282
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,950
If he saves Chong Xuezhi,

283
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,350
you will have a strong enemy.

284
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,040
How about finding someone to follow Yuwen Muyuan

285
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,830
and looking for a chance

286
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,560
to kill her.

287
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Sir.

288
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,150
You've worked for me for so long.

289
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,560
Have you heard that there is an antidote?

290
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,090
Your Highness,

291
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,670
aren't you afraid he'll know the truth?

292
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,190
Chong Xuezhi is a dying person.

293
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,110
And she is with Shangguan Tou now.

294
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,560
Even if they have the antidote,

295
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,230
they won't believe it

296
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,110
and take it immediately.

297
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,470
When I gave him the antidote,

298
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,930
Yuwen Muyuan would undo the knot in his mind.

299
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
Whether Chong Xuezhi

300
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,680
is dead or alive, takes it or not,

301
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,400
and how she will be after taking it,

302
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,730
these are what Shangguan Tou should face.

303
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,370
They have nothing to do with us.

304
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,430
I just wait for Yuwen Muyuan to come back

305
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,830
and work for me.

306
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,560
Your Highness,

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,330
it’s really a good move.

308
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,510
Since he asked for the antidote,

309
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,000
I just gave it to him.

310
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,400
If he wants to give up,

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,590
I'll help him.

312
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,040
Xuezhi.

313
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,560
Wake up.

314
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,810
Your Highness.

315
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,110
The Warriors in Black spying on various sects

316
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,660
have found something.

317
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,680
Xia Qingmei of Sword Manor

318
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,830
is secretly practicing the Nine Moves.

319
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,710
Really?

320
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,520
Yes.

321
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,560
And what a coincidence.

322
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,680
Your Highness asked

323
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,500
to call back the disciples of Hall of Flames.

324
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,800
Mr. Lin of Sword Manor

325
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,460
has done it for Your Highness.

326
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,800
That’s good.

327
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,040
Then I

328
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,920
should find a chance

329
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,680
to visit him.

330
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,310
Fengzi.

331
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,070
Father.

332
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,800
Why are you here?

333
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,730
Please come in, come in.

334
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,190
Father, have a seat.

335
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,680
Okay.

336
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,140
Are you embroidering?

337
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,760
It looks very good.

338
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,430
Father.

339
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
You’re not here

340
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,920
for my embroidery, are you?

341
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,350
Fengzi.

342
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,650
Do you really decide to marry Qingmei?

343
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,470
Father.

344
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,710
Didn't you

345
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,520
always wish I could marry him?

346
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,000
Now I've decided to marry him,

347
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,470
but why do you hesitate instead?

348
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm not hesitating.

349
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,000
After all this,

350
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,110
I know many things can't be forced,

351
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,470
especially feelings.

352
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,640
I don't want you to marry him

353
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,160
because of me.

354
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,830
Father.

355
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,560
It’s not because of you.

356
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,590
I decided to marry him because I knew

357
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,470
he’s a man worthy of trust.

358
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,760
And you also said that

359
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,430
after all this,

360
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,680
many things can't be forced.

361
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,000
Actually I've been importunate,

362
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,430
which made Shangguan Tou,

363
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,880
Qingmei and I all unhappy.

364
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,430
I'm really glad

365
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,230
you can think so.

366
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
For so many years,

367
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,980
Qingmei has always accompanying me.

368
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,710
When I was sad,

369
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,800
he stayed with me.

370
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,670
Even when I broke off our engagement in public,

371
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,310
he never blamed me.

372
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,430
I can't let him down.

373
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,070
Fengzi.

374
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,760
You've grown up.

375
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,670
You can see the good in others

376
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,090
and are willing to think of others.

377
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,160
That's because

378
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,800
I don't want to repeat master's mistakes.

379
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,140
She loved the wrong person

380
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,890
and ruined her life.

381
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,430
Don't mention it.

382
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,610
Let bygones

383
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,760
be bygones.

384
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:04,650
Father.

385
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,190
Now I've decided to marry Qingmei.

386
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,390
You don't have to worry about me.

387
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,230
Fengzi, try

388
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
some fresh cakes.

389
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,310
Master.

390
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,450
Qingmei.

391
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,900
Come here and sit down.

392
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,810
I just talked to Fengzi about your marriage.

393
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,700
Master, you can rest assured.

394
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,760
All my life,

395
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,870
I will treat Fengzi well.

396
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,190
Qingmei.

397
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
I watched you grow up.

398
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You're talented.

399
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
Over the years,

400
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,230
I've seen your feelings for Fengzi.

401
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,560
In my heart,

402
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,560
you are the best choice for my son-in-law.

403
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,760
Since

404
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,800
you love each other,

405
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,110
you must cherish each other.

406
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,430
In my life,

407
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,160
two things matter most.

408
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,640
One is Sword Manor,

409
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,800
and the other is Fengzi.

410
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,160
Now,

411
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,760
I will trust you with Fengzi.

412
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,680
In the future,

413
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,920
Sword Manor will be taken over by you.

414
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I hope you won't let me down.

415
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,130
Master, you can rest assured.

416
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,410
As the Chief Disciple of Sword Manor,

417
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,230
my duty is to maintain its reputation.

418
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,640
As Fengzi's future husband,

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,000
I will treat her well,

420
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,640
love her,

421
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,960
and take care of her.

422
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,550
Master, I won't let you down.

423
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,520
Good.

424
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,640
But I can’t hold

425
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,490
a grand wedding for you.

426
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,850
The disciples of Hall of Flames hide here.

427
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,640
If there are too many guests,

428
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
the news may leak out.

429
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,620
If it is disclosed,

430
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,550
I’m afraid it will bring disaster to us.

431
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,800
Master.

432
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,110
Fengzi promising to marry me

433
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
is the greatest blessing in my life.

434
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,760
Gossip is a fearful thing.

435
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,470
Moreover,

436
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,400
there is some gossip

437
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
about the engagement banquet last time.

438
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,460
I don't want Fengzi to see them again.

439
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,770
What's more,

440
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,880
the safety of the disciples of Hall of Flames

441
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,080
is more important than the empty forms.

442
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,880
So I decided to

443
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,070
keep everything simple

444
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,880
this time,

445
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,930
without invitations or banquets.

446
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Master, what do you think?

447
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,710
Good.

448
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,370
You can consider this for Fengzi
and Sword Manor,

449
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,670
I feel very relieved.

450
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,680
I am about to marry Fengzi.

451
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,220
I should put her first in everything.

452
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,590
But in doing so,

453
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,360
it will inevitably be unfair to Fengzi.

454
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,060
Never mind.

455
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
As long as my father can stay with me

456
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,400
and watch me get married,

457
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,530
I will be satisfied.

458
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,590
Good. Good.

459
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,110
Sir.

460
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,880
Sir.

461
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,880
I’m here.

462
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,320
There you are.

463
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,160
Sir.

464
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,200
I brought you some cakes.

465
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,350
Alright.

466
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,760
Have a try.

467
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,370
Jujube cake.

468
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,880
I haven't had cakes for a long time.

469
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,880
The cakes

470
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,240
have other meanings, right?

471
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,160
No.

472
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,920
Why do you ask?

473
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,400
Are you getting married?

474
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,330
They’re from the guest.

475
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,830
Liar.

476
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,690
They’re for the wedding, aren’t they?

477
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,470
Right.

478
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,720
I'm getting married

479
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
with Fengzi.

480
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,560
If there had not been the other man,

481
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,960
I would have married her.

482
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,710
Did you forget my warning?

483
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,190
Did you forget my warning?

484
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,280
I didn't.

485
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,120
To practice the Nine Moves,

486
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,000
I must give up feelings and desire for nothing.

487
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
But how is that possible?

488
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,920
How can a man desire for nothing?

489
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,190
You are a monk.

490
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,490
You can't get married.

491
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,230
So you made up lies

492
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,290
to make me believe you, listen to you,

493
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,640
and give up everything for practice,

494
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,590
just like you.

495
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,430
You don't understand what I said.

496
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,880
I didn’t misjudge.

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,920
You are a man of low quality!

498
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,000
All you think about

499
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,640
is the love affairs!

500
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,760
Right.

501
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,890
I am a man of low quality.

502
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,560
Then how about you?

503
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,560
In order to steal the manual,

504
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,710
you played various of small tricks.

505
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,660
You killed innocent people
to whitewash yourself.

506
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,080
You're worse than a man of low quality.

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,640
You only care if I can fulfill

508
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,280
your dream of the Nine Moves,

509
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,920
and don't care if I'm going to be possessed.

510
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,840
They were right to ruin your martial arts skills.

511
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,490
Because people like you

512
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,400
are not qualified to practice the Nine Moves.

513
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,880
You are so selfish.

514
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,290
I'm selfish?

515
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,350
Alright.

516
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
I'll show you something.

517
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,230
See what it is.

518
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,660
The Nine Moves.

519
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,010
Didn't it burn down?

520
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,520
You are so naive.

521
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,810
Such an important manual,

522
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,560
how can I burn it?

523
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,620
The one I burned

524
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,310
was just a forgery.

525
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,520
Stop!

526
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,480
What do you want to do?

527
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,020
I'll burn it right now.

528
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,710
I’ll see how you can be the best in the world.

529
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,040
Monk.

530
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,430
I warn you to put down the manual.

531
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
Or I will…

532
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:07,800
What?

533
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,800
Kill me?

534
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,400
You dare not.

535
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,110
Without me,

536
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,760
you can’t practice the Nine Moves.

537
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,190
Sir.

538
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
Sir, sir!

539
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,260
[Winehouse of Fairyland]

540
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,000
Xuezhi.

541
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,640
When will you wake up?

542
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,690
The flowers are in full bloom outside.

543
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,800
Every time I pick flowers for you,

544
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,710
I think that I will show you

545
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,910
all the beautiful flowers in the world.

546
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,710
But you don't wake up.

547
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,150
No matter how the flowers bloom,

548
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,080
they have nothing to do with me.

549
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Have a good rest.

550
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,460
It’s early to see the flowers.

551
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,950
I want to get some more sleep,

552
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,040
can’t I?

553
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:36,950
Xuezhi.

554
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,160
Xuezhi.

555
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,990
You’re awake.

556
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,230
Tou.

557
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,340
Thank you for saving me again.

558
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,640
Great.

559
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,770
You finally woke up.

560
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,920
Hongxiu.

561
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,360
Thanks for your care.

562
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,700
No need to thank me.

563
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,920
If you want to say thanks,

564
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,280
say it to Tou.

565
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,230
Tou,

566
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,560
where did you find the highly skilled physician?

567
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,800
He even could cure my illness.

568
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,470
He is from the foreign state…

569
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,730
It's not the physician

570
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,090
who cured your illness,

571
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,960
but the Tianling Stone of Swallow Sect.

572
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:47,000
I…

573
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,310
Fengzi.

574
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,060
As long as you give me the Tianling Stone,

575
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,590
I'll do anything you want.

576
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,830
Can you give me a hug?

577
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,150
What else?

578
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,800
Will

579
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,190
you

580
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,630
marry me?

581
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,000
Fengzi.

582
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
I never

583
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,800
compared you to Xuezhi.

584
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,320
You'll never be

585
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,360
the same to me.

586
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:51,909
But if

587
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,630
marrying you

588
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,280
will save Xuezhi,

589
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,470
then I will.

590
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,600
I got it from Fengzi.

591
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,630
Tou,

592
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,280
thank you.

593
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,670
Xuezhi.

594
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,710
I've sent a letter

595
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,910
to Mr. Lin about your recovery,

596
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,840
so that he’ll stop worrying about you.

597
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,630
That's thoughtful of you.

598
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,560
If uncle knows you saved me again,

599
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,000
he will be grateful to you.

600
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:42,950
Xuezhi.

601
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,120
All I did

602
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,860
was what I wanted to do.

603
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,800
If I did nothing

604
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,360
but watch you die,

605
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,670
I would never be at ease.

606
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,630
Tou.

607
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,120
Thank you.

608
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,230
Xuezhi.

609
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,190
In the future,

610
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,150
don't say “thank you” to me again.

611
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,520
Between us,

612
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,840
there's no need to say thank you.

613
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,950
It's so late. Who is it?

614
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,970
Chief Guardian.

615
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,040
How did you find us?

616
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,280
Please come in, come in.

617
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,070
Chief Guardian, have a seat.

618
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,600
Zhusha, don’t bother.

619
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,210
Chief Guardian.

620
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,800
You've lost weight.

621
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,800
I miss you so much.

622
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,190
How are you doing?

623
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,950
Is Leader alright?

624
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,040
She is fine.

625
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,730
Don’t worry.

626
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,710
I'm here today

627
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,610
to see Chequ for something.

628
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,920
Can you step aside for a moment?

629
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,230
Okay.

630
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,520
Sit down.

631
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,010
Chief Guardian.

632
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,640
Have some water.

633
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,870
Chequ.

634
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,450
How are you doing

635
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,670
these days?

636
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,420
We’re fine.

637
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,980
After that day,

638
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,690
Mr. Lin of Sword Manor found Zhusha and me.

639
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,910
Now we have gathered most of our disciples

640
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,360
at Sword Manor.

641
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,230
It's hard for you.

642
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,430
As for Lin Zongxing,

643
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,430
you can trust him,

644
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,390
but you can’t trust him completely.

645
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,000
Anyhow,

646
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,760
I’ll count on you and Zhusha

647
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,700
to take care of our disciples.

648
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,130
Chief Guardian, you can rest assured.

649
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,060
Xuezhi, your skills have further improved.

650
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,870
After experiencing these things,

651
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,400
I suddenly understood that

652
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,390
playing an instrument
depends not only on skills,

653
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,320
but also on the inner feelings of the performer.

654
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,710
Tou.

655
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,710
Hongxiu told me that

656
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,390
if I die,

657
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,600
you will die with me.

658
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,360
Is it true?

659
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,390
It’s true.

660
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,190
Xuezhi.

661
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,430
If you die,

662
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,390
I can't find any meaning to live.

663
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,390
You are so worried about me.

664
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,470
How can I leave you alone?

665
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,000
Xuezhi,

666
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:10,600
tell me.

667
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,120
If I were betrayed

668
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,670
and died,

669
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,930
would you avenge my death?

670
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,870
Of course.

671
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,390
I knew you'd say that.

672
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,710
Xuezhi.

673
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,330
I don't want you to do that.

674
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,270
I don't want you to die for me.

675
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,350
Because you have a more important mission.

676
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,980
Do you know?

677
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,390
It doesn't matter if I live or die.

678
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,320
Even if I die,

679
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,150
there will be no change in martial arts world.

680
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,410
But you're different.

681
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,710
You are the daughter of Chong Ye,

682
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,410
and the only one who has mastered Lotus Wing.

683
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,080
Your status matters.

684
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,360
At present,

685
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,520
Lord Lu wants to take the whole world
as his own.

686
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,320
And your mission

687
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,760
is to stop him.

688
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,910
But

689
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,390
on my own,

690
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,430
what can I do?

691
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,190
Even if Hall of Flames can support me,

692
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,800
I can't fight against

693
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,000
Xue Lie's insidious means.

694
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,600
What’s more,

695
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,840
I have nothing but you now.

696
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,390
What can I rely on to stop him?

697
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,800
The whole martial arts world.

698
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,930
Martial arts world?

699
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,360
Tou.

700
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,200
You must not forget that

701
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,280
in the eyes of people in the martial arts world,

702
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,870
I'm a witch with evil practices.

703
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,260
Why would they support me?

704
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,060
Then change their attitude towards you.

705
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,560
Xuezhi.

706
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,870
At present, we

707
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,870
can’t fight against Lord Lu.

708
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,320
Lord Lu wants the whole martial arts world.

709
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,480
We need to unite the whole martial arts world.

710
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,660
What he is doing now

711
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,500
is to get rid of all those who are against him.

712
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,800
When all the people in martial arts world

713
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,870
are against him,

714
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,630
he will lose.

715
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,080
Now we need a thorough plan.

716
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,430
Yes.

717
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,460
[Sword Manor]

718
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:29,670
Master.

719
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,670
Lord Lu is here.

720
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,390
What is he doing here?

721
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,130
Your Highness, I apologize

722
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,670
for not welcoming you.

723
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,760
Uncle.

724
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,950
You are just being polite!

725
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:52,230
I had no time to talk to you in depth last time.

726
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,360
I regret that.

727
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,230
I have learned that Young Hero Xia and Fengzi

728
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,560
are getting married,

729
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,950
so I came here to congratulate them.

730
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,190
I have prepared some gifts.

731
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,910
I

732
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,950
hope you like them.

733
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,390
How can I accept them?

734
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,230
Of course you can.

735
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,670
Since I was a child, I've heard about

736
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,950
your adventures in the martial arts world,

737
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,010
and I've regarded you as a role model.

738
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,670
Now,

739
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,230
Young Hero Xia is famous in the world.

740
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,870
Since he won first prize in the Hero Assembly,

741
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,290
I appreciate him very much.

742
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

743
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,000
Welcome to our manor.

744
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,870
Fengzi and I will call on you
to express gratitude.
