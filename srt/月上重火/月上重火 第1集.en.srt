to teach her a lesson.

176
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,110
But she was speaking for me.

177
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,580
Good.

178
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,580
Food here is as good as ours at home.

179
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,790
Brother Muyuan,

180
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,660
eat up.

181
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,660
Liuli,

182
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,240
tell Zhusha to come in and eat with us.

183
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,940
Young Master,

184
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,400
rules can’t be broken.

185
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,780
Dig in.

Sedan carried by eight people.

189
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,660
Show off!

190
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,860
Divine Spirit Temple is strange.

191
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,260
That sedan is huge!

192
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,180
They have men carry it instead of horses.

193
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,340
Look at their disciples.

194
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,740
They're short and skinny

195
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,670
unlike other martial artists.

196
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,420
Divine Spirit Temple

197
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,580
is a notorious cult.

198
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,580
They're known for making poison

199
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,700
and killing others with it.

200
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,900
They're viperous.

201
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,820
Their leader Man Feiyue

202
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,100
is a woman whose disciples are all men.

203
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,140
She even tests poisons on them,

204
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,800
so she’s condemned by others.

205
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,380
They compare us

206
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,220
to that cult?

207
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,300
How ridiculous!

208
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,340
Carriage!

209
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,420

Chequ is back.

211
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,940
Stop the carriage.

212
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,220
Make a way.

213
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,950
Are you deaf?

214
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,589
Roads are built to park carriages.

215
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,819
Why should I make a way for you?

216
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,780
Cut the crap!

217
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,700
Didn’t you see the flag of our temple?

218
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,660
-Your temple
-Let’s go.

219
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,500
is an infamous cult.

220
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,220
Don’t you know that?

221
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:19,980
Nonsense!

222
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,900
Why am I told

223
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,819
ours is decent

224
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,220
while yours is a cult?

225
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,520
What are you doing?

226
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,860
How dare you hurt our people!

227
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
I’ll make you pay.

228
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,820
Young Master,

229
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,220

turned out to be a pretty chick?

make friends?

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,080
I won’t be friends with cult members.

237
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,740
Young Master,

238
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,700
watch out. They may be after the manual.

239
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,900
Let's go back inside.

240
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,560
Don't move.

241
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,860
You want to steal the manual?

242
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,460
What a joke!

243
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,470
Give me the antidote

if you want to live.

245
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,500
Hurry.

246
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,160
Or it’ll be too late

247
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,460
to regret.

248
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,460
Fine.

249
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,780
I’ll give it to you.

You’re awake, Miss.

Don't move.

or help me?

Do you think

269
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
I mean to help you

270
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,860
or harm you?

271
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,380
I don’t know.

272
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,220
Hey,

273

where’s Paper?

274
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,860
How is he?

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,660
If by Paper

276
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,720
you mean that white horse,

277
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,160
I’m afraid he's already dead.

278
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,700
Dead?

279
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,220
Sir,

280
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,500
can you please take me to him?

281
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,020
He grew up with me.

282
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,750
It was a gift from my father.

283
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,220
Too bad,

284
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,900
I’ve buried him.

285
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,860
buried

286
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,580
You care so much about him.

287
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,000
I don’t think you want him to be left there

288
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,300
and devoured by coyotes and crows.

289
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,940
Thank you, Sir.

290
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,660
Can you do me a favor?

291
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,100
What is it?

292
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,480
This is a whistling arrow.

293
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,620
Can you please fire it?

294
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,180
Once my family sees it, they’ll find me.

295
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,940
I’m willing to help

296
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,020
but you probably don’t know

297
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,820
we’re in a cave.

298
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,060
It's raining outside.

299
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,300
Even if the rain

300
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,260
didn’t damp your arrow,

301
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,060
the woods would block it.

302
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,060
Why don’t you wait till the rain stops?

303
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
What do you think?

304
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,340
Young Master and Chief Guardian
have left for so long.

305
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,740
Why aren’t they back yet?

306
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,440
Did something happen to them?

307
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,580
Let’s go find them.

308
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,300
No.

309
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,640
No one is allowed to leave.

310
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,220
Chief Guardian asked us to wait at the inn.

311
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,460
If we leave but don’t find them

312
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,660
and we get separated,

313
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,230
it’ll be more troublesome.

314
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,840
But it's already late.

315
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,420
Just stay and wait.

316
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,860
Sir,

317
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,380
what time is it?

318
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,540
About 9 pm.

319
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,700
Already?

320
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,620
Here. Have some water.

321
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,780
May I ask

322
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,180
where you're going next

323
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,220
so that I can repay you for your kindness later?

324
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,980
Repay me?

325
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,540
That’s unnecessary.

326
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,840
As for where I’m going,

327
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,100
I’m going to protect someone.

328
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,180
Protect someone?

329
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,260
That person

330
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,700
must mean a lot to you.

331
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,780
I’m not sure

332
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,940
what I should say to that.

333
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,750
By the way, Miss,

334
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,980
when speaking of Paper,

335
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,480
you were so concerned.

336
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
I assume there must be a special bond

337
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,020
between you two.

338
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,100
I've been into horses since I was little.

339
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,060
My father gave Paper to me as a gift.

340
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,460
My elder brother also has one.

341
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,420
Mine is called Paper.

342
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,540
His is called Ink.

343
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,780
We grew up

344
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,980
with them.

345
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,460
So our bond is tighter

346
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,860
than that of others.

347
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,940
You love your horse so much.

348
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,100
I’m sure you love your brother

349
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,780
even deeper.

350
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,100
Since I started to remember things,

351
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,020
we practiced martial arts and swords

352
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,020
and got yelled at together.

353
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
But after I grew up

354
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,460
and became...

355
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,460
Young Master,

356
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,590
don’t expose your identity to strangers easily.

357
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,800
We barely know each other.

358
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,000
You don’t need to tell me everything.

359
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,820
You should learn to

360
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,220
hide your identity in front of others.

361
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,220
Sir.

362
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,020
Sir?

363
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,740
Miss,

364
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,860
once the rain stops,

365
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,380
I'll fire the signal for you

366
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,420
Eat up.

367
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
Sir.

368
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,340
Sir?

369
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,540
Sir,

370
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,540
the rain is about to stop.

371
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,440
We should head back to Dongdu.

372
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,180
Young Master!

373
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,260
Brother Muyuan

374
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,660
Young Master,

375
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,260
I've been looking for you all night.

376
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,190
Are you alright?

377
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,630
Where’s your horse?

378
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,300
I’m glad you're fine. Let’s talk on the way.

379
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,180
Let’s go.

380
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,780
[Chief Disciple of Sword Manor Xia Qingmei]

381
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,000
Peach blossoms are so beautiful.

382
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,980
If Fengzi sees it, she will definitely be happy

383
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,940
Master.

384
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,180
[Leader of Sword Manor Lin Zongxing]

385
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,700
We're leaving for the Hero Assembly today.

386
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,420
I’m confident to win.

387
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,940
Master.

388
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,020
Your swordsmanship has improved significantly.

389
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,020
I couldn’t have come this far

390
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,510
without your teaching.

391
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,380
Rise.

392
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,340
This time, you’ll represent Sword Manor.

393
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,860
Remember to always speak and act cautiously.

394
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,140
I’ll engrave that in my mind

395
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,340
and stay away from all disputes.

396
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,820
You’ll be traveling

397
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
with Nine Moves of Lotus God.

398
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,580
Other sects are eager to get their hands on it.

399
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,710
You must stay alert.

400
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,900
Yes, Master.

401
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,420
I promise

402
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,620
it’ll arrive at the Assembly safely.

403
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,660
Good.

404
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,350
Nine Moves are Hall of Flames’ secret skills.

405
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,550
Whoever practices them will become invincible.

406
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,940
That set of skills used to

407
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,260
cause a bloodbath.

408
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,460
Hadn’t we guarded it,

409
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,960
the chaos wouldn't have stopped.

410
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,580
This Hero Assembly

411
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,860
will decide on the ownership of the manual.

412
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,620
Now that

413
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,420
the five-year pact has ended,

414
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,580
it should be returned to Hall of Flames.

415
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,420
But once they get it back,

416
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,940
panic will rise.

417
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,080
Master, you’re highly respected by all.

418
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,020
Our sect is known to be fair and just.

419
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,900
Qingmei, remember,

420
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
the upcoming competition is only a cover.

421
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,660
Pay attention to what’s going on behind it.

422
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,460
I understand.

423
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,100
[Dongdu]

424
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,340
Young Master,

425
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,840
I’ve asked Haitang and others

426
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,740
to wait for us at Tianbao Inn.

427
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,120
They should've been there by now.

428
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,940
Hadn’t I acted rashly and fallen into the trap,

429
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,160
Paper wouldn't have died,

430
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,180
you wouldn't have had to walk for so long

431
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,420
and our trip wouldn’t have been delayed.

432
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,750
Don’t beat yourself up.

433
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,950
Walking a few miles is nothing.

434
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,180
Let’s have something to eat.

435
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,060
Please enjoy.

436
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,780
Young Master,

437
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,500
you haven’t eaten anything for a night. Dig in.

438
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,860
Muyuan,

439
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,110
Dongdu is surprisingly bustling.

440
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,620
Indeed.

441
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,180
The outside world

442
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,340
isn’t as safe

443
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
as it seems.

444
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,740
You're new to it, Young Master.

445
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,220
Be extremely careful.

446
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,100
Don’t run away alone

447
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,500
like yesterday.

448
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,260
I won’t, Muyuan.

449
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,020
Hey,

450
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,140
stop calling me Young Master.

451
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,460
We aren’t in Hall of Flames anymore.

452
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,420
We're out now.

453
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,680
You can call me Xuezhi.

454
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,350
I’ll still call you Muyuan.

455
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,100
I can’t.

456
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,020
Why?

457
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,179
We used to call each other like that.

458
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,380
That was in the past.

459
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,870
Now it’s different.

460
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
I serve under you

461
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,600
as Chief Guardian.

462
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,780
How could I call you by your name?

463
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,219
It’s an order.

464
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,659
Young Master…

465
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,860
Muyuan, have a bun.

466
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,060
Thank you, Young Master.

467
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,699
Thank you, Xuezhi.

468
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,060
Good. That's right.

469
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,179
Sugar-coated haws!

470
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,940
Miss, buy a painting, please.

471
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:44,260
No.

472
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,139
I haven’t sold one all day.

473
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,460
I need money to buy medicine for my mother.

474
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,500
She is sick.

475
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,460
Please just buy one.

476
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,540
Please. I’m begging you.

477
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,340
Fine. I’ll buy it.

478
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,740
This is Abbess Ciren.

479
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,950
This is Feng Cheng of Huashan Sect.

480
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,500
Who’s this monk?

481
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,340
Leader of Moon Valley, Shangguan Tou,

482
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,180
Imperial Advisor’s son.

483
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,380
It’s also

484
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,220
the best-selling painting.

485
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,780
If he isn’t a monk,

486
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,820
why is he bald?

487
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,060
Rumor has it that he was a womanizer

488
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,740
and fell in love with her schoolmate,

489
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,870
so he shaved his head to prove himself.

490
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,940
Surprisingly,

491
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,980
many followed suit.

492
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,060
They all copied his style?

493
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,420
Were they insane?

494
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
It was true.

495
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,300
It's said that Mr. Shangguan

496
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,700
is more charming in person.

497
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,340
I doubt it.

498
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,340
I bet

499
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,260
the painter

500
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,460
made him look handsome deliberately.

501
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,860
Don’t you agree, Muyuan?

502
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
This gentleman is good-looking

503
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
and charismatic.

504
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,020
You two are a perfect match

505
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,420
and are meant to be.

506
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,500
Aren't you sweet?

507
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,420
Who’s this ugly shrew?

508
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,140
Leader of Hall of Flames, Chong Xuezhi.

509
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,420
She’s in charge of a cult

510
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,580
and is intimidating.

511
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,980
Did you ever see her?

512
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,220
How did you know her look?

513
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,140
I...I dare not see her in person.

514
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,820
They say she’s heartless.

515
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,380
Whoever saw her all died horribly.

516
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,300
I...

517
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,060
Xuezhi,

518
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,900
don’t take those rumors seriously.

519
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,540
I...

520
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,900

I don’t think it's that bad.

You aren’t the one in it.

529

I recognized you instantly.

If others see this,

548
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
they’ll think we side with

Hall of Flames.

550
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,900

Fengzi, just ignore her.

556
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,420
She sounds insolent.

557
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,700
How ungrateful!

558
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,940
Hadn’t it been for Sword Manor’s protection
