00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 4

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,669
I can tell you now.

5
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,880
The one I need to protect

6
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,670
is…

7
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,270
you.

8
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
Protect me?

9
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,630
That’s right, it's you.

10
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,030
My savior told me that

11
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,000
the Hall of Flames is in plight,

12
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,670
and you’re too naïve

13
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,520
to protect yourself from danger.

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,630
So he asked me

15
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,630
to keep you safe.

16
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,360
That’s why you helped me out

17
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,560
in the Hero Assembly.

18
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,630
Mr. Shangguan,

19
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,360
who’s your savior?

20
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,130
Why does he need to protect me?

21
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,550
You’ll know one day.

22
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,550
Also,

23
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,030
please keep it as a secret,

24
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,160
will you?

25
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,030
From now on.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,270
I will protect you

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,270
from any possible harm.

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,250
You’re back, Young Master.

29
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Young Master,

30
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,390
have you found anything?

31
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,240
We’ve been to almost all hostels

32
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,600
and asked all people possible,

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
but still we’ve got nothing.

34
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,250
What about you?

35
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
What?

36
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,030
Chequ’s drunk.

37
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,760
She’s sleeping now in her room.

38
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,600
What about you, Young Master?

39
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
I’ve got nothing.

40
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,070
Then,

41
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,410
let’s call it a day.

42
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,070
Have a good rest.

43
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,850
We’ll continue tomorrow.

44
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,550
OK.

45
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,160
OK.

46
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,230
Go.

47
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,280
What’s in your hand, Young Master?

48
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,190
It’s nothing.

49
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,600
Show me.

50
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,470
It’s nothing.

51
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,540
Just go to sleep.

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,659
-Hurry up. Go back now.
-Young Master...

53
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,720
-Since when you keep a secret from us?
-Go back now.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
Exactly.

55
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,480
You’re doing good.

56
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,350
Sugar-coated haws.

57
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,790
Boy,

58
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,410
how long have you been here?

59
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,600
I don’t remember.

60
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,350
You don’t remember?

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,350
I’ve told you on the first day you came

62
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,950
that you couldn’t work here without paying us.

63
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,670
Do you have memory problem?

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,390
I…I don’t have money.

65
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,000
None of your business.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,160
Please.

67
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,390
You have no money?

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,050
Get rid of his stuff.

69
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,830
No.

70
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,550
Please. Leave me alone.

71
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,600
Stop it.

72
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,000
Flowers. Have a look.

73
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,040
Sir, come and have a look.

74
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
Nice and fragrant flowers.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,920
Have a look.

76
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,040
Flowers.

77
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,350
Thank you.

78
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,130
You…you’re Shangguan Tou?

79
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,350
You know me?

80
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,510
See?

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,320
I saw you on the Hero Assembly.

82
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,640
Nice drawing.

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
What happened?

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Some rascals asked me for money,

85
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,040
and I didn’t have money.

86
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
So they destroyed my stand.

87
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,110
Take it.

88
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,770
Thank you, brother!

89
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,320
Boy, where’ are your parents?

90
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,159
Why are you selling your drawings here alone?

91
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,360
I don’t have parents.

92
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,950
I used to steal things for food.

93
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,110
But I don’t want to keep doing that.

94
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,470
I want to be a nice guy.

95
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,230
You draw all these?

96
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,230
This is Luduan Temple?

97
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,880
Yes.

98
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,790
Wang Yinya?

99
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,230
Boy,

100
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,870
why did you draw him with Luduan Temple?

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,930
He was in Luduan Temple that night.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,730
I saw him when passing by, so I drew that like this.

[Tianbao Inn]

104
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,350

105
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,880
with Liuli today.

106
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,160

go to the wharves with Chequ.

108
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,390
-Yes.
-Yes.

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,650
The eagle has not returned yet.

110
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,120
I wonder what Chief Guardian has found,

111
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,930
and if he has returned to the Hall.

112
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,480
Hope he won’t be punished by the elders

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,110
when he got to the Hall.

114
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,820
Who are you?

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,510
I’m Wuming. Mr. Shangguan sent me to invite

116
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,920
Young Master and the guardians to his place.

117
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,760
Why isn’t he home yet?

118
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,070
Sir,

119
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
Chief Guardian went to the Sword Manor

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,390
to check

121
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,790
if they had stolen the manual.

122
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,550
But,

123
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,600
he’s with…

124
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,830
What?

125
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,760
The Lotus Sutra is with him.

126
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,440
I wanted to let him take

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,510
Chong Xuezhi’s place when she’s away.

128
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,600
But I didn’t expect him doing so.

129
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,070
The Lotus Sutra is our top treasure.

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,480
Don’t let the Sword Manor have it.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hold him first.

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,640
Tell him…

[Sword Manor]

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,110
Mr. Lin,

135
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,080
the theft of the manual is not an accident.

136
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,150
It must be a well-planned action.

137
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,150
But I am clueless now.

138
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,000
I kindly ask for your advice.

139
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,850
We endorsed you at that time

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
because we didn’t want you to have

141
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,080
dispute with other schools anymore.

142
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,550
I had my agenda to be the mediator.

143
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,880
Your godfather, Chong Ye, is an old friend of mine.

144
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,680
And Lin Changran is my brother. We were very close.

145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,030
So I definitely want the Hall of Flames to rise again,

146
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,290
and to keep the manual.

147
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,110
I guess the thief

148
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,910
is trying to provoke dissension,

149
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,590
turning the Hall of Flames

150
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,190
against the Sword Manor.

151
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,870
Don’t worry, Mr. Lin.

152
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,520
The Sword Manor has done a lot for us.

153
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,880
We will never forget that.

154
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,790
It’s just your manor’s involvement

155
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,670
might have hurt your reputation.

156
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,910
We have to apologize to you.

157
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,320
No need.

158
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,560
This is how the world works.

159
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,590
A drip makes a big splash.

160
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,110
When Mr. Chong Ye turned extreme

161
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,240
and became to public enemy,

162
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,930
I didn’t manage to save him

163
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
though I tried hard.

164
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,470
It was like yesterday.

165
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,350
What a pity.

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,650
right after the manual went missing.

177
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,160
He told me that we were still suspects.

178
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,910
We are responsible to help you with the investigation.

179
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,030
I’ll do my best to help.

[Chamber of Firewood]

181
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,710
You’re here.

182
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,880
Mr. Shangguan,

183
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,030
why do you want us here?

184
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,160
There’s something we need to discuss.

185
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,350
Please come in.

186
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,000
Come out.

187
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Here.

188
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,030
It’s you again?

189
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,640
Sorry, Miss.

190
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,080
I shouldn’t have cheated you.

191
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,680
I don’t have parents or anyone to count on.

192
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,280
And I was taught to steal and cheat…

193
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,880
I didn’t mean to…

194
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
Don’t cry.

195
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,400
So

196
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,590
you are an orphan like us.

197
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
There, there.

198
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,520
Everyone,

199
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,520
we invite you here

200
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,200
to tell you some

201
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,530
more important things.

202
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,780
It’s about the manual.

203
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,080
On the night of the Hero Assembly,

204
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
he was right outside of Luduan Temple.

205
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,200
What did you see?

206
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,690
I lived next to Luduan Temple.

207
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,440
That night, on my way to the toilet,

208
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,150
I saw someone.

209
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,400
Who?

210
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,150
Wang Yinya.

211
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,110
He was sneaking around,

212
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,150
like a thief.

213
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,700
I guessed he must be doing something bad,

214
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,230
so I hid.

215
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,110
You’re sure that was him?

216
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,590
How could I draw this if I didn’t

217
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,840
see him clearly.

218
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,520
This is what I want to tell you.

219
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,230
So you think

220
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,400
it was Wang Yinya?

221
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
Everyone came to the Hero Assembly

222
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,520
with hidden agendas.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,960
They all wanted the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

224
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,890
Though we don’t have evidence yet,

225
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,880
Wang Yinya’s visit to Luduan Temple

226
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
on the night when the manual was lost

227
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,210
is very suspicious.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,790
Right.

229
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,200
I heard that

230
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,880
he left the next day

231
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,550
right after the Assembly finished.

232
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,710
He must be in a rush.

233
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,000
Where is he now?

234
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,230
He’s not returned to the Silver Whip School.

235
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,360
I think he’s heading northeastwards.

236
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,710
Northeastwards?

237
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,520
But the Silver Whip School is on the southwest.

238
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,080
Yes.

239
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,960
Maybe he’s seeing someone?

240
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,320
I heard that

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,110
he had a junior in Xiangzhou.

242
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,840
Xiangzhou is to the southeast of Dongdu.

243
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,840
Will he be there?

244
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,110
Then

245
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,960
let’s go to Xiangzhou first

246
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,310
to see what we can get.

247
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,440
Young Master,

248
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,960
I think we need a second thought.

249
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,210
Please let me report to the elderly

250
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,400
No.

251
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,110
It’ll take a long time for the eagle to deliver message.

252
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,710
I will use what I’ve got

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,030
to find the Nine Moves of Lotus God

254
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,590
and to undo the wrong.

255
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,080
Chequ,

256
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,350
send the rest of the disciples back.

257
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,550
Five of us will be enough for Xiangzhou.

258
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes.

259
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,110
Qingmei.

260
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,150

261
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,200
Fengzi.

262
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,530
I’ve come to see you.

263
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,200
I heard that Chief Guardian Muyuan

264
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
helped you come back.

265
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,760
How are you doing now?

266
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,790
It’s much better now.

267
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,440
That’s good news.

268
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,400
Then I’ll leave you some space.

269
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,670
Wait…

270
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,160
This is my first time to really see him,

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,320
am I nothing compared with

272
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,350

273
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,280
Hey,

274
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,040
what do you think is on Young Master’s mind?

275
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,440
The manual?

276
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,640
I don’t think so.

277
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,640
I bet it’s Mr. Shangguan.

278
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,550
See how happy she was the other night.

279
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,680
That must be a gift from Mr. Shangguan.

280
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,760
What are you thinking about?

281
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,560
Finish your meal and we gotta go.

282
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,760
We need to arrive in Xiangzhou before it’s dark.

283
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,590
Xiangzhou?

284
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,960
People say that’s a place for nice food,

285
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,280
I’ll stop now.

286
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,230
To save some space

287
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,960
for better food tonight.

288
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
What a foodie.

289
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,320
I’m a foodie,

290
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,710

Getting some food for Young Master.

295

Go pack up your stuff.

296

299

Just show up.

I’ve found you at last.

302

Did grandpa send you here?

303
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,230
It’s not Elder Yuwen.

304
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,230
He knows

305
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,110
that you want to assist Young Master

306
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,570
and hate to take her place.

307
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,370
He has long accepted the fact.

308
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,960
So he wants to solve all misunderstandings

309
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,440
before he dies.

310
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
Before he dies?

311
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,230
After you left the Hall of Flames,

312
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,640
he fell really sick.

313
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,680
He didn’t want to disturb you
during the Hero Assembly

314
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,160
so we’ve been keeping this from you.

But several days ago,

316
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,520

I’m afraid that…

319

I’m afraid that he is about to…

320
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,280
I see.

321
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,770
I’m going back to the Hall.

322

But Young Master...

323
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,560
I will inform her.

Don’t worry.

333

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,450
things had become this terrible.

349
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Where are the people who lived here?

350
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,920
They’ve long gone

351
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,680
after the flood.

352
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,640
Where are they now?

353
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,760
Homeless.

354
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,310
Some

355
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,580
left for other places with families.

356
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,520
And some

357
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
stayed in clan halls.

358
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,740
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

359
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,380
Your Highness.

360
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,350
Zheng.

361
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,380
Is Your Highness worrying

362
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,590
about the endless rains lately?

363
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,350
Yes.

364
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,230
You know me.

365
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,030
It’s been raining cats and dogs lately.

366
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,500
Many parts of Yinzhang’s 12 dams are broken.

367
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,400
People are homeless.

368
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,740
[Princess Lu, Shangguan Zheng]

369
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,560
That really upsets me.

370
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,090
If we don’t do something

371
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,420
as it keeps raining like this,

372
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,990
refugees will increase.

373
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,980
And there will be disease,

374
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,470
or plague.

375
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,280
Then there will be more disasters.

376
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,110
Your Highness,

377
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,050
God knows how you love your people

378
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,880
and will help you with this.

379
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,830
With you as their prince,

380
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,310
the Xiangzhou people will live through this.

381
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,710
Everything will be fine.

382
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,010
Please don’t ponder too much on this.

383
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,230
Please care for your own health.

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,920
Zheng,

385
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,590
after I was diagnosed to have heart issues,

386
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
my father

387
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,760
sent me here

388
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,890
to the remote and tranquil Xiangzhou.

389
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,880
True that this is what I want,

390
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
being far away from politics

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,600
and complicated relations.

392
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
But I’m still unhappy.

393
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,590
I feel useless.

394
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,830
I can’t share the burdens
with my father and brothers.

395
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,430
If I can’t even

396
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,090
deal with the troubles here in my jurisdiction,

397
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
then I’ll be a complete waste.

398
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,750
How should I face the people here

399
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,680
living in plight?

400
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,960
But, Your Highness,

401
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,710
human beings can never

402
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,590
manipulate natural disasters.

403
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,810
You’ve done well already.

404
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,070
Your Highness,

405
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,280
do you think you could

406
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,310
write to the crown prince for help?

407
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,520
We don’t know when the rain will stop.

408
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
After this,

409
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,950
we need to resettle the people.

410
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,040
Then there might be plagues to deal with.

411
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
We will need plenty of materials and human resources.

412
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,070
As well as people with experience of disaster relief.

413
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,090
Your Highness,

414
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,630
you are not feeling well…

415
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,400
I’m worried.

416
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
I don’t want you to

417
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,470
shoulder the burden all by yourself.

418
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,680
Zheng,

419
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,040
I do need help.

420
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,400
But I’m not sure if I want

421
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,350
to turn to my brother.

422
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,350
Zheng,

423
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,640
don’t worry about my health.

424
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,760
You’ve been nursing my health

425
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,110
in the past years.

426
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,760
I’m fine now.

427
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,570
It’s just I’m so worried these days

428
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,330
that I don’t feel well sometimes.

429
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,110
But that’s not a big deal.

430
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
It is my fortune

431
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,040
to have a wife like you.

432
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,740
How’s it going?

433
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,660
Fu Yiya, Wang Yinya’s junior,

434
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
will celebrate his son’s first month.

435
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,450
I guess Wang Yinya is coming

436
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,110
for this celebration.

437
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,920
Celebration?

438
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,190
There must be something else.

439
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,110
Why?

440
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,040
Rumor has it

441
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,650
Wang Yinya and Fu Yiya have been at odds

442
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,560
though they are under the same school.

443
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,110
When Wang got to be the chief,

444
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,000
Fu had no choice but resigned

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,830
and became a businessman here in Xiangzhou.

446
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,520
They haven’t

447
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,250
talked to each other for years.

448
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,800
How could Fu invite Wang to the celebration?

449
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,920
I see.

450
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,190
Then,

451
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,970
will this be about the manual?

452
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
I don’t know yet.

453
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,560
But let’s figure out

454
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,760
all questions.

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What’s your plan,

456
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,020
Mr. Shangguan?

457
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,120
Let’s check in an inn first.

458
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,860
[Lord Xin’s Mansion]

459
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,110
Your Royal Highness.

460
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,800
You may rise.

461
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,980
[Crown Prince, Xue Xin]

462
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,000
How is His Majesty doing?

463
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,000
His Majesty is in good health.

464
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,710
Thank you for asking.

465
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,520
Are there any

466
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,240
political troubles?

467
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,160
Everything goes well

468
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,690
with administration.

469
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,760
there is

470
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,160
any news from Xiangzhou?

471
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,160
Your Highness must be caring about Lord Lu.

472
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,480
His Highness has not sent any message lately.

473
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,230
But I heard that

474
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,310
Xiangzhou is attacked by a flood.

475
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,640
It has been raining heavily for days.

476
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,560
People became homeless.

477
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,230
Many refugees from Xiangzhou have come to Dongdu.

478
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,560
And

479
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,480
it is said that it’s becoming worse and worse.

480
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,440
The productive fields might be destroyed.

481
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,950
I am not sure

482
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,880
how His Highness will handle this.

483
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,470
Xiangzhou

484
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,130
is under my brother’s jurisdiction.

485
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,640
Has His Majesty offered them help?

486
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,330
I have not heard of that yet.

487
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,430
My brother

488
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,560
didn’t like politics.

489
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,520
So he didn’t have experience of disaster relief.

490
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,050
And he’s not in good health.

491
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,000
The flood is too fierce for him.

492
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,110
I’m afraid that

493
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,250
he can’t cope with this.

494
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,710
Well,

495
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,830
send a message

496
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,650
to Xiangzhou and ask

497
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,440
if there’s anything

498
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,640
we can do.

499
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,590
Dongdu,

500
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,640
and I, as his brother,

501
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,570
we will do our best to help.

502
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,110
Yes, Your Highness.

503
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,950
In fact,

504
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,280
we all witnessed Lord Lu’s gift

505
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,680
when he was younger.

506
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,350
If his health allows him,

507
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,110
he might…

508
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,770
That’s not the case.

509
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,070
My brother

510
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
is kind, pure,

511
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
and indifferent to power and wealth.

512
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,940
He’s been in leisure for years

513
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,760
in Xiangzhou.

514
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,900
What worries me is that

515
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,470
if flood comes again,

516
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,800
the people in Xiangzhou

517
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,110
will suffer a lot.

518
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,400
Your Highness treat people as your own children.

519
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,470
His Majesty will

520
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,950
see what’s been done.

521
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,950
Is that so?

522
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,800
But my care for my brother

523
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,590
somehow embarrasses

524
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,640
myself.

525
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,310
Go.

526
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,040
Write a letter

527
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,190
to Lord Lu.

528
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,520
Ask him

529
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,830
what we can do

530
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
to help.

531
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Yes.

[Yuelai Inn]

533
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,760
Even our stable is better than this place.

534
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,830
We won’t stay here for long.

535
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,830
Just hold on a bit.

536
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,350
OK.

537
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,910
It’s been raining for two weeks.

538
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,230
The roof’s going to crush.

539
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,160
How can I sleep on a wet bed?

540
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,190
Just hold on.

Miss Chong.

543
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,930
Why are you here?

544
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,680
I have some news for you.

545
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,040
Come in, please.

546
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,680
Mr. Shangguan,

547
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,920
please sit here.

548
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,310
Mr. Shangguan,

549
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,560
I’ll go and fetch you some water.

550
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,310
Thanks.

551
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,710
When did you arrive?

552
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,760
Four hours earlier than you.

553
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,960
You arrived earlier?

554
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,950
You’ve been looking around along the way.

555
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,590
So you were

556
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,920
inevitably slower than me walking alone.

557
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,570
I’ve found something.

558
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,830
Tomorrow will be the first month’s celebration

559
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,430
of Fu Yiya’s son.

560
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,110
Wang Yinya will be there.

561
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:04,830
Really?

562
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,350
Then we can sneak in.

563
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,800
Don’t bother.

564
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,950
I have this.

565
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,800
The invitation.

566
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,830
Mr. Shangguan, there’s nothing you can’t do,

567
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,960
How did you get this?

568
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,710
Easy-peasy.

569
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,400
Th…Thanks.

570
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,680
Why isn’t Haitang back

571
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,350
with water yet?

572
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
We don’t need her for water.

573
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,050
I have water with me.

574
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,590
On my way here, I happened to find a spring.

575
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,760
The water there was clear and sweet.

576
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,950
So I took a bottle of it.

577
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,150
Would you like to try?

578
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,190
Please.

579
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,760
Nice.

580
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,800
That must be a spring from deep down the earth.

581
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,110
It’s an old spring,

582
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,880
perfect for brew alcohol.

583
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,520
If you

584
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
keep the alcohol in a deep cellar for 3 years,

585
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,590
its taste of grain

586
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,250
will become even more mellow.

587
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,120
You know alcohol very well.

588
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,470
Just a little.

589
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,430
My father

590
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,280
loves alcohol.

591
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,230
I started to

592
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,950
taste spirits with him as a child.

593
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,710
But I don’t really drink much.

594
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,930
You taste alcohol but don’t fall victim to it.

595
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,680
But I bet

596
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,520
your father must be a heavy drinker

597
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,780
who drinks like a fish.

598
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,520
That’s what people believe.

599
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,640
But

600
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,110
that’s because he always acted normally

601
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,280
when he was drunk.

602
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,000
You won’t find out

603
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
if you don’t push him.

604
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
What if I push him?

605
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,430
He’d fall down.

606
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,800
You look pretty

607
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,040
when you smile.

608
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,350
Then

609
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,800
what’s your father like,

610
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Mr. Shangguan?

611
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,190
My father…

612
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,470
I don’t really know.

613
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,310
Are you kidding?

614
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
Don’t you live

615
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,040
with your father?

616
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,520
My family is special.

617
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,350
I see.

618
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,880
The noble Shangguan family

619
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,520
must be different from ours.

I say

621
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,000
your father must be a nice man

622
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,800
just like you.

Please go to bed early.

630
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,030
I’ll leave the spring

What is she doing there?

My guess is

692
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,560
that she thinks

693
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,320

He has long left the Silver Whip School.

716

This is a celebration

732
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,810
so he left his silver whip home?

733
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,000
On behalf of my family,

734

Where are they?

752

Wang can vanish in the thin air.

753
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Did he steal the manual and

754
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,370
start to practice already?

755
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,950
That’s possible.

756

Fu Yiya resigned from the martial world

757

for years.

758
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,610
Few people will notice him.

759
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,390
Fu’s Mansion will be a perfect place

760
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,870
to practice martial arts.

761
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,710

And the leader of the Moon Valley.

780
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,910
So are you a martial man

781
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,860
or do you work for the government?

782
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,950
I’m not working for the government.

783
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,710
Neigther i am manipulated by the art martial world.

784
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,520
I only

785
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,280
work to keep you safe.

786
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,370
Where do you think I belong to?

787
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
I heard that

788
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,560
Xiangzhou

789
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,230
is Lord Lu’s jurisdiction.

790
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,950
Then

791
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,910
who is Lord Lu?

792
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,560
The second son of the Emperor.

793
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,290
Your sister is a princess, right?

794
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,670
Is she Lord Lu’s….

795
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,670
She’s his wife.

796
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,990
Then why don’t you visit her?

797
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,910
What are you…

798
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,370
What’s that supposed to mean?

799
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,080
I’ll tell you.

800
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,800
There is different people in the imperial family.

801
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Some are enshrined

802
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and worshiped.

803
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,120
And some

804
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,970
are marginalized and materialized.

805
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,910
From the perspective of imperial family,

806
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,480
the Shangguan family

807
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,930
is more like the latter.

808
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,040
Your father

809
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,440
is the Imperial Advisor,

810
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,950
and has a prince

811
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,390
as his son-in-law.

812
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,130
How could he be marginalized?

813
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,740
His Majesty has many sons.

814
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,080
And the second son

815
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,670
was not born by the Empress.

816
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,320
The Empress doesn’t like him.

817
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,520
Therefore,

818
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,800
not a single official

819
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,760
speaks for him.

820
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,470
I see.

821
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,470
He’s just like me.

I’m the Young Master of the Hall of Flames.

I’m controlled by the guardians.

828
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,320
No freedom at all.

829
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,460

But…

That’s profound.

872
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,280
and the leader of the Moon Valley.

873
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,280
And you are handsome and charming…

874
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,040
Mr. Fu, I’ll get down to business.

875
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,800
We’ve come here

876
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,440
asking for the missing Nine Moves of Lotus God.

877
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,710
Missing?

878
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,470
I know you’ve been

879
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,040
long resigned from the  art martial world.

880
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,950
But

881
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,520
you must have heard of

882
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,870
the Nine Moves of Lotus God being stolen

883
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,730
during the Hero Assembly, right?

884
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,910
I did hear of it.

885
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,600
But why did you

886
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,230
come to my place for this?

887
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,470
Do you think

888
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,670
it’s me who stole the manual?

889
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,230
Everyone

890
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,360
in the martial world

891
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,190
knows that

892
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,190
I have resigned

893
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,950
from the martial world for years.

894
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,150
I don’t care about their stuff anymore.

895
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,670
Nor do I want any fame.

896
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,840
You don’t want fame,

897
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,560
but your senior,

898
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,520
Wang Yinya,

899
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,360
will definitely want it.

900
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,360
Someone saw Mr. Wang wandering around

901
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,950
the room that kept the manual

902
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,670
on the night of Hero Assembly.

903
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,120
That is suspicious, right?
