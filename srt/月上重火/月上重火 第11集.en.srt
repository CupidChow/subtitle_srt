00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 11

4
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,440
I can’t…

5
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,960
I fear…

6
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,160
I fear that

7
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,320
once I try,

8
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,440
my rejection to love will hurt Chong.

9
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,030
If I can’t get rid of my concerns,

10
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,520
I won’t be 100% true to her.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,750
And that will cause her pain

12
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,720
and harm.

13
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,190
If so,

14
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,640
why should I make this mistake?

15
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,630
I see.

16
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,030
But think about it twice.

17
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,000
Sometimes when you let someone go,

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,930
you will regret for the whole life.

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,240
For you

20
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,240
and for her.

21
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,160
I don’t want you to regret.

22
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,250
There you go.

23
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,550
Xuezhi.

24
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,190
Muyuan.

25
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,910
I knew

26
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,370
you’d make it through.

27
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,250
How are you now?

28
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,670
Are you injured?

29
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
I’m fine.

30
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,970
That’s good.

31
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,960
Muyuan.

32
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,590
How’s the Hall of Flames?

33
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,830
And how’s everyone?

34
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,390
Everyone’s fine.

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,830
If you’re OK,

36
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,830
then the Hall of Flames will

37
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,630
live through all obstacles.

38
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Muyuan,

39
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,920
I don’t want to be here anymore.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,010
I want to go back to the Hall.

41
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,230
OK.

42
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,720
We are going now.

43
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,830
You can’t leave yet.

44
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
That’s not up to you.

45
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,270
How strange.

46
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,440
You even change your tone

47
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,640
after you became the Leader.

48
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,110
I’ll suggest that you think about

49
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,040
how to prove your innocence first.

50
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,920
Muyuan,

51
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,170
are you really the Leader now?

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,920
Yes.

53
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,670
You became the Leader

54
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,160
upon hearing of her “death’.

55
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,710
I sent Wuming to sound you out

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,070
to see how

57
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,320
you’d defend yourself.

58
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,320
Xuezhi,

59
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,910
the Hall of Flames was faced with

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
threats from both inside and outside.

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,160
It was urgent.

62
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,230
I had no choice

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
but to assume the leader.

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Otherwise

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,640
the Hall of Flames

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,510
would become headless.

67
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
So, I decided to be the

68
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,880
interim leader.

69
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
That would also help to find you sooner.

70
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,920
So…

71
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,040
Sooner?

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Where were you when Xuezhi

73
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,270
was facing life-and-death threat?

74
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,270
Where were you

75
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,480
when she was on a run

76
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,600
and homeless?

77
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,480
And my little test for you

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,200
has lured you here

79
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,200
much sooner than I expected.

80
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,040
You are really doing

81
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,270
what an honest gentleman should do.

82
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,440
And Leader Yuwen is also

83
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,750
fulfilling his duty perfectly.

84
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,640
If Xuezhi wants to leave,

85
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,380
I’ll take her away whatever it takes.

86
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,670
She won’t set a single step out of here today.

87
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,600
I don’t think so.

88
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,510
I’ll make you do.

89
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,320
Stop it.

90
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,330
Don’t make a scene out of yourselves.

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,790
Uncle Lin.

92
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,830
Muyuan.

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,920
In my memory,

94
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,670
you were poised and quiet

95
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,110
when you were younger.

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,810
Why have you become impulsive now?

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,200
And you too.

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,850
It’s necessary to be resourceful,

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
but how can you suspect Muyuan?

100
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,670
We are family.

101
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,890
We should be working together.

102
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,350
Don’t generate disputes among ourselves.

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,670
Sorry.

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,510
Xuezhi,

105
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,320
do you think

106
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
I’ve betrayed you?

107
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,070
I know

108
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,070
I don’t really care about

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,770
what others think of me.

110
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,790
But I do care about

111
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,670
what you think.

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,550
I’m leaving

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,600
for the Hall of Flames now

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,660
to resign from the Leader.

115
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,640
Then

116
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,990
I’ll leave the Hall for good.

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,480
So that

118
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
you can be reassured.

119
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,600
Goodbye.

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,510
Muyuan.

121
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,690
There is only one Young Master

122
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,640
of the Hall of Flames.

123
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,080
And that is you.

124
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
It is in your blood.

125
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,670
You are born to take this position,

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,770
and the responsibilities as well.

127
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
And me?

128
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,500
All I should do is to be by your side

129
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,150
and assist you.

130
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,710
Muyuan,

131
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,360
Thank you for always being there for me

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,640
when I am upset

133
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,710
and need you most.

134
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,000
Remember, I am your brother.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,440
We’ll be oceans apart tomorrow.

136
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,090
I heard what you’ve said

137
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
just now.

138
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I apologize to you

139
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,160
for doing you wrong.

140
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,590
If

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,960
you care about Xuezhi that much,

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,590
then

143
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,550
the last thing you want see

144
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,550
is she being in danger again, right?

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,440
What’s your point?

146
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,320
I know

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
you want to take her away.

148
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,330
But if she leaves here unprepared,

149
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,550
everyone will know

150
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
she’s still alive.

151
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,150
Then her enemies

152
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,290
will obviously try to kill her again.

153
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,470
Now she’s safe here in the Moon Valley

154
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,230
with the meticulous care

155
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,030
from Mr. Lin and me.

156
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Think about the big picture.

157
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,350
Please

158
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,770
cooperate with us.

159
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,880
The best choice is to keep her

160
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,880
from the public

161
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,650
until the Weapon Ranking Convention.

162
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,320
I didn’t know

163
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,790
you had a plan like this.

164
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,350
So

165
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,100
we’ve reached consensus now?

166
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,030
Just for now.

167
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,480
The guest room is ready.

168
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,000
Please have a rest.

169
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,970
Thank you, Master.

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,910
That sounds familiar.

171
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,230
Master,

172
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,570
are you worried about Miss Chong?

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
I must have hurt her

174
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
by my words today.

175
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,850
I’ve already noticed her feelings for me

176
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,760
back at Winehouse of Fairyland.

177
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,150
But

178
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,470
that’s a too heavy responsibility for me.

179
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,260
She’s not the only one that gets hurt.

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,500
If you’re not hurt,

181
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,130
you won’t be here, frustrated.

182
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,860
[Sword Manor]

183
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Any news from the Hall of Flames?

184
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,760
Not yet.

185
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,000
Years ago

186
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,030
when Chong Ye cut his own throat,

187
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,880
the Hall of Flames would have been

188
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,030
swept away if you didn’t

189
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,280
calm the public down and

190
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,710
ask them to drop the case.

191
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,000
We have done enough

192
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
for the Hall of Flames.

193
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,440
That’s true.

194
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,030
If you didn’t speak for the Hall of Flames

195
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,470
breaking off all ties with them and

196
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,000
promising to stay neutral,

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,030
the public would never

198
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,520
let them go.

199
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,320
Though we have been proved

200
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
innocent of destroying the manual,

201
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,110
I’m still feeling guilty

202
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,850
since we’ve been old friends with the Hall

203
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,110
and the manual was replaced

204
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,570
when you were guarding it.

205
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
It’s all my fault.

206
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,760
I should have kept a closer eye on it.

207
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,360
It’s not the time to find out who’s to blame now.

208
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
The Weapon Ranking Convention will soon kick off.

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,690
People will then

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,840
find fault with the Hall of Flames.

211
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,030
Qingmei,

212
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,350
go to the convention now

213
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,590
and help the Hall

214
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,160
when it’s necessary.

215
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,960
But remember,

216
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,200
the Hall is now a common target.

217
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,230
If we openly support them,

218
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,520
they’ll think we’re covering them up.

219
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,200
So

220
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,650
help them secretly.

221
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,190
Don’t make new troubles.

222
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,550
Don’t worry, Master.

223
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,350
I’ll bear your words in mind.

224
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,470
Good.

225
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,590
Mr. Lin,

226
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,700
Mr. Xia excels in martial art indeed,

227
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,590
but he’ll be in danger

228
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,190
if confronted by the public.

229
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,760
I think Fengzi and I should go along

230
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,470
to help him.

231
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:36,590
Father,

232
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,850
I’d love to go to the convention with him.

233
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,150
What do you think,

234
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,590
Qingmei?

235
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,200
The convention is a place that gathers experts.

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,320
If Ms. Yuan can come with me,

237
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
it’ll be my pleasure.

238
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,910
Fine.

239
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,080
Then

240
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,650
you should go together.

241
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,080
Thank you, Master.

242
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,140
Thank you, Father.

243
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,350
Uncle Lin,

244
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,280
please hold on.

245
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,640
I’ve got what I want

246
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,370
to see Xuezhi’s safe here.

247
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,880
The Weapon Ranking Convention

248
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,960
will start soon,

249
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,110
and I need to go back to the Hall

250
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,370
and prepare for it with other disciples.

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,710
OK.

252
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Muyuan,

253
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,670
I want to come with you.

254
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
We’ve discussed this, right?

255
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,750
You need to hide up now

256
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,840
and wait until

257
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,300
it’s a good time to show up.

258
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,200
That’s right.

259
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,910
You enemies will act against you

260
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,840
on the Weapon Ranking Convention.

261
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,710
You’d better do nothing for now.

262
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
And if you still don’t

263
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
feel at ease,

264
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,960
I can lead the disciples to Dongdu first

265
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,560
and then come to pick you up.

266
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,030
Fine.

267
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,010
Don’t bother, Chief Guardian.

268
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,740
I’ll escort Miss Chong to Dongdu.

269
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,160
Then

270
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,190
I’ll say goodbye.

271
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,310
Fengzi,

272
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
we’re not leaving yet

273
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,770
and you’re packing up already?

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,680
Yes.

275
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,190
My master and I

276
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,990
will go to Dongdu in advance and walk around there.

277
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,230
Dongdu?

278
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,360
You’re going to see Shangguan Tou?

279
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Kind of.

280
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,360
I don’t understand.

281
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,590
What’s so special about this flirty man

282
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,400
that you’re so into him?

283
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,430
Flirty man?

284
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,230
He’s the only son of the Imperial Advisor.

285
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,690
And I am the only daughter of the Sword Manor.

286
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,000
We are like perfect match.

287
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,280
No matter what happens,

288
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,680
and who pops up,

289
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,720
he and I will never be apart.

290
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,340
Mr. Lin will not agree on this.

291
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
It’s not up to him.

292
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,950
And it’s not up to you either.

293
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,000
Get out of here.

294
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,190
Shangguan.

295
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,520
Miss Chong.

296
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,230
I’ve come to

297
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,470
say thank you to you.

298
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,070
I still need your help

299
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,160
on the way to Dongdu.

300
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,640
But I promise

301
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,880
I will never bother you again

302
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,680
when this is over.

303
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,070
Are you trying

304
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,640
to push me away?

305
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,400
No.

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
It’s just

307
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,210
I suddenly found myself

308
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,640
being ridiculous in the past days.

309
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,000
I should be clearing the name

310
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,830
of the Hall of Flames.

311
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,180
But I’ve failed to do anything

312
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,850
ever since I left home.

313
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
The Nine Moves has been burned.

314
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,800
Wang Yinya has been murdered

315
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,710
to seal the secret.

316
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,490
Everyone in the martial world

317
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,420
is treating me as a threat to them.

318
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,160
Anyway,

319
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,720
I can still live with these.

320
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,800
The real shocker is

321
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,710
my most trusted best friend

322
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,310
the one who grew up together with me,

323
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,830
has been spying on me for the traitors

324
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,590
and even tried to kill me.

325
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,400
Shangguan,

326
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,190
you were right.

327
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,070
I’ve been too naive about

328
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,190
people’s heart.

329
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,680
I know this must be

330
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,210
too much for you to cope with

331
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,590
at your age.

332
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,280
But

333
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,250
you’re about to set off.

334
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:47,950
You’d better

335
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,550
put aside all these worries.

336
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,950
After all

337
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,640
Mr. Lin and I

338
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,680
will make sure that you’re safe.

339
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,280
There’s no need, Shangguan.

340
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,110
True that

341
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,350
you’ve been protecting me very well

342
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,680
ever since I met you.

343
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
And I feel reassured with you by my side.

344
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,070
But I can’t afford

345
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,560
to rely on you.

346
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I don’t want to

347
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,110
be coward again

348
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,590
when you leave me.

349
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,000
We are from different worlds.

350
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,640
You are the son of the Imperial Advisor

351
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,440
and the leader of the Moon River.

352
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,680
And I…

353
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,590
I am a curse to everyone.

354
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,400
I can’t drag you down.

355
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,730
No matter what you say,

356
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,140
I’ll deliver my promise to Mr. Lin

357
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,110
and keep you safe.

358
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,310
OK.

359
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,190
But some day

360
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,310
you will

361
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,040
leave me

362
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,370
and stop protecting me,

363
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,830
won’t you?

364
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,190
If so

365
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,040
I want us

366
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,160
to be honest

367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,800
with each other.

368
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
See you then.

369
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,560
Sir, Leader’s back.

370
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,680
Who’s with him?

371
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,110
He’s alone.

372
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,430
Grandpa, I’m back.

373
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,710
Muyuan,

374
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,520
you are the Leader of the Hall.

375
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
How could you leave

376
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,950
without a word?

377
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,880
Grandpa,

378
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,830
please punish me then.

379
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,160
Never mind.

380
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,590
How can I punish

381
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,850
the Leader of the Hall?

382
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,560
Why did you go out?

383
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
The Weapon Ranking Convention is coming

384
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,470
in a few days.

385
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,560
I worried that

386
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,800
other schools would

387
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,950
find fault with us,

388
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,590
so I went out to gather information.

389
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,310
How thoughtful.

390
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,430
Precaution is the best measure.

391
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,510
That’s my intention.

392
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,590
I’ve been

393
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,950
thinking about this.

394
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,070
They treat us as the top enemy

395
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,000
simply because they want the Nine Moves.

396
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,050
Now that the manual is destroyed,

397
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,830
they will necessarily

398
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,640
go off on us.

399
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,560
So I decide we should

400
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,830
quit this year’s Weapon Ranking Convention.

401
00:23:58,830 --> 00:23:59,590
Quit?

402
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,470
We have the unmatched techniques

403
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,070
to make the premium weapons.

404
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,400
All the schools

405
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,680
are using our weapons

406
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,000
while boycotting us.

407
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,800
We should teach a lesson to

408
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,310
these hypocrites.

409
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,920
Besides,

410
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
we forge weapons for the government

411
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,000
and thus are under its protection.

412
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,040
What can they do to us?

413
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,350
Grandpa.

414
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,540
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

415
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,950
During the Hero Assembly previously,

416
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,520
I promised all schools

417
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,880
that we would report to them

418
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,950
whatever the result would be

419
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,240
on the Weapon Ranking Convention.

420
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,040
And I should

421
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,560
walk the talk.

422
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
You don’t want people

423
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,190
to call me a promise breaker

424
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,040
when naming the Leader

425
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
of the Hall of Flames, right?

426
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,830
What’s more,

427
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,070
we are having bad reputation

428
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,590
in the martial world now.

429
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,000
As the Leader,

430
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,310
I’m responsible to

431
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,710
seize every opportunity

432
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,920
to preserve our good name.

433
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,830
What else can I do

434
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,830
if the leader

435
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,290
is determined to do something?

436
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,840
But remember,

437
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,950
you can never be careful enough.

438
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,310
Xuezhi.

439
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,760
Uncle.

440
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
I have to go now.

441
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,830
be careful, will you.

442
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,240
I’ll come back to visit you.

443
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,280
My silly girl,

444
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,070
just stay in the Hall.

445
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,820
I’ll be just fine here.

446
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,470
If you need any help,

447
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,470
turn to Tou.

448
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,270
Don’t worry, Mr. Lin.

449
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,260
I’ll take good care of Miss Chong.

450
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,830
Chief Guardian,

451
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,310
any urgent matter?

452
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,640
Young Master

453
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,830
is still alive.

454
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,470
Really?

455
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,230
You’re sure?

456
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,040
I’m sure.

457
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,280
I saw her in person.

458
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,160
It was

459
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,110
a complicated story

460
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,280
to tell you today.

461
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,940
Keep in mind

462
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,160
that only the four of us

463
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,230
know about this.

464
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,960
Don’t let the secret out.

465
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,280
Also,

466
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,640
the Weapon Ranking Convention

467
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,840
is around the corner.

468
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,920
We should pack up as soon as possible

469
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,070
and leave for Dongdu at night

470
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,950
to avoid any possible

471
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,210
traps by the traitors.

472
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,010
Only the four of us are leaving?

473
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,950
The flowers here are as beautiful

474
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,800
as they were when I first came.

475
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,880
If you like them,

476
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,640
I can prepare some seeds for you.

477
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,960
Don’t bother.

478
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,110
The flowers in the Moon Valley

479
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,950
won’t grow in the Hall of Flames.

480
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,950
Thank you for comforting my uncle.

481
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,930
It must be awkward for you.

482
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,680
The hot potato comes back again just when

483
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,210
you think you’ve finally thrown it away.

484
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,000
Why must you talk to me like this?

485
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,530
I’ve said everything that I should and

486
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,880
should not have said.

487
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,590
And

488
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,270
I don’t even know what to say from now on.

489
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,800
Why can’t we just be like when we

490
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,190
first met?

491
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,720
Those were care-free days.

492
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,880
But we are

493
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,520
different persons now.

494
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,280
Shangguang,

495
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,680
I won’t bother you anymore

496
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,440
after the Weapon Ranking Convention.

497
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,920
You’ll come back here and

498
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
enjoy your time in the Moon Valley.

499
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,890
And I will be back to the Hall of Flames.

500
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,470
Miss Chong,

501
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,380
that’s also what I ask for.

502
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,040
Leader,

503
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,070
you can’t take away the Lotus Sutra.

504
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,710
Who says that?

505
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,590
Leader,

506
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,990
Elder Yuwen ordered that

507
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,430
no one can take the Lotus Sutra away.

508
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,890
What did you call me?

509
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,400
Lea…Leader.

510
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,190
As the Leader,

511
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,310
do I need to report to anyone?

512
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,720
I apologize, Leader.

513
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,530
We were just following Elder Yuwen’s order.

514
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,070
I’ll take all the consequences

515
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
if anything happens.

516
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,350
Hurry up.

517
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,040
Chief Guardian.

518
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,880
Gugu?

519
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,400
Why is he here?

520
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
I..I think

521
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,230
he might be helpful

522
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,710
since he’s familiar with Dongdu.

523
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,000
Like last time he did help

524
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
-in the search of the manual.
-You think?

525
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,830
Have you any idea how many dangers

526
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,290
we will face along the way?

527
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,040
Leader,

528
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,760
I promise I won’t tell anyone

529
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,110
and I’ll behave.

530
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,720
Please let me come with you.

531
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,860
You take care of him

532
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,350
during the trip.

533
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
And you’ll be accountable for

534
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,800
any problem incurred.

535
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,430
Yes, Leader.

536
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,000
Let’s go.

537
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Wait.

538
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,330
Elder in chief.

539
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,470
I won’t allow the Lotus Sutra

540
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,830
to leave the Hall.

541
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,680
Why?

542
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,400
The Sutra is the only treasure

543
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,830
the Hall is left with.

544
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,630
All schools have long been coveting it.

545
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,460
If anything happens to it,

546
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,160
the Hall will never be able to

547
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,630
resume our status in the martial world.

548
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,370
I guarantee with my life

549
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,520
that I will always

550
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,460
keep the Sutra within my view.

551
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,690
Please don’t worry.

552
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,830
Yuwen Muyuan.

553
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,900
How dare you go against the Elder?

554
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,190
Grandpa,

555
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,010
you know they won’t be able to stop me.

556
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,760
Don’t put them into dilemma.

557
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,400
Sir,

558
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,920
what should we do now?

559
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,910
Ask several men to follow them quietly.

560
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,830
Deal with it

561
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,030
if anything happens.

562
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,760
Yes, Sir.

563
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,430
You, follow me.

564
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,520
Did you quarrel with your wife?

565
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,090
I’ve been a ferryman my whole life.

566
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,850
I’ve seen couples at odds making peace in no time

567
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,560
and couples being affectionate at first

568
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,620
but falling to hate each other so much

569
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,920
they want the other to fall off the boat

570
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,120
before the boat even reaches the shore.

571
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,560
In a situation like this,

572
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
couples are like the water in river.

573
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,800
Just like the clearest water doesn’t hold fish,

574
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,190
the strongest argument doesn’t win you love.

575
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,230
Women

576
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,470
are to be pleased.

577
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,350
You know that,

578
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,400
Mister?

579
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,410
The clearest water doesn’t hold fish?

580
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,590
I am just an onlooker.

581
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,470
Some fish

582
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
has never existed in my pool.

583
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,430
Then whose pool are you in?

584
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
I haven’t

585
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,430
read much.

586
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,560
I don’t get your words.

587
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,590
But

588
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,310
that’s your wife

589
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,560
and you should love her tenderly.

590
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,280
See?

591
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Your wife

592
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
is sleeping tight,

593
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,400
free of worries,

594
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,880
because you’re by her side.

595
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,760
If only we can

596
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,860
be free of worries.

597
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
Who is there

598
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,190
in your dream?

599
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,880
Young Master.

600
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
Young Master.

601
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Young Master.

602
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,520
Liuli.

603
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,360
Young Master, you’re back.

604
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,350
Young Master.

605
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,680
I thought I’d never see you again.

606
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
I’m fine, Zhu Sha.

607
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,420
How’s everyone doing?

608
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,400
All good.

609
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,280
No. Never better.

610
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,160
Miss Xuezhi,

611
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,710
they told me you were in grave danger.

612
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,590
But I knew you’d make it through.

613
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,800
Muyuan.

614
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,950
I’ve brought with me the Lotus Sutra.

615
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,950
What’s your plan?

616
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,310
Good.

617
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,880
I will make the thief confess his crime

618
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,520
in front of everyone

619
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,920
to prove our innocence.

620
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,950
OK.

621
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,280
The schools are all eyes and ears in Dongdu.

622
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,540
You should not show up.

623
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,909
I will take her to my secret mansion

624
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,600
and show up

625
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,800
when it’s a good time

626
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,360
I can handle this

627
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,320
on my own.

628
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,980
Miss Chong,

629
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,630
don’t take any risks.

630
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,639
How stupid they are to flaunt

631
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,949
the only valuable manual they’re left with.

632
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,800
Listen up.

633
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,760
On the Weapon Ranking Convention tomorrow,

634
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,840
we will push them

635
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,120
to the wall.

636
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,710
Yes.

637
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,230
What’s this place?

638
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,630
A house of mine unused for a long time.

639
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,520
Don’t you have a mansion

640
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,230
in Dongdu?

641
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,360
Why do you need

642
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,080
a shabby house

643
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,120
here at this place?

644
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,520
A nobleman

645
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,800
can be reduced to

646
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,800
an underdog overnight.

647
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,800
There is rise and fall.

648
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,430
Danger might incur fortune.

649
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:29,120
And fortune can lead to danger.

650
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,320
It is better

651
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,130
to always be prepared.

652
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,940
You don’t need to know about this.

653
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,800
You have…

654
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,470
You have Chief Guardian with you

655
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,870
to keep you from worries.

656
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,150
Don’t look down on me.

657
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,910
I

658
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,320
don’t need any help.

659
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,390
Be it from Muyuan, or…

660
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,800
Or anybody else.

661
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,080
Take a rest here please.

662
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,760
I’m going out.

663
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Where are you…

664
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,870
Suit yourself.

665
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,290
Don’t worry.

666
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,080
I’ll be right back.

667
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,910
I regret to hear of the death of

668
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,840
the Hall of Flames’ Young Master.

669
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,660
Thank you, Master,

670
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,560
Life and death are decreed by fate.

671
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,430
All forms are vanity.

672
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,000
3 months ago,

673
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,470
I promised to speak for the Hall of Flames

674
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,760
on the Weapon Ranking Convention.

675
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,060
But I’m afraid that

676
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,190
the convention

677
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,560
will not be held

678
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,670
tomorrow.

679
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:00,760
Why not?

680
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,630
All schools

681
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,040
have come to the convention

682
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,670
simply to try plotting against

683
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,520
the Hall of Flames.

684
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,470
You will become

685
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,800
the common target.

686
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,910
In this case,

687
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,710
could you please

688
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,470
say something

689
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,080
in our defense?

690
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Don’t worry.

691
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,630
Whatever people say,

692
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,800
I’ll deliver my promise.

693
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,490
Thank you, Master.

694
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,840
Merciful Buddha.

695
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,280
Master.

696
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,890
I have another favor to ask.

697
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,870
What?

698
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,880
This is the precious Lotus Sutra

699
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,350
of the Hall of Flames.

700
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,470
I’ve been keeping it with me.

701
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,390
But

702
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,790
that might be dangerous.

703
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,040
So I reckon that

704
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,000
I should leave it here at the Luduan Temple.

705
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,560
Merciful Buddha.

706
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,210
That’s not a good idea,

707
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,350
This useless man before you has already

708
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,000
failed to keep the Nine Moves.

709
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,520
We are no longer qualified

710
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,670
to keep

711
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,670
the Lotus Sutra.

712
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,730
Master, that’s not what I mean.

713
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,390
I’m not saying

714
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,520
I will deposit the manual here.

715
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,360
What I mean

716
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,730
is to leave it here.

717
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I don’t follow.

718
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,730
Miss Chong, you’re dead to the public.

719
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,800
You can’t be found out by anyone.

720
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,670
Otherwise

721
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,670
you might be killed

722
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,570
and all of previous efforts

723
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,040
will be in vain.

724
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,520
You want me to put this on?

725
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,700
Sorry that you have to do this.

726
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,190
But before the Weapon Ranking Convention,

727
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,920
you must act to be my attendant.

728
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Why are you laughing?

729
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,430
You like it?

730
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,080
It’s just…

731
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,720
I’m not quite used to it.

732
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,040
In the Book of Songs, they have lines

733
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,470
to describe “attractive smiles”

734
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,670
and “gorgeous eyes”.

735
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,000
Never mind.

736
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,870
He won’t care about

737
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,520
what I look like now.

[Hong Sheng, a bell-toller at Luduan Temple]

739
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,040
Hong Sheng.

740
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,040
You stealthily learned the evil art
and killed innocent people.

741
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,910
We won’t tolerate a vile man like you.

742
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,800
I will undo all you have learnt

743
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,090
so that you’ll never be able

744
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,520
to commit crimes.

745

[Tianbao Inn]

746
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,230
How’s it going?

747
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,360
Why are you wearing these clothes?

748
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,520
This is for her own good.

749
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,470
Muyuan,

750
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,130
how’s the plan going tonight?

751
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,240
We’ve caught the thief of

752
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,490
the Nine Moves.

753
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,390
That’s good news.

754
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,040
Miss Chong, you should go to bed early.

755
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,570
We have a big fish to fry tomorrow.

756
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,950
Shangguan,

757
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,950
where will you go

758
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,080
after tomorrow?

759
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,080
To where I should go

760
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,450
You never answer my question properly

761
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,090
every time I ask you about your whereabouts.

762
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,630
Am I really

763
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,000
that annoying to you?
