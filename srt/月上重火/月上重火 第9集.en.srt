00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 9

4
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,160
It’s indeed quite complicated between a gentleman and a lady.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,030
It is if you think so.

6
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
But it can be simple

7
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,800
if you look from a different perspective.

8
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,910
Master Shangguan, you sound sophisticated.

9
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,079
You must be

10
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
quite experienced with ladies.

11
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,190
I assume that many ladies

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
must have fallen for you.

13
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,110
Ms. Chong,

14
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,440
you overestimate me.

15
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,960
Am I not right?

16
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,440
If I am

17
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,880
that kind of man

18
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,360
you assume,

19
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,079
would you be friends with me?

20
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,079
Ms. Chong?

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,720
Aren’t you?

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,670
I don’t buy it.

23
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
You know my rules, don’t you?

24
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,750
I do.

25
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,800
Never get close to your room.

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,670
Never peep at your room.

27
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,440
Never break into your room

28
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,600
No matter what

29
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,240
Good.

30
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,550
Drunk again? You forget to close your door.

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,880
This place is indeed

32
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
a paradise

33
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,720
where you never want to leave.

34
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,080
People living here

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,630
can leave all their worries behind.

36
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,190
They can laugh and dance here,

37
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,440
leaving everything behind.

38
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,600
Winehouse of Fairyland is a place where you can buy drinks.

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,110
People come here

40
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,720
to escape from the troubles in this world.

41
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,880
But wine

42
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
can’t solve any problems.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,760
You have to face them

44
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,440
eventually.

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
These days,

46
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,320
with you being with me,

47
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,110
I don’t even need to think

48
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,790
how to protect

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,550
and to strive our sect.

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
I don’t need to think

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
where the traitors are

52
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,920
or

53
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,350
if Muyuan would get worried

54
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,600
for not finding me.

55
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,350
I feel so good

56
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,510
when I can just be myself

57
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,830
not the Young Master of Hall of Flames.

58
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,920
In my heart,

59
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,230
you’re not the Young Master of Hall of Flames

60
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,040
but the one I need to protect.

61
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,790
Now,

62
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,070
I have only one identity,

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,550
the Young Master of Hall of Flames.

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,000
I think

65
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,270
I am just a little girl,

66
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,950
my father’s little girl,

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,040
before leaving the Hall of Flames.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,920
But

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,550
my father has gone.

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,670
I find

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,790
that there is never a Chong Xuezhi

72
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,200
in this world

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
after I leave the Hall of Flames.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
There is only one witch

75
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,040
who is loathed and detested by everyone.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
If there’s a second chance,

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,920
will you wish

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,760
to be a normal

79
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,350
an ordinary girl?

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Of course.

81
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,270
When I was little,

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,950
I always hated to practice martial arts.

83
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,950
Father would punish me

84
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
if I was slacking off.

85
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,390
When he did so,

86
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,000
my uncle would come to rescue me.

87
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,270
He always said

88
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,070
that a girl

89
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,510
didn’t have to practice martial arts.

90
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,110
I can be with

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,350
a boy

92
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,720
who I like and can protect me

93
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,000
when I grow up.

94
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,070
Is this uncle you mention

95
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,760
Mr. Lin Changran,

96
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,790
who has

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,950
an impressive reputation?

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,670
Yes.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
Do you know him?

100
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,320
You can say so.

101
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Then how is he now?

102
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,390
Does he live a good life?

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,510
Him?

104
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,920
He’s quite good.

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,230
But

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,230
it’s natural for an old man like him

107
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,350
to chatter all the time.

108
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,270
Then,

109
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,230
where did you meet him?

110
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,830
At here? No way.

111
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,200
Of course not.

112
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,600
Mr. Lin never likes entertainment venues.

113
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,920
That’s true.

114
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,440
But never bring him here

115
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,270
next time.

116
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,070
He might be led astray.

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Am I so indecent

118
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,000
in your heart?

119
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,640
You might be.

120
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,440
Ever since my father passed away,

121
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,230
my uncle

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,640
also left the Hall of Flames.

123
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,790
He can’t be tracked down since then.

124
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,040
I don’t know

125
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,110
where he is now

126
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,640
or if he lives a good life.

127
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,040
What about

128
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,640
going to a place with me tomorrow?

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,390
Where?

130
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,230
Somewhere

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,790
you can find your memories back.

132
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,950
What a perfect sculpture.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
Are you waiting for Xuezhi?

134
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,270
There isn’t a second person

135
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,600
who would call me that

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,070
except you, Hongxiu.

137
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,950
Everyone says

138
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,200
that every lady would fall for you

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
but none of them ever gets your love.

140
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,110
And no one

141
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,790
has ever seen you like this,

142
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,550
being so restrained and behaving yourself.

143
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,200
You’re kidding me.

144
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,200
Ms. Chong is simple and innocent.

145
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Don’t tell her so.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,790
She will think too much.

147
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,760
I’m not kidding you.

148
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,200
I’m not that bored

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,350
to make jokes with you.

150
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,640
You’re of course

151
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,520
a person who always tells the truth.

152
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,840
Langya knows it well.

153
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
Don’t get us involved.

154
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,200
Listen.

155
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,880
It’s the fact

156
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
that you’d adore Xuezhi

157
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,030
for her perseverance and naiveness.

158
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,470
But don’t lose your

159
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,880
control with her.

160
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,960
Hongxiu.

161
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,550
You misunderstand it.

162
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,080
I only treat her

163
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,840
like a little sister.

164
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,590
A little sister?

165
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,320
Don’t play innocent.

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,710
You treat her like your sister?

167
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,550
Do you know what she thinks of you?

168
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,640
I’m afraid

169
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,080
that she won’t be a sister or a friend

170
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
if you can’t control the situation.

171
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,000
Why would you bring her

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,080
all the way here to my Winehouse of Fairyland?

173
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,200
Why would you drink with her and play the instrument to please her

174
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
while you were gathering information around discreetly?

175
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,670
And why would you introduce her

176
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,960
your best friend?

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,880
I think

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,350
you want to hook you two up.

179
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,550
Stop kidding me.

180
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,000
Don’t you know

181
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,350
what kind of person I am?

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,110
Of course

183
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,710
I do.

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,230
But I don’t think you do.

185
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,520
You don’t know yourself.

186
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,400
Do you play innocent?

187
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,440
Or are you so wise

188
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,760
that you can’t fall in love with anyone?

189
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
It’s lucky for me

190
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,790
to lose all the attachments towards anything.

191
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,760
However,

192
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
it’s miserable for you to do so.

193
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,880
Stop it.

194
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,590
Have you ever seen me

195
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,150
falling for any girl

196
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,000
for all these years?

197
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,470
I’m all alone.

198
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,400
I have witnessed enough fake love

199
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,440
and dirty tricks.

200
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,640
I was raised by my parents.

201
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,440
But actually,

202
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,030
I’m all alone.

203
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,350
It’s okay that I have to endure the lonely life.

204
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,350
It’s not okay for any girl

205
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,760
to endure such miserable life with me.

206
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,590
Maybe there’s true love

207
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,230
and unbroken vows

208
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,670
in this world.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,110
But none of these belongs to me.

210
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,230
I never wish to get what I want.

211
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,400
I only hope that I have no demands.

212
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,470
I’ve heard enough of such words.

213
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
According to you,

214
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
no one should fall in love, right?

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
I’ve been displaced for years.

216
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,670
I have no right to drag others behind.

217
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,640
So I should

218
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,550
lie to Langya, right?

219
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,910
That’s not the same.

220
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,520
You two love each other,

221
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,320
while Ms. Chong and I

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,640
are just ordinary friends.

223
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,840
Nothing more than that.

224
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Yeah, if you say so.

225
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,110
Don’t regret it in the future.

226
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,000
But you’re right about one thing.

227
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,000
All the way here,

228
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,200
I only care for her safety.

229
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,590
There is something I neglected.

230
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,030
I did

231
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,150
something extra.

232
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,640
Hope she won’t think too much.

233
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,670
We can set off now.

234
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,760
I’ve asked around.

235
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,550
There’s no other sects

236
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,200
along our way.

237
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
But be cautious

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
on your way.

239
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,400
Thank you, Hongxiu.

240
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,400
Never mind.

241
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,440
Hongxiu,

242
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,080
I have a question...

243
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,960
Don’t ask.

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
I know your question.

245
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,910
Rumors have it

246
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,550
that Shangguan Tou is a play boy,

247
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,110
that he’s proud and arrogant.

248
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,760
They’re all fake.

249
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,200
How do you know my question?

250
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
Because it’s all written on your face.

251
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,200
Xuezhi,

252
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,550
I

253
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,030
have to give you some notes.

254
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,150
He is not

255
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,960
what you think he is.

256
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,110
Every girl would fall for him.

257
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,280
But he never falls for any girl.

258
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,640
It’s hard to get close to him.

259
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,150
It’s even harder

260
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,350
to get close to his heart.

261
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,960
He won’t open his heart

262
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,080
for anyone.

263
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,550
You may not know it now.

264
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,590
In the near future,

265
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,760
you’ll get to know it.

266
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,030
Tou,

267
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,470
when will you come again?

268
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
On the day your wedding is held,

269
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
I’ll surely come.

270
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,590
My good buddy.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,350
I’m afraid

272
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,150
we can’t meet again in this life.

273
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,030
Xuezhi,

274
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,150
see you later.

275
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,550
See you.

276
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,150
Why is there lotus in the food?

277
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,440
Lotus can be used in medicines,

278
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,350
teas and cuisines.

279
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,590
All the herbs and animals

280
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,470
in the Moon Valley

281
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,640
are supplies

282
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,470
used only by us.

283
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,910
We produce our own supplies

284
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,470
and never ask for resources from outside.

285
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,350
The original intention of the Moon Valley’s foundation

286
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,200
was to build a fairyland

287
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,520
where we can seek for

288
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:47,880
peace and get rid of troubles.

289
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,080
Unlike your Hall of Flames,

290
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,110
who offers weapons to all sects.

291
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,440
It’s inevitable for you to get involved into trouble.

292
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,350
That explains it.

293
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,640
Master Shangguan,

294
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,030
is there any disciple

295
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,400
who practices martial arts?

296
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,080
They only do what should be done.

297
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,520
Our Moon Valley

298
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,400
is never restrained by rules or conventions.

299
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,880
Disciples come here

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
to escape from

301
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,520
the riots and worries

302
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,790
in the world.

303
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,200
It sounds like you.

304
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,110
Xuezhi.

305
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,200
Uncle.

306
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,700
[Deputy Leader of Moon Valley, Lin Changran]

307
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,280
Uncle.

308
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,000
Uncle.

309
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,320
Why are you here?

310
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,400
How come are you here in the Moon Valley?

311
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,710
It’s been years.

312
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,280
Uncle.

313
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,350
Where were you all these years?

314
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,200
I have been looking for you.

315
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,790
But I can’t find you anywhere.

316
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,910
I miss you so much.

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,670
Are you okay?

318
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,710
I’m fine.

319
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,640
I haven’t seen you for years.

320
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,110
Now you’re a pretty girl

321
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,440
and look like your father even more.

322
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,960
So,

323
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,470
you asked Master Shangguan

324
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,590
to protect me, right?

325
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,670
for your discreet protection for her.

327
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:46,910
Master Shangguan,

328
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,470
are you trying to persuade Ms. Chong

329
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,670
staying in Moon Valley?

330
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,670
She can make her decision

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,080
of staying or not.

332
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,110
I have another favor

333
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,110
to ask you for.

334
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,440
Please say it. Master Shangguan.

335
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
I want to trace down the traitor
of the Hall of Flames.

336
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,400
Do you have any suspects in your mind?

337
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,910
If Ms.Chong comes to a bad end,

338
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,470
the one who benefits the most

339
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,200
will be Yuwen Muyuan,

340
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,110
the former Chief Guardian of the Hall of Flames.

341
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,320
I need to investigate if he’s that traitor.

342
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,230
So,

343
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,280
deliver a message for me,

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,710
saying...

345
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

346
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,590
I wouldn’t have met you now

347
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,550
if it were not Master Shangguan,
who saved my life.

348
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,230
But I don’t understand,

349
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,520
why would you ascend the leader

350
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,760
when you know it will be arduous

351
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,280
and miserable for you to do so.

352
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,710
If you had left with me at that time,

353
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,030
you wouldn’t have suffered so much.

354
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,470
I have Muyuan

355
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,030
and the four guardians to protect me in the Hall of Flames.

356
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,840
If I leave with you,

357
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,960
what will happen to them?

358
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,030
All these years,

359
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,200
they have been protecting me and taking care of me,

360
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,640
without any complaints.

361
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,440
They do it for the goal

362
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,320
that one day, Hall of Flames

363
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,640
can make a comeback under my leadership.

364
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,310
You’ve burdened with too much responsibilities

365
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,310
that you shouldn’t share.

366
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,710
If your father knows in the heaven,

367
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,950
He

368
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,280
would only wish you happiness

369
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
and a peaceful life.

370
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:21,880
Uncle,

371
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,640
I know you love me so much.

372
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,230
But ever since my father passed away,

373
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,430
I am the leader of the Hall of Flames.

374
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,800
If I also leave,

375
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,350
who can protect the Hall of Flames?

376
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,590
You’re so responsible.

377
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,640
You’re even more responsible than me.

378
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,520
You flatter me.

379
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,310
You asked Master Shangguan to protect me.

380
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,520
Actually,

381
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,710
he found me

382
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,800
before the Hero Assembly was held.

383
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,640
Along the way,

384
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,280
if it hadn’t been him who escorted me,

385
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,590
I wouldn’t have even known

386
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,280
how to cope with these accidents.

387
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
Hero Assembly.

388
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,430
That’s when your father and I

389
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,920
came to know each other.

390
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,310
It was like yesterday.

391
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,950
Who would compete with me?

392
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,710
I would.

393
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,640
And me.

394
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,760
I’m Lin Changran.

395
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,310
I am Yuwen Yupan.

396
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,540
[Yuwen Muyuan’s Father, Yuwen Yupan]

397
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,710
I am Chong Ye of Hall of Flames.

398
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,560
Back then, the Hall of Flames

399
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,040
was invincible in the whole world.

400
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,950
But since your father passed away,

401
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,110
staying at the Hall of Flames makes me so sad.

402
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
That’s why I never came back.

403
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,470
You’ve been my only care

404
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,800
since I came to the Moon Valley.

405
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,310
So I asked Tou to protect you.

406
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,640
What a surprise

407
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,830
that he didn’t disappoint me.

408
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
All these years,

409
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,710
the Hall of Flames

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,190
has been bearing the attack from all sects.

411
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,560
Except for Sword Manor,

412
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,800
all the other sects

413
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,110
always want to wipe out

414
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,800
our Hall of Flames.

415
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,830
I don’t understand.

416
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,110
We’ve done

417
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,350
what can be done

418
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,920
to make amends in the last 5 years.

419
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,190
Why

420
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,830
would they treat us like that?

421
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,350
You shouldn’t be blamed

422
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,160
for the sins of the Hall of Flames.

423
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,590
Your father was obsessed by martial arts

424
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,640
and was a master of it.

425
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,190
He mastered Nine Moves of Lotus God.

426
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,350
But he didn’t know

427
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,350
the two manuals of Lotus Wind are complementary.

428
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,920
He only practiced the moves

429
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,230
but neglected the inner cultivation of the Lotus Sutra.

430
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
That’s why he went crazy

431
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
and killed people.

432
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,470
Then he...

433
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Then what?

434
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,590
Your father was noble and benevolent.

435
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,800
He couldn’t forgive himself

436
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,350
after he was conscious.

437
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,880
So

438
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,520
he killed himself for his sins.

439
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,350
Xuezhi.

440
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,000
Uncle.

441
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,310
I’m fine.

442
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,560
I’m

443
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
no longer that little girl anymore.

444
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,560
The tie between your father and you

445
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
is like that between your father and the Hall of Flames.

446
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,880
The grudges in the world

447
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,110
is so complicated and troublesome.

448
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,950
The more you’re involved,

449
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
the more you’ll be restrained

450
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,560
the less freedom you’ll get.

451
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
I got it.

452
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,680
I

453
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,160
will let it go.

454
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,950
There is still some time before the Weapon Ranking Convention.

455
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,190
Since you’re here,

456
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
let’s enjoy our days here.

457
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,350
Put the matters of the Hall of Flames aside.

458
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,710
We’ll discuss them later.

459
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I’ll ask Tou

460
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,470
to show you around the Moon Valley.

461
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,590
There are many landscapes here

462
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,920
in the Moon Valley

463
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,230
that you can’t see at outside.

464
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,950
Master Shangguan,

465
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,560
Moon Valley is so quaint.

466
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,160
Every leaf and branch

467
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,160
seems so sophisticated.

468
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,800
I would lose my way

469
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,430
if you were not here to escort me.

470
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,070
You’re welcome, Ms. Chong.

471
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,560
Make yourself at home.

472
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,230
I wonder how the Hall of Flames is now.

473
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,520
There are rumors about my whereabouts.

474
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Muyuan and others must be worried about me.

475
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,470
Ms. Chong.

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
Have you ever thought

477
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,230
that the one you trust the most

478
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,110
may be the one who would betray you?

479
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you mean?

480
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,950
With all due respect,

481
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,830
according to my assertion,

482
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,000
Yuwen Muyuan

483
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,920
may be the traitor

484
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,590
of the Hall of Flames.

485
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,350
Impossible.

486
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,830
We grew up together.

487
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,310
He’s like a big brother to me.

488
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,400
You may not believe in him.

489
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,590
But I know it clearly,

490
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,590
that Muyuan will never do anything bad

491
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,350
to me

492
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,280
or to the Hall of Flames.

493
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,880
Ms. Chong.

494
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,560
You’ve heard of the rumors.

495
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,760
Once your fake death was released,

496
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,800
Yuwen Muyuan ascended himself

497
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
the leader of the Hall of Flames.

498
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,280
It was so soon, don’t you think?

499
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:14,950
We can see from it

500
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,710
that he benefited the most from it.

501
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,830
Obviously,

502
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,350
he is the biggest suspect.

503
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,110
Master Shangguan.

504
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,000
You don’t know him.

505
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,190
He’s the most upright and frank person

506
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,190
I’ve ever seen.

507
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,800
And I know him better than anyone.

508
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
Anyone can be the traitor

509
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,430
except him.

510
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,920
I won’t believe a single word

511
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,040
of those rumors.

512
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,830
I got it.

513
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
Ms. Chong.

514
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,070
Cats hide their claws.

515
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,310
Yuwen Muyuan is a talent of martial arts.

516
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
How can you assert

517
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,430
that he’s willing to remain inferior?

518
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,800
What if he intends to rob your position?

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,310
He is not that kind of person.

520
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,590
He won’t take advantage of me.

521
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,000
And he promised

522
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,800
that our Hall of Flames will make a comeback with his assistance.

523
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,400
He never

524
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
eats his words.

525
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,830
We’ll see

526
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
if he is innocent.

527
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,280
I hope you’re right about him.

528
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,190
Let’s go.

529
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
I’ll show you around.

530
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,310
Master Shangguan.

531
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,590
What’s wrong with these animals?

532
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,430
They’re injured

533
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,000
but rescued by Mr. Yin Ci.

534
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,710
Mr. Yin Ci?

535
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,920
Right.

536
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,000
Mr. Yin Ci

537
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,230
is the best physician in the valley,

538
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,310
who is a master of herbs.

539
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,680
But

540
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
he is an eccentric.

541
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,110
I don’t think you’ll like him.

542
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,800
I haven’t met him.

543
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,880
How do you know I won’t?

544
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,280
You can tell when you meet him.

545
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,470
Let’s go.

546
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,070
You must be Mr. Yin.

547
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,180
[Herbal Medicine Master of Moon Valley, Yin Ci]

548
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Were those animals rescued by you?

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,760
Rescue?

550
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,310
That’s not my business.

551
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,160
Then...

552
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,430
What will you do to them?

553
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,920
I was planning

554
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,800
to cook them.

555
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,350
If so,

556
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,680
why would you rescue them

557
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,350
rather than kill them all?

558
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,310
Who are you?

559
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,400
I am...

560
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,160
This is

561
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,710
the Young Master of the Hall of Flames,

562
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,880
Chong Xuezhi.

563
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,070
Ms. Chong.

564
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,190
Do you know

565
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,280
how many kinds of poisons in the world?

566
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,280
I have no idea.

567
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Over a thousand.

568
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
Then do you know

569
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,800
how many kinds of herbs can detox the poisons?

570
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
I have no idea, either.

571
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,520
Only over a hundred.

572
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,280
Among over a hundred kinds of remedies,

573
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,000
there are 27 kinds

574
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,520
were discovered by me.

575
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,470
It’s their credits

576
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,230
that I can discover those 27 remedies.

577
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,880
So you’re not saving them

578
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,000
but testing on them?

579
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,280
It’s the best for them

580
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,880
to sacrifice their lives to save ours.

581
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,400
But your remedies

582
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,920
were gained at the expense of their lives.

583
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,590
Don’t you think it too cruel for them?

584
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,280
Mr. Yin?

585
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,040
Who do you think you are?

586
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,350
Are you lecturing me?

587
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
Calm down, Mr. Yin.

588
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,350
Ms. Chong is a green hand

589
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,040
and she doesn’t know your tests.

590
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,400
Please forgive her.

591
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,590
I’m afraid the number of the people she’s met

592
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
is much less than that cured by me.

593
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,400
You’re right.

594
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,560
Mr. Yin.

595
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,710
Actually,

596
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,430
I’m here to ask for your Poison Immune Pill.

597
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,800
What?

598
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,400
Poison Immune Pill.

599
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,160
Impossible.

600
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,400
Ms. Chong is a noble guest for us.

601
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,880
I’ll get it to her.

602
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,560
This pill was handed down

603
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,280
from Lin

604
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,160
when the valley was built.

605
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,680
There is no second one.

606
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,560
How can you give it to others?

607
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,350
Mr. Yin.

608
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,680
I know the Poison Immune Pill

609
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,950
is a treasure for you,

610
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,350
but please hand it down to me

611
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,310
since I’m the leader of the valley.

612
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,000
You can’t make this decision.

613
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,640
You can’t.

614
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,520
This pill

615
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,000
is our most valuable treasure.

616
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,040
it is the only one that exists.

617
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,710
How can you give it to others?

618
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,920
Mr. Yin.

619
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,710
I said no.

620
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,680
I would rather give it to the birds

621
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,430
than give it to her.

622
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,430
Go now. Go. Go.

623
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,470
Go away.

624
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,040
Leave me alone. Go.

625
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
I’ll get it next time.

626
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,520
Go. Go. Go.

627
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,000
Ridiculous.

628
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:09,950
Ms. Chong.

629
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,040
Please don’t overthink it.

630
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,230
You were right about me.

631
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,880
I don’t like that Mr. Yin.

632
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,520
He tests on the animals

633
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
for saving lives.

634
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
Those injured animals

635
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,830
were saved from the mouths of wild beasts.

636
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,160
He cures them

637
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
to improve his cultivation on medicine.

638
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,920
Come. Come with me.

639
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,310
What is this place?

640
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,800
This is

641
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,230
where I live.

642
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,040
Your taste

643
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,560
is indeed excellent.

644
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
We came back in a rush.

645
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
I haven’t made any preparations.

646
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
If you don’t mind,

647
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,000
You

648
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,400
can stay temporarily at this room.

649
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,110
Stay here?

650
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,070
Then where will you stay at?

651
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,520
I have somewhere to stay.

652
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,070
It’s the first time

653
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,310
that I’ve ever stayed in a man’s room.

654
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,710
Make yourself comfortable.

655
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:14,760
You’ll get used to it

656
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,040
if you stay long.

657
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,280
Take a good rest.

658
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,760
I have some errands to run.

659
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,560
I’ll leave you alone.

660
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,310
Leader.

661
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,190
How is it going?

662
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,710
I failed.

663
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,160
I’ll take punishment.

664
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,280
It’s not your fault.

665
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,950
You can never track Xuezhi down

666
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,000
if she

667
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,640
doesn’t want you to.

668
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,190
Leader.

669
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,280
Do you have other plans?

670
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,560
go and have some rest

671
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,640
Yes.

672
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,310
Excuse me.

673
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,590
Where can I find your leader?

674
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,760
He never tells us his whereabouts.

675
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,640
I don’t know either.

676
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,880
Then which room does he stay at?

677
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,160
The whole valley is his.

678
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,350
He can stay wherever he likes.

679
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,000
You’ll never know.

680
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,400
Mr. Yin.

681
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,800
Mr. Yin.

682
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,400
Is Master Shangguan in?

683
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,470
I told you

684
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,760
he’s not here.

685
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,800
He’s the leader

686
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,680
not a doctor.

687
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,710
Why would he come here?

688
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,710
He’s not here!

689
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,880
But I’ve turned the whole valley

690
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,830
upside down.

691
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,800
He must be in your place.

692
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,640
Don’t try to trick me.

693
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,800
You’re just trying to steal my Poison Immune Pill.

694
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,640
I’m not!

695
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,830
I have something to ask him.

696
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,800
What is it?

697
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,160
I...

698
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,000
I said something.

699
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,000
What about this?

700
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,070
If you see him,

701
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,950
please tell him

702
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,070
that I’ll be waiting at his room.

703
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,110
Tell him? Tell him?

704
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,160
What exactly do you want me to tell him?

705
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,880
Tell me where you will be waiting.

706
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,830
Never mind. Forget it.

707
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,710
Where will you be waiting?

708
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,280
See? You asked for it.

709
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,950
This lady friend invited here by you

710
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
makes you so annoyed.

711
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,560
Please don’t tease Ms. Chong

712
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,070
like this anymore.

713
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,310
She’s the dearest daughter of Mr. Lin anyway.

714
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
Dearest daughter?

715
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,680
She’s so reckless

716
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,590
and never wears make-up.

717
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,230
I don’t think she is dear at all.

718
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,470
I think it’s good for her.

719
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
My pill!

720
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,040
You, the leader of the valley,

721
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,230
steal my pill?

722
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,520
Mr. Yin.

723
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,400
Do you intend to

724
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,230
rob it

725
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,590
from my hands?

726
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,190
What’s more,

727
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,350
it belongs to Mr. Lin.

728
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,560
Fine.

729
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,350
Unlucky me.

730
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,830
You can have it.

731
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,070
Give it to your lady friend.

732
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,110
Go now.

733
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,710
Thank you for giving it to me.

734
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,070
goodbye

735
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,830
Leader.

736
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,230
Ms. Chong ran towards the main hall to find you.

737
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,470
Tell everyone.

738
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,830
Treat her well

739
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,230
wherever she goes.

740
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,110
Never give her a cold shoulder.

741
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,160
Yes.

742
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,950
Oh, right.

743
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,190
When will someone go for supplies?

744
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,590
He just finished it

745
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,470
and won’t be out until next month.

746
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,520
Do you need to buy anything?

747
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,350
I do need a couple of things.

748
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,560
Uncle.

749
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,190
You’re still up?

750
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,949
I can’t fall asleep.

751
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,630
So I came to see you.

752
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,469
Xuezhi.

753
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you know
why this place is called Moon Valley?

754
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,630
See?

755
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,469
The water is like a mirror

756
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,190
with the moon underneath

757
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,600
and the valley above.

758
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,360
That’s why.

759
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,080
The moon is bright.

760
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
The beauty is gorgeous.

761
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,390
Her figure is graceful.

762
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,150
I am obsessed with her.

763
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,230
Xuezhi.

764
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,150
Do you have anything in your mind?

765
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
You know it.

766
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,190
I can’t hide anything from you.

767
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,000
Of course.

768
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,760
It’s all written on your face.

769
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,390
Of course I know.

770
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,320
And

771
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,080
I think

772
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,430
it has something to do with a guy.

773
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,910
Uncle.

774
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,760
You’re a big girl now.

775
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,150
I’m so happy about it.

776
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,190
You can tell me about it

777
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,430
if you have anything disturbing you.

778
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,760
Maybe,

779
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,560
I can offer some suggestions.

780
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Uncle.

781
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,080
Tell me,

782
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,560
what is it like falling in love with someone?

783
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,430
I don’t know the answer.

784
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,230
Love

785
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,760
can not be explained with a few words.

786
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,150
No wonder.

787
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,080
You were so young

788
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,950
when I left the Hall of Flames.

789
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,430
I’ve never mentioned this to you.

790
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,870
Before,

791
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,120
I saw Hongxiu and Zhongtao

792
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,760
at Winehouse of Fairyland.

793
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,040
I was quite jealous.

794
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,390
Zhongtao said

795
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,630
that Hongxiu

796
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,190
is his only love in this life.

797
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,360
Uncle.

798
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,910
Have you ever loved

799
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,560
any girl in your life?

800
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,280
I loved one.

801
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,150
But I lost her

802
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,190
due to some mistakes of the heaven.

803
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,150
Xuezhi.

804
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
You’re the best girl in the world

805
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,470
and I’m so proud of you.

806
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,950
I should tell you

807
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,190
some things.

808
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
But I don’t want you to

809
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,950
regret it in the future.

810
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,870
If you have someone in mind,

811
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,800
and he also loves you,

812
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,870
you should

813
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,080
pursue your true love

814
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,040
and fight for it.

815
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,800
Time flies so fast

816
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,320
and this world can be so changeable.

817
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,800
Maybe in the end,

818
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,230
you can’t get what you really want.

819
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,630
But as long as you have done what you should,

820
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,150
you won't regret it.

821
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,230
More importantly,

822
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,630
you’ll come to realize gradually

823
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,320
what kind of person

824
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,520
you want yourself to be

825
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,870
after this relationship.

826
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,910
Then...

827
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,870
Then what should I do?

828
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,710
Patience. You have to be patient.

829
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,870
Time will leave you the best things,

830
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,600
but some things must be accomplished right away.

831
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,190
Because you’ll miss an opportunity while waiting.

832
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,800
Waiting or not is a kind of chance.

833
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,040
You’ll be so regretful

834
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,950
if you miss it.

835
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,560
Got it?

836
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,390
After Chong Xuezhi’s funeral,

837
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,150
Zhusha and Liuli went out discreetly.

838
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,600
They searched for something

839
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,280
at the cliff Chong Xuezhi fell down.

840
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,910
Have they found anything?

841
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,520
No idea.

842
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,320
But I think

843
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,430
they’re still searching for Chong Xuezhi.

844
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,280
Can Chong Xuezhi be alive?

845
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,600
Did you see it yourself

846
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,430
that she was torn apart by wild animals?

847
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,230
No, I didn’t.

848
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,630
I didn’t see it with my own eyes.

849
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,870
Damn it.

850
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,560
Keep a close eye on the leader and the three guardians.

851
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,150
Chong Xuezhi may be alive.

852
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:15,630
I can’t let her come back to the Hall of Flames.

853
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,600
Yes. Master.

854
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,080
Who are you?

855
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,630
What are you doing in my room?

856
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,430
Greetings, Ms. Chong.

857
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,520
I’m one of the disciples.

858
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
I’m here to deliver something to you

859
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,040
according to Master Shangguan’s order.

860
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,760
What are these?

861
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,040
He’s so thoughtful.

862
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,670
Excuse me.

863
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,910
Where is Master Shangguan?

864
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,150
He left in the early morning.

865
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,560
I don’t know where he is now.

866
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,560
Is this his clothes?

867
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,040
Are you drying his clothes?

868
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,800
Yes.

869
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,630
I have free time now.

870
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,360
I can do it for you.

871
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,000
No. No. No.

872
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,560
You’re our noble guest.

873
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,360
I can’t let you do such chores. Let me do it.

874
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,120
Your leader told me

875
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,760
to make myself home.

876
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,150
What’s the matter

877
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,150
with me doing chores at home?

878
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,910
I can do it.

879
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,080
Let go.

880
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,430
Go away.

881
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Master Shangguan.

882
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,120
Here you are.

883
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,710
Thank you, Ms. Chong.

884
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,800
One of your clothes is torn.

885
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,600
Then throw it away.

886
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,430
I never wear torn clothes.

887
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,950
That would be a waste.

888
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,080
Ms. Chong,

889
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,710
did you do such chores

890
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,360
back in your Hall of Flames?

891
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,150
I didn’t.

892
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
I have servants

893
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,150
and never have to do these.

894
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
You should never do such chores

895
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,520
given that you’re the leader.

896
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,390
If Mr. Lin knows about it,

897
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,670
he’ll scold me for it.

898
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,470
Then I’ll stop it, okay?

899
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,870
It’s late.

900
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,840
Go to bed.
