00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,520
It’s a land of idyllic beauty.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
You know Tao Qian, right?

181
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
His poem is about this place.

182
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,550
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

183
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,110
This place

184
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,370
is Xishan Sunset Peak.

185
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,450
Xishan Sunset Peak?

186
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,030
Now,

187
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,200
may you lie down?

188
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,840
You need to have a rest.

189
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,230
Be careful.

190
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,400
I will

191
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,730
cook something for you.

192
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,790
Let’s go.

193
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,700
Have a good rest, Miss.

194
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,790
Good job.

195
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,550
After Muyuan succeeds to the Leader,

196
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,850
I will promote you to Chief Guardian.

197
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,110
Thank you.

198
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,350
But

199
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,230
an accident happened.

200
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,280
What is it?

201
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,920
It’s related to Haitang.

202
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,790
When I was killing Chong Xuezhi,

203
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,520
Haitang helped her in a sudden.

204
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,900
She was unwilling to follow your orders.

205
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,260
I’m afraid she may have betrayed you.

206
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,170
I have my arrangement about Haitang.

207
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,610
Muyuan thinks highly of friendship.

208
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,520
It’s hard for him to be pacified.

209
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,790
If he is too sad,

210
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,030
it may affect

211
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,280
the accession.

212
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,150
Watch him.

213
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Tell me in time if anything happens.

214
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,080
Yes.

215
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,030
Young Master.

216
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,790
Hold me!

217
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,300
[Shining Hall of Flames]

218
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,640
Chief Guardian,

219
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Young Master doubted

220
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
that we have traitors in Hall of Flames.

221
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,400
Haitang…

222
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,140
Even if she didn’t participate in it,

223
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,640
she must have hidden something from us.

224
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,110
Waiter.

225
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,840
Here you are.

226
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,790
A pot of water, please.

227
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,280
Okay.

228
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,580
What’s going on today?

229
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,230
Got nothing.

230
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,440
I’d leave for work. Please enjoy.

231
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,030
Alright.

232
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,030
Uncle,

233
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,400
are you a hunter here?

234
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,320
Yes.

235
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,320
May I ask you for something?

236
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,350
Have you

237
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,110
ever seen a girl?

238
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,910
She’s a very beautiful

239
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,880
little girl

240
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,210
and loves smiling.

241
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,400
Who are you?

242
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,000
Why are you looking for a girl

243
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,950
in Xishan, the remote place?

244
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,280
Please take it easy.

245
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,840
She is my friend.

246
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
A few days ago,

247
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,580
she was lost near here.

248
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,440
I’ve been looking for her recently,

249
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
but I failed.

250
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,510
I wonder if you have seen her.

251
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,320
In Xishan,

252
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,770
beasts are everywhere.

253
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,840
I’m afraid it's hard

254
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,560
to get the missing one back.

255
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,430
Just leave here quickly.

256
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,910
But

257
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,400
this girl is very important to me.

258
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,090
It’s about her life,

259
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,240
so please kindly think about it.

260
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,470
If she is important, how could you let her fall down the cliff?

261
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,670
Since she is missing,

262
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,930
submit it to the will of God.

263
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,319
Just resign her life

264
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,800
to her fate.

265
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,520
Waiter.

266
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,880
Are you leaving?

267
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,560
Yes.

268
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,640
See you.

269
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,770
Fall down the cliff?

270
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,590
How could he know that?

271
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,950
This is yours,

272
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,880
right?

273
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,640
I really don’t want to suspect you.

274
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,310
So,

275
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
I think it’s necessary for you to give an explanation.

276
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,760
Haitang,

277
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,250
you came to Hall of Flames when you were seven years old.

278
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,640
We grew up together,

279
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,280
living together,

280
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,380
and practicing together.

281
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,120
Talking about friendship,

282
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,520
we are like siblings.

283
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,110
Talking about position,

284
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,430
Young Master respects you

285
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,110
and cared about you very much.

286
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,950
Why?

287
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,640
Why it’s you?

288
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,280
It’s my fault.

289
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
I tried to help her,

290
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,730
but she just got the small bag.

291
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,070
Well.

292
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,000
Then tell me

293
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,110
why the killers

294
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,070
didn't hurt you.

295
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,770
Maybe it’s because

296
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,650
only Young Master is their aim.

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,710
Good.

298
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,160
In this case,

299
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,970
we are now in front of the memorial tablets

300
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,310
of the ancestors of Hall of Flames.

301
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,710
Make a vow

302
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,110
that Young Master’s death

303
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,230
has nothing to do with you.

304
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,230
Do you dare?

305
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,710
I don’t know.

306
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,830
You don’t dare.

307
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
But I dare.

308
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,830
I will catch

309
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,350
every one of them

310
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,590
and push them off the cliff.

311
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,760
Let the wolves

312
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,710
tear their bodies

313
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,310
little by little.

314
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,680
I will let everyone in the world know

315
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,920
the punishment of betraying

316
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,190
Hall of Flames

317
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,710
and killing Young Master.

318
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,760
Of course,

319
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,950
you may be one

320
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,000
of these people.

321
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,620
Chief Guardian

322
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,110
From now on,

323
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
I don’t want to see you again.

324
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,880
Leave here.

325
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,740
[To Muyuan]

326
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,680
Be careful.

327
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,000
Here.

328
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,430
The medicine is ready.

329
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,400
Thank you.

330
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,580
Finish it before it gets cool.

331
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,000
The medicine is bitter.

332
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,280
But it’s effective.

333
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,350
Yes.

334
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,040
Uncle. Aunt.

335
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,760
Actually, I have a question.

336
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Why do you

337
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,560
live in this valley?

338
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,190
You really want to know?

339
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,470
To be honest,

340
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,190
it’s no big deal.

341
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,310
He and I

342
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,830
were martial artists

343
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,230
before.

344
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,530
In the martial arts world,

345
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,590
people may fight,

346
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,290
or kill people now and then.

347
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,190
One day,

348
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,920
our son was killed.

349
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,710
Then, we understood thoroughly

350
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,070
the martial arts world,

351
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,430
and lived here in seclusion.

352
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,590
Excuse me

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,600
for mentioning your sorrow.

354
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,880
It’s okay.

355
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,400
It’s been years.

356
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,520
We may think of him sometimes.

357
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,520
Now we’ve been relieved.

358
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,830
By the way,

359
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,000
you never talk about you.

360
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,790
You were injured those days,

361
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,160
so we didn’t mention it.

362
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,280
Did you offend someone?

363
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,980
Why did they want kill you?

364
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,310
In fact,

365
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,310
I didn’t offend anybody.

366
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,800
My name is Chong Xuezhi,

367
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,530
Young Master of Hall of Flames.

368
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,400
Since you were

369
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,110
martial artists before.

370
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,040
I believe

371
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,110
you must have heard of my father.

372
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,070
He’s Chong Ye.

373
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,270
He went mad while practicing his skills

374
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,350
and killed many martial artists.

375
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,800
Then,

376
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,060
I inherited the Leader of Hall of Flames.

377
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,760
I intended to clear Hall of Flames

378
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,400
and my father’s name

379
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,460
so that people would trust Hall of Flames again.

380
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,520
But nowadays,

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,070
many other sects

382
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,400
are eyeing Hall of Flames with hostility.

383
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,160
And also

384
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,820
some followers betrayed Hall of Flames.

385
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,590
Did I

386
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,350
say anything wrong?

387
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,350
No.

388
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,800
Miss,

389
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
it’s late now.

390
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,230
Good night.

391
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
-Uncle.
-Old man.

392
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,810
Are you alright?

393
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,310
Uncle, are you okay?

394
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,000
I’m fine.

395
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,920
It’s wound from practicing

396
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
when I was young.

397
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
My legs feel painful when it’s cool.

398
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,490
It doesn’t matter.

399
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,360
Can’t it be radically cured?

400
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,400
There is no way.

401
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,640
But

402
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
there is a herb

403
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,090
that can ease the pain.

404
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,560
It’s named tinder agaric.

405
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,680
Is tinder agaric

406
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,710
rare?

407
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,310
It’s not rare.

408
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,230
There are some on the cliff over there.

409
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,040
But

410
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,040
both Uncle Wei and I are old.

411
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,710
It’s hard for us to get it.

412
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,090
So we can only let it be.

413
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,400
Why are you telling her about this?

414
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Good night.

415
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,730
Good night, kid.

416
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,710
Be careful.

417
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,880
Brother Muyuan,

418
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,160
It’s the first

419
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,330
and only time I call you like this.

420
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,200
When you see this letter,

421
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,000
I would 've left

422
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,190
It’s my fault

423
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,400
for not protecting Young Master.

424
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,830
But I had no choice.

425
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,160
I have a twin sister,

426
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,710
named Yanhe.

427
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,230
We were orphans

428
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,210
and taken in by Elder Yuwen at our age of seven.

429
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,230
He took us back to Hall of Flames.

430
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,340
But he hid my sister

431
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,490
somewhere outside

432
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,310
and promised me only if I work for him

433
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,160
he would let us reunite.

434
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,560
Over the past years,

435
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,730
I’ve been watching Young Master for him.

436
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,470
But I can’t believe

437
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,200
he really killed Young Master.

438
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,690
Chief Guardian.

439
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,710
I’m sorry.

440
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,530
Young Master was killed because of me.

441
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,040
I’ve been secretly in love with you for years.

442
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,230
Your love for Young Master made me unhappy

443
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,190
and jealous.

444
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,190
After Young Master died,

445
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,880
I feel very guilty.

446
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,070
So I can only

447
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
die to apologize.

448
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,310
Where did you get the letter?

449
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,240
Chief Guardian,

450
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
I found it in her room.

451
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
You may leave now.

452
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,520
Yes.

453
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,330
Chief Guardian,

454
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,810
I don’t think Haitang would do harm to Young Master.

455
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,310
If it’s really her,

456
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,590
she must be forced to do so.

457
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,640
That group of people came to look for trouble.

458
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,680
It seems they would spare none.

459
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,720
It’s not like what Haitang said only one people did that.

460
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,210
Chief Guardian,

461
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,230
it feels weird outside.

462
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,810
What happened?

463
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
What’s wrong?

464
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,990
Haitang killed herself.

465
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
We found her body

466
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,520
in the hill behind.

467
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,640
When Young Master was killed,

468
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,890
you were not in Hall of Flames.

469
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,850
Where did you go?

470
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,850
Chief Guardian.

471
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,950
On that day,

472
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,190
we went to the neighboring country.

473
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,470
Any witness?

474
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,710
Yes.

475
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,280
The tavern keeper there.

476
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,310
He was there through the day.

477
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,450
Chief Guardian.

478
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,920
We leave together that day.

479
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,310
And

480
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,680
we drank a lot.

481
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,640
It’s said

482
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,000
you were out too.

483
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,520
Where did you go?

484
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,040
Tell me.

485
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,880
Where?

486
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,590
I asked him out.

487
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,020
Elder in Chief.

488
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,110
I haven’t felt well recently.

489
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,950
I’m afraid I would get the old illness again.

490
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,550
So I asked him to buy some medicinal materials.

491
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,430
Chief Guardian,

492
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,360
when will you finish questioning?

493
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,640
Now in Hall of Flames,

494
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,310
one thing is more important than finding the killer.

495
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,110
For me,

496
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,000
Nothing

497
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,160
is more important.

498
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,950
After Young Master died,

499
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,520
Hall of Flames doesn’t have a Leader.

500
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,660
Disciples are not of one mind.

501
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,490
Hall of Flames can’t go without a Leader.

502
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,430
Elder Yuchi and I have agreed

503
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,430
to choose a new Leader as soon as possible.

504
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,920
A new Leader?

505
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Elders.

506
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,640
Young Master just died.

507
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,650
We still haven’t found out the killer.

508
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,560
Now you are talking about

509
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,520
choosing a new Leader.

510
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,000
Don’t you feel

511
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,110
sorry for Young Master’s spirit?

512
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,930
Chief Guardian.

513
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,550
We do this for Hall of Flames.

514
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,430
We’ve watched Young Master growing up.

515
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,070
In our mind,

516
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,350
she's like our own granddaughter.

517
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,190
But she’s gone

518
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,800
and she won’t come back.

519
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
You have to accept the truth.

520
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,070
We’ve decide

521
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,710
to choose you

522
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,070
as the Leader of Hall of Flames.

523
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,310
You decide?

524
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,160
Be the Leader yourself.

525
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,430
Muyuan.

526
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,510
Have you ever thought

527
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,110
we were entrusted by Leader Chong Ye

528
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,490
with Chief Guardian and Elder.

529
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,650
We are responsible for protecting Hall of Flames

530
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,350
and solving the problems.

531
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,520
Hall of Flames has been at risk for the five years.

532
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,520
It’s getting worse recently.

533
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,730
Disciples are not of one mind.

534
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,310
At this moment,

535
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,400
if the other sects attack us,

536
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,160
what should we do?

537
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,350
Elder Yuchi and I

538
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,020
chose you as the Leader of Hall of Flames.

539
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,890
It’s because we want you

540
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,880
to lead Hall of Flames

541
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,340
so that everything goes well as usual

542
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,680
and Hall of Flames can stand in the world

543
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,590
with the reputation

544
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,760
regained.

545
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,190
I believe

546
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,400
this is also

547
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,860
Young Master hopes to see.

548
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,280
Chief Guardian.

549
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,350
You are the most prestige people

550
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,400
in Hall of Flames.

551
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,950
So you are obligated

552
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,950
to be the Leader.

553
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,590
All disciples.

554
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,520
Yes.

555
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,000
Chief Guardian, please

556
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,640
be the new Leader.

557
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,830
Chief Guardian, please be the new Leader.

558
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,150
Grandfather.

559
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,290
Elder Yuchi, please rise.

560
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,440
Everyone, please rise.

561
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,610
In this case,

562
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,170
I will be the Leader temporarily.

563
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,640
One day,

564
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,310
if we have a new talent capable of it,

565
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,440
I’d like to make way.

566
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,310
Okay.

567
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,210
Tomorrow is a lucky day.

568
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,520
The ceremony

569
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,080
can be held tomorrow.

570
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
As you arrange.

571
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,760
Aunt.

572
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,680
Morning.

573
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,280
Morning.

574
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Let me help you.

575
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,560
No, thanks.

576
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,110
You haven’t recovered, have you?

577
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,400
I’m already fine.

578
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,070
Look.

579
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,400
Okay.

580
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,830
Thank you

581
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,400
for saving my life.

582
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,070
Otherwise,

583
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,400
I may have died.

584
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,310
You are so beautiful.

585
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,270
Everyone would like to save you.

586
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,920
By the way,

587
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,920
I have a question.

588
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,880
Please go ahead.

589
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,310
Have you been married?

590
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,070
Not yet.

591
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,870
Then have you engaged?

592
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,040
Not yet.

593
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,170
Do you have your loved one?

594
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,190
Loved one?

595
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,760
I’m still young.

596
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,090
I didn’t think about it.

597
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,469
Aunt,

598
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,420
why are you asking about this?

599
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,120
Just a casual talk.

600
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,040
It can’t

601
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,429
be rushed.

602
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
When there is a chance,

603
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,080
it'll be okay.

604
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,870
Please do the rest of this.

605
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,470
I will go get firewood.

606
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,280
Let me do it.

607
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,390
It’s hard for you

608
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,280
and you’ve done a lot for me.

609
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
But I didn’t do anything for you.

610
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,470
Let me do it.

611
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,470
Be careful.

612
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,430
Okay.

613
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,120
I’m leaving now.

614
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,840
Be careful.

615
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,040
Okay.

616
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,230
Be careful.

617
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,000
Got it.

618
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,910
I will live here in the future?

619
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,390
Yes. It’s great, right?

620

Gugu.

621
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,850
New clothes.

622
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,440
By the way,

623
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,630
why did they kill Xuezhi?

624
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,230
Then why did they kill Haitang?

625
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,280
-Haitang was…
-Well.

626
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,800
Gugu.

627
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,080
Change the clothes.

628
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,600
Okay.

629
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,890
Why did you tell him so much?

630
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
Can you tell me

631
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,360
why Haitang was so cruel-hearted?

632
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,170
She just left us like that.

633
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,870
Maybe she thought we wouldn’t forgive her.

634
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,320
Or maybe she couldn’t forgive herself.

635
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,390
I still can’t believe

636
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,700
Haitang would kill Young Master.

637
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,120
Chequ.

638
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,670
Maybe

639
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,630
we shouldn’t

640
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,160
have told Chief Guardian about the small bag.

641
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,280
I feel something is strange.

642
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,210
How do you think?

643
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,060
[Long Standing]

644
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,910
How about the killers?

645
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,670
All silenced.

646
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,840
Nobody

647
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,190
would know this in the whole world.

648
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,390
Master,

649
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,080
Chief Guardian…

650
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:51,910
I mean

651
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,000
Leader Muyuan.

652
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,230
If he finds out

653
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,630
the truth of this matter,

654
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,710
what should we do?

655
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,350
There is no evidence.

656
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,150
How can he find out?

657
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
I’m just worrying

658
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,040
Muyuan will never rise again.

659
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,990
Maybe he can’t feel relieved

660
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,320
in a short while.

661
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,150
If he can’t get over it,

662
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,520
how can he be the Leader of Hall of Flames?

663
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,340
Spread the message

664
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,950
to let all sects know

665
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,650
that Chong Xuezhi has died.

666
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,320
The new Leader

667
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,950
is Muyuan.

668
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,560
Master.

669
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,080
If we do so,

670
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,230
all of them will know we are weak now.

671
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,320
They will eye us with hostility.

672
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,190
That’s what I want.

673
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,600
In this case,

674
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,360
Muyuan will be busy

675
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,910
with dealing

676
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,120
with other sects

677
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,710
and won’t focus on Chong Xuezhi’s death.

678
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,870
I see.

679
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,600
I will arrange it now.

682
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,800
I’m back.

683
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,080
Miss,

684
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,090
where have you been last night?

685
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,120
Aunt, I’m sorry

686
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,450
for making you worried.

687
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,710
I thought you left us.

688
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
It’s impossible.

689
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,870
I still haven’t requited you.

690
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
So I won’t leave without saying goodbye.

691
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,520
I went to a place.

692
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Where did you go?

693
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,360
I have a surprise for you.

Enter the Hall.

697
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,230
The former Leader Chong Xuezhi passed away.

698
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,870
Now Hall of Flames

699
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,130
doesn’t have a Leader.

700
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,630
From now on,

701
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,520
you will be the Leader of Hall of Flames.

702
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,670
Hope you won’t live up to people’s expectations

703
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,930
and lead Hall of Flames

704
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,230
to regain the reputation.

705
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,430
Here I Yuwen Muyuan vowed

706
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,120
to protect

707
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,910
Hall of Flames

708
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,910
with all my efforts

709
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,820
in my remaining years.

710
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,560
Leader.

711
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,630
Miss,

712
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,000
you should be able to see

713
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,800
we both

714
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,670
like you very much.

715
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,470
What a pity!

716
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,800
It’s all because

717
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,000
you are from the wrong family.

718
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,430
It’s all because

719
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,670
you are the Young Master

720
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
of Hall of Flames.

721
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,520
Miss.

722
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,690
Please don’t blame us.

723
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,190
When your father got mad,

724
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,200
he killed a lot of people,

725
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,120
including my son.

726
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,870
His name is Wei Zhen.

727
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,080
He didn’t live as old as you.

728
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,870
In martial arts world, life and death are decreed by fate.

729
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,230
But my son

730
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,710
shouldn't have died wrongly.

731
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,190
He was so young

732
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,570
and he even didn’t get married

733
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,000
before he got killed.

734
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,120
As his parents,

735
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,130
we have to take revenge.

736
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,120
Miss,

737
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,840
it's fate.

738
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,000
Please accept it.

739
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,840
From now on,

740
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,470
everyone in Hall of Flames

741
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,590
only need to do one thing,

742
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,520
finding out the truth

743
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,710
of former Leader Chong Xuezhi’s death.

744
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,910
All traitors must be strictly punished

745
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,190
to comfort her spirit.

746
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,600
Act without fail.

747
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,190
As Leader commands.

748
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,490
-Dear.
-Uncle.

749
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,800
Are you alright?

750
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,360
Uncle, are you okay?

751
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,080
I’m fine.

752
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,060
It’s wound from practicing when I was young.

753
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,430
My legs feel painful when it’s cool.

754
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,490
It doesn’t matter.

755
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,360
Can’t it be radically cured?

756
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,470
There is no way.

757
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,800
But

758
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,000
there is an herb that can ease the pain.

759
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,600
It’s named tinder agaric.
