00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,900
And The Winner is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 5

4
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,280
On the day of the Hero Assembly,

5
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,810
someone saw Chief Wang

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,240
lingering around the room where manuals were collected.

7
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,320
This is very suspicious.

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Well…

9
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,670
I’m letting you down.

10
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,600
Although I went to the same school

11
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,550
with him,

12
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,470
we had no connection

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,829
after I exit Silver Whip School.

14
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,630
I had no idea what he did.

15
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,750
So,

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,000
I’m of no help in

17
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,960
what you are investigating

18
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,190
Hey.

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,190
Send them out.

20
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,829
Wait a moment.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,829
Why are you so hasty?

22
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,190
I’m afraid that

23
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,829
you might have some secret.

24
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,470
Nonsense.

25
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,190
I have always been

26
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,079
open and above-board all my life.

27
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,390
You can’t say something like that

28
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,650
to ruin my reputation.

29
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,520
Reputation?

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,750
You just said you don’t care about

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,160
your own reputation.

32
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,600
What?

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,930
So, why did you suddenly

34
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,880
start to care about that?

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,750
If people know that

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
you replaced Wang Yinya with someone else,

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,550
I’m not sure

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,880
if you can

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,740
still maintain your reputation.

40
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,880
Non, nonsense.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,520
Nonsense?

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Okay.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Send Wang Yinya out and confront us.

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,150
After the Hero Assembly,

45
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,520
Wang Yinya didn’t return to Silver Whip School.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,250
Instead, he came to Xiangzhou.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,030
Had it not been a secret intelligence, it would be hard for me to know.

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,910
But you

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,800
introduced him

50
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,960
openly to everyone

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,320
on a full-moon-birth feast.

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,600
It seems like you’re afraid that no one

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,270
would know he’s in Xiangzhou.

54
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,710
It’s so strange you did that.

55
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,000
Except that

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,110
you had also been a part in

57
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,800
stealing the manuals.

58
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,390
Well…

59
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,670
Well…

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
So, if you

61
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,080
really want to see Wang,

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,240
then,

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,750
come with me.

64
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,880
Take care.

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,810
Watch your step.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,370
Walk slowly.

67
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,640
Why is it

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,440
so cold here?

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,830
There was a cave before.

70
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,070
I changed it to a cellar.

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,400
It’s far from the floor.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,390
So,

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,070
it’s cold here all year.

74
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,270
Aren’t you taking us to Wang Yinya?

75
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,159
Why are we here?

76
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,440
He’s inside.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,830
Please come here.

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,040
Please.

79
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,640
He’s dead.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,950
To be honest,

81
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,920
Wang Yinya

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
died two days ago.

83
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,270
How…

84
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,350
How did he die?

85
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,760
Hero Fu.

86
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,920
Can you tell us what happened?

87
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,440
Actually,

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,510
Wang and I were both confident

89
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,040
in being the master of Silver Whip School.

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,640
But eventually,

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,000
the person who became the master

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,070
was him.

93
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,230
After I left the school,

94
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,910
I came back to Xiangzhou.

95
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
I had been upset and down for a while.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,480
But it suddenly occurred to me

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,410
that I just don’t

98
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,230
belong to this world.

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
For all these years,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,720
I had had no contact

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,790
with him.

102
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,600
But two days before

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,260
my child’s full-moon-birth,

104
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,720
I got his letter.

105
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,790
It said

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,230
he would come to celebrate for my child.

107
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,920
I didn’t know his purpose.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,930
So, I had to wait and see.

109
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,760
After he

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,020
arrived at Xiangzhou,

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,070
I let him stay

112
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,510
at my house.

113
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,000
Have a drink.

114
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,440
It’s very kind of you.

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,300
Don’t say that.

116
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,440
So,

117
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
why did you

118
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
come to Xiangzhou?

119
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,230
I’m going to attend the Hero Assembly in Dongdu.

120
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,490
It’s not far from here.

121
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,160
I haven’t seen you for ages.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
I miss you a lot.

123
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,410
I’m supposed to visit you.

124
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
Listening to your words,

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
I feel regretful.

126
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,920
You’re the master of the school.

127
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,230
You must have been very busy.

128
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,230
I’m idling around.

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
I’m the one who should visit you.

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,350
Actually,

131
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,250
the reason I came here is

132
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
that I want to ask you a favor.

133
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,390
Well…

134
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You already

135
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,200
know that…

136
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,110
I quit your world

137
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,480
many years ago.

138
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,880
I have no capacity to

139
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,840
control what’s happening now.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,110
Now that you’re here,

141
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,770
I have prepared a room for you.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You can live here as long as you like.

143
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,510
Come on.

145
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,440
Have a taste of the dessert.

146
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,720
Although

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,510
I had no contact

148
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,390
with him

149
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,790
all these years,

150
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,159
I know best

151
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,159
his personality.

152
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,390
He’s cunning.

153
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,880
He pursues fame no matter what.

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
He’s aggressive.

155
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,040
He had always been trying to

156
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,070
turn Silver Whip School into a prestigious one.

157
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,070
So, he will risk anything to do that.

158
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,920
But this time,

159
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,390
the Nine Moves of Lotus God was stolen

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,940
during the Hero Assembly.

161
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,950
Although I’m not sure if

162
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,550
it’s done by him,

163
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,760
I felt weird

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,270
for his presence here.

165
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,190
But I couldn’t refuse him

166
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,030
since he said he wanted to see me.

167
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,880
But on the night

168
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,940
before my child’s full-moon-birth,

169
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,480
I went for him.

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,760
Yinya.

171
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,230
Yinya.

172
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,440
Yinya.

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,830
Yinya.

174
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,200
Yinya.

175
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,600
Do you mean he’s already dead

176
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,790
at that time?

177
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,670
Yes.

178
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
It’s the truth.

179
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,760
He came to you alive and good.

180
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,550
But he died in your house.

181
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,970
You made that up,

182
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,950
right?

183
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,270
What do you mean?

184
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,720
Although I took the different path,

185
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,000
at least we’re from the same school.

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,530
I shouldn’t be so silly to kill him in my house.

187
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,440
What’s more,

188
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,640
if I had killed him,

189
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,480
I wouldn’t mourn him.

190
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,270
So,

191
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,230
why did you secretly mourn him

192
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,000
and replaced him with someone else

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
on your child’s full-moon-birth feast?

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,270
Listen to me.

195
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,270
I found something else

196
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,830
when I found him dead.

197
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
What?

198
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,710
He had no things

199
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,880
beside him all the time.

200
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,760
One is his silver whip,

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,030
and the other one

202
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,280
is his badge.

203
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,590
When I found him dead,

204
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,040
his silver whip and badge were all gone.

205
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,590
The badge is the symbol

206
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,670
for Silver Whip School.

207
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,880
To see the badge

208
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
is to see the master of the school.

209
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
Apart from that,

210
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,230
the newly-selected master

211
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,710
shall gain this badge as well.

212
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,640
But now,

213
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,550
it’s gone.

214
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,440
If apprentices of the School know it,

215
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,370
they would be afraid and confused.

216
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,960
I had no way out.

217
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,320
I invited an anonymous

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,440
to replace him.

219
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
Hero Fu,

220
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,550
you meant well.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
But it’s not a good way.

222
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,000
Even if you can

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
temporarily hide it from his apprentices,

224
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,470
they will eventually

225
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,000
know the truth.

226
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,790
I know.

227
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,400
I was intending to

228
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,440
gain more time.

229
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,000
After I find the badge,

230
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,030
I will

231
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,110
release his death to the world.

232
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,080
So, I could maintain

233
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
the reputation of our school.

234
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,470
You just said

235
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,350
you don’t care about your reputation.

236
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,350
But now,

237
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,170
you are suddenly protecting your school’s.

238
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,830
Of course, I care about that.

239
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,760
You’re the master of Hall of Flames.

240
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,030
Don’t you know that?

241

Hero Fu.

242
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,380
Did you find out

243
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,200
who killed Wang Yinya?

244
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,590
I’m ashamed.

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,230
I checked carefully

246
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,760
his body after he died.

247
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
I found no superficial injuries

248
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,460
and internal ones.

249
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
I had no clues.

250
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,440
I really don’t know

251
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,550
who killed him.

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,150
No superficial injuries

253
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,350
and no internal ones?

254
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,470
Do you mind

255
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,350
me having a check?

256
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,910
Please.

Aren’t you in Dongdu?

Why are you here?

264
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,230
I’m afraid he would learn nothing

wandering in streets.

266
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,670
So, I brought him along.

you’re such a kind person.

Master Shangguan,

354
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,200
you are a kind man,

355
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
it’s enough.

356
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,440
You can’t decide your own identity.

357
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,320
Don’t be worried.

358
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,150
Actually,

359
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,110
I’m not worried about this.

360
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,960
Now that Wang Yinya died,

361
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,550
the chain of evidences broke here.

362
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,400
Nine Moves of Lotus God was gone.

363
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,400
I’m afraid the world is going to be in chaos.

364
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,150
As Young Master

365
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,910
of Hall of Flames,

366
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,840
I really think

367
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,320
I’m inept.

368
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,440
Actually not.

369
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,790
We haven’t investigated

370
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,650
the reason of Wang Yinya’s death.

371
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,080
You don’t need to console me.

372
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,110
You have done

373
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,030
enough for me.

374
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,350
Look at that.

375
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
It’s so beautiful.

376
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,470
Come on.

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,200
You’re just

378
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,960
like the crystal,

379
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,450
pure and sparkling.

380
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,810
I hope you can stay in winds

381
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,560
and never fall into the dirt.

382
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No matter how dark

383
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
the night gets,

384
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,090
you’ll still shine like this firefly.

385
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,610
It’s just like the hope we have in our life.

386
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,350
Don’t be

387
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,230
upset and discouraged.

388
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,150
You’re right.

389
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,400
Even if

390
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,280
this little fire fly

391
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,280
is trapped in my hand,

392
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,670
it still

393
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,590
shines vaguely.

394
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,640
I won’t give up either.

395
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,550
I’ll find out the manual.

396
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
After you find it,

397
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,230
what’ll you do?

398
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,150
I’ll revitalize our palace,

399
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,590
and become a Young Master

400
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,200
no one can look down upon.

401
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,880
What about you?

402
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,910
What’re you going to do

403
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,790
in the future?

404
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,960
Me?

405
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,200
Have a guess.

406
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,350
You have

407
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,200
such superior martial arts

408
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,030
and good reputation.

409
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,000
I can’t

410
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,910
think of that.

411
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,520
Some things

412
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
are limited by one’s ability.

413
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,000
Some things

414
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,730
are designed by one’s fate.

415
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
If you wake up one day,

416
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,230
and you find that everything around you

417
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,010
is just fantasy and illusion,

418
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,740
what’ll you do?

419
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,760
Have you had any difficulties?

420
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:15,710
If you need a hand,

421
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,920
please tell me.

422
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,230
Although I’m weak in martial arts,

423
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,589
I’ll definitely do it for you

424
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,000
no matter what.

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,859
No matter what?

426
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,069
Why?

427
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,420
Because you helped me.

428
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,320
You can’t help me resolve

429
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,810
everything as you wish to.

430
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,310
But remember that

431
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
you promised me.

432
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,730
You’ll give something

433
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,950
most important to you

434
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,560
after you find the manual.

435
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
I did.

436
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,000
You can take anything you want from me.

437
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,190
I won’t regret it.

438
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,590
Cheju,

439
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,880
why don’t you have any reactions?

440
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,340
And you don’t like to talk,

441
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,920
just like wood.

442
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,590
I’m wood.

443
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,800
But can you tell me

444
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,690
when did you enter Hall of Flames?

445
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,800
And what have you learned?

446
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,920
Tell me.

447
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,350
Tell me.

448
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,430
Wood.

449
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,160
Wood.

450
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,920
Master.

451
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,710
Did you have a good talk

452
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,590
with Xuezhi?

453
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,590
I had intended to report something to you.

454
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,040
But seeing you two so sweet together,

455
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,430
I thought I can’t bother you.

456
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,110
What do you want to report?

457
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,430
The opponent is a professional.

458
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,880
Leaving no trace of flaws.

459
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,400
Any news about Wang Yinya's

460
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,800
Silver Whip and badge?

461
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,680
No.

462
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,560
Master.

463
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,420
What happened?

464
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,800
Your sister knows that you are in Xiangzhou

465
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,160
and she asked me to invite

466
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,430
you there tomorrow

467
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,040
I see.

468
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,110
Go back and tell her

469
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,170
I will go tomorrow.

470
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,920
Master.

471
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,680
She knew

472
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,400
you are with a girl.

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,880
She asked you to take the girl

474
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,230
together to her palace tomorrow.

475
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,560
I’ll excuse myself now.

476
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,220
Master Shangguan.

477
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,690
How did your sister know we are together.

478
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Xiangzhou is the realm of Lord Lu.

479
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,880
My sister is his wife.

480
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,640
It was normal that she knew.

481
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,070
That is Lord Lu.

482
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,950
Hurry up.

483
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,610
Be careful.

484
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,350
Let's go.

485
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
Lord Lu is supervising everyone's work.

486
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,680
He does not fear the bad weather.

487
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,280
Instead, he sets an example.

488
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,230
It's not easy.

489
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,110
Come here, Tou.

490
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,950
Your highness.

491
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,950
Tou.

492
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,560
Your highness.

493
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Please sit down.

494
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,290
Sit down.

495
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Sister.

496
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,230
Look at you.

497
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,310
I haven't seen you in a few days

498
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,760
You are also a lot thinner.

499
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,880
If it's too tired outside,

500
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,950
come home.

501
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,800
You have no idea

502
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,590
how worried your family stayed after you left?

503
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,200
You don’t need to be worried. I ’m good.

504
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,190
Oh, yeah.

505
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,560
Why

506
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,950
is Lord Lu absent?

507
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,100
He went to inspect the dam.

508
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,280
There are days of heavy rain. The emperor sent a message

509
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,040
to let him supervise the dam reinforcement

510
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,400
I see.

511
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,660
Looking at you closer,

512
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,330
you are more beautiful.

513
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,950
What is your full name?

514
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,470
Chong Xuezhi.

515
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,840
Young Master of Hall of Flames, Chong Xuezhi?

516
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,950
You have heard of the Hall of Flames?

517
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,310
It’s famous in this world.

518
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,160
I've heard about your name before.

519
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,190
But the impression of Hall of Flames

520
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,310
has changed

521
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,390
because of your presence today.

522
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,230
Unexpectedly, the Young Master of Hall of Flames

523
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,950
criticized by the world

524
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,680
is such a delicate girl.

525
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,040
Tou, what do you think?

526
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,710
Yes.

527
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,280
I’m flattered.

528
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,560
Since you are a friend of Tou,

529
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,710
then you don’t have to be so formal.

530
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,520
Call me sister as well.

531
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,680
Yes, sister.

532
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,040
Relax.

533
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,880
Sister, I saw the beautiful flowers outside

534
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,310
in the way here.

535
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,640
Did you care for them?

536
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,350
Yes.

537
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,760
When I am free,

538
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,190
I plant flowers and plants with my husband.

539
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,710
You like it too?

540
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,070
Then I will ask the maid

541
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,000
to take you for a walk in the garden.

542
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:40,920
Ok.

543
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,710
Tou.

544
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,950
Why are you with people from all over the world?

545
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,110
What’s more,

546
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,310
it’s the controversial Hall of Flames.

547
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
What I did

548
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,430
was just to complete a task

549
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,560
given by others.

550
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,880
In fact,

551
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,520
I like her.

552
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm just worried about you getting involved in the disputes.

553
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,880
Since I can retreat from the hall,

554
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,830
naturally, I won't get involved

555
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,680
in the muddy waters of world.

556
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,160
You didn’t need to worry about me

557
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,310
Tell me.

558
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,230
Do you have a crush on that girl?

559
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,190
You should know,

560
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
you are about

561
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,190
the age of marriage?

562
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,560
I am always thinking about it.

563
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,230
Sister.

564
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,230
There are still many unfinished things.

565
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,350
It’s too early

566
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,640
to mention this.

567
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,310
Never mind.

568
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,520
I can't control you anymore.

569
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,560
Take it into consideration.

570
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Come on.

571
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,110
Sister, have some tea.

572
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,160
Master Shangguan.

573
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,880
Your sister is really thoughtful.

574
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,830
She also arranged a carriage to take us back.

575
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,920
She is afraid that it will rain and we have nowhere to hide.

576
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,280
Your sister has a very good relationship with you.

577
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,000
But…

578
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,220
Why didn't you want to see her before?

579
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,770
Because of Lord Lu,

580
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,290
I just hope my sister will be safe and happy in this life.

581
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,520
She is now a princess consort.

582
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,950
Why isn’t she happy and safe?

583
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
The royal family

584
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,640
is filled with lies and desires for power.

585
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,430
How can she be happy?

586
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,800
Emm…

587
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,380
Why did your sister marry King Lu?

588
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,920
At that time,

589
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,030
there were many famous people to come to marry her.

590
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,550
But my elder sister didn't take any one.

591
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,640
She just fell in love with this one.

592
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,070
He’s not so smart.

593
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
He also has no support in the family.

594
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,520
Having listened to you,

595
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,800
the royal family

596
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,410
is much more dangerous than my world.

597
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,830
The point is

598
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,280
you can retreat from this world and live in isolation.

599
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,640
But as a royal member,

600
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:23,010
he can never stay away from disputes.

601
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,830
You don't seem to like Lord Lu.

602
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,230
Can't say I like it or not.

603
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I don't know well.

604
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,890
As long as my sister likes it, I’m okay.

605
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
Some people also said that our Shangguan family

606
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,070
attaches to the great.

607
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,070
They’re afraid it's for

608
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,230
the power balances.

609
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,230
If this is the case

610
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,910
she really sacrifices herself.

611
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,430
It has been raining for three months

612
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,470
non-stop.

613
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,800
It can ruin these crops.

614
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,070
God.

615
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,070
Spare us.

616
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,680
who live a life by the sky.

617
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,470
If you are hanging out,

618
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,590
be careful.

619
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,920
Don't go to the Twelve Channel.

620
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,470
Thank you for reminding.

621
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,470
You are definitely not from Xiangzhou.

622
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,600
-No. We’re…
-How do you know?

623
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,280
I saw how two of you dressed.

624
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,160
I knew you came from Dongdu.

625
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
I've been working here for decades.

626
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,160
You two

627
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,720
are really like married couple.

628
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,110
We are misunderstood.

629
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,590
Why don't you explain?

630
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,000
No harm.

631
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,280
Why should we get angry?

632
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,830
You…

633
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,160
I lived in a noble family since childhood.

634
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,710
I often share the carriage with the boudoirs of the nobility.

635
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,520
We were often treated as arranged betrothal of minors.

636
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,350
But,

637
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,520
after adulthood,

638
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,110
this is the first time to share a carriage with a woman.

639
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,280
The seafood we ate today is quite fresh.

640
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,950
But,

641
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,190
this place is not close to the sea.

642
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,720
How is the seafood shipped without spoilage?

643
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,160
It’s simple.

644
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,270
They’re shipped with ice cubes.

645
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,920
Coachman.

646
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,920
Let’s go to Fu Yiya’s mansion.

647
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,590
Okay.

648
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,040
Didn’t You two

649
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,760
already checked my brother's body?

650
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,290
Why should you check again?

651
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,040
You said that day

652
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,590
there were no superficial or internal injuries.

653
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,430
Then this is strange.

654
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,590
Theoretically,

655
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Wang is a master of martial arts.

656
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,710
There should be very little pain.

657
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:57,560
Sudden death is only possible because of the murder.

658
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,280
If you are hurt, you will leave traces.

659
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,070
Why did he leave no trace?

660
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,230
In fact,

661
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,520
there are many masters in martial arts.

662
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,230
Someone can kill you in one move

663
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,680
without leaving any scars

664
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,880
After a few days.

665
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,330
the wound will gradually become visible.

666
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,190
But three days have passed since the last inspection.

667
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,790
Why didn't we find anything?

668
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,670
Its’ because of this perennially cold cellar.

669
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,760
It can not only slow down
the decay of the body.

670
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,580
At the same time, it can also delay
the time for the wound to appear.

671
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,430
It's just like

672
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
the seafood delivered by coachman.

673
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,610
They are kept fresh with ice cubes.

674
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,560
I found it.

675
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,350
No, no, what is this wound?

676
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,800
Like a petal.

677
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,370
Nine Moves of Lotus God?

678
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,810
This is impossible.

679
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,800
Nine Moves of Lotus God?

680
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,090
Isn’t this your unique martial art in Hall of Flames?

681
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,190
It was your people

682
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,450
who killed my brother.

683
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
Someone?

684
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,430
Take this demon girl down.

685
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,680
I trusted you

686
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,880
and let you examine his body.

687
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,180
How should I forget it?

688
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,800
You’ve had a long grudge against him.

689
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,190
Come here, take them down.

690
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,880
Wait.

691
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,920
The Nine Moves of Lotus God is the manual of Hall of Flames.

692
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,190
But except my father,

693
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,790
no one else has control of it.

694
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,160
Besides, your brother Wang Yinya died with this scar.

695
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,640
It means that the thief has already begun to practice it.

696
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
Go on, just make up it.

697
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,760
How can someone practice

698
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,350
the Nine Moves of Lotus God so quickly?

699
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,920
Although it is difficult to practice,

700
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,190
those with high internal strength

701
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,800
can also practice to the third move in a short time.

702
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
What I said is absolutely true.

703
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,640
As a leader,

704
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
you can’t even protect your manual.

705
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,310
I can't believe what you said.

706
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,760
You.

707
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,880
Fu Yiya.

708
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,750
Please think carefully.

709
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
If we are really murderers,

710
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,800
can we be so stupid to come here?

711
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Come here?

712
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,560
You two just are

713
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
deliberately trying to kill me, right?

714
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,400
Are you?

715
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,880
Are you OK?

716
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,350
Fu Yiya.

717
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,230
How dare you hurt her?

718
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
No, Master Shangguan.

719
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
You can't talk nonsense.

720
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes, you hit me.

721
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,760
I didn't hit the leader.

722
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,400
Right?

723
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,660
How about this?

724
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,520
That’s all for today.

725
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,800
Go,

726
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,560
in case I would hurt you in a while.

727
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,520
What happened after

728
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,680
what you told me?

729
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,070
I don’t know yet.

730
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,310
Look at that.

731
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,040
Now these young couples are…

732
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,470
-How are they cuddling together openly?
-Gosh.

733
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,710
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

734
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,520
Master Shangguan.

735
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,430
This is still daytime

736
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,830
Put me down.

737
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,830
You are hurt.

738
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,590
Don't move.

739
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,000
Everyone is here.

740
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Look at that?

741
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,740
Are you better now?

742
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,830
Young Master, are you okay?

743
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,630
Young Master.

744
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm fine.

745
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,640
Leader, what happened?

746
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,000
The thief already practiced

747
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,260
the third move of Nine Moves of Lotus God.

748
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,280
But why did

749
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,920
this man kill Wang Yinya?

750
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,950
Maybe Wang Yinya already knew his identity.

751
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,190
So, he was killed.

752
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,110
Is it possible that

753
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,270
two people are already enemies?

754
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,430
Not so likely.

755
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,800
Is it possible that

756
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,790
Wang Yinya stole the manual and come to Fu Yiya?

757
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,860
Fu Yiya wanted to take the manual.

758
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,070
So, Fu killed him.

759
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,590
It’s absolutely impossible for Fu Yiya

760
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,790
to practice the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

761
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,800
I think the person

762
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,760
who stole the secret,

763
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,690
is above us, whether it’s martial arts or age.

764
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,880
But now Wang Yinya is dead.

765
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,880
There is no clue.

766
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,850
You don't have to sigh.

767
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,350
Maybe there is a clue that can help us.

768
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,350
Wang Yinya's Silver Whip and badge.

769
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,350
Yup.

770
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,800
This person took away

771
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,760
Wang Yinya's Silver Whip and badge

772
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,790
definitely for other plans.

773
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
But,

774
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
what is it then?

775
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,800
Sell them to make money?

776
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,370
Defamation?

777
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,800
What?

778
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,600
To prevent others from investigating himself

779
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,240
and creating false evidence to frame others.

780
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,840
I think you are right.

781
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,040
I didn't expect you to say that

782
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,370
since you look like wood all the time.

783
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,190
From tomorrow,

784
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,920
we will start investigating from these two things

785
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,400
OK.

786
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,640
Fu Yiya now has doubts about us.

787
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,670
He will definitely watch us.

788
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,070
Don’t be exposed.

789
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,890
He is the most proper

790
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,190
person to do it.

791
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,210
Sister, why are you looking for me?

792
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Gugu, I want to give you a task.

793
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,430
Starting from tomorrow,

794
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,920
help me look for two things

795
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,590
One is Wang Yinya’s badge,

796
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,460
another one is his Silver Whip

797
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,880
I got it.

798
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,640
Young Master.

799
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,740
There is someone sneaking there.

800
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,830
Tan Yi of the Shangqing Sect.

801
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,830
Don't go.

802
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,290
Zhusha.

803
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,160
But he saw us.

804
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,980
It’s ok.

805
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,760
We didn’t do anything bad. We don’t need to be afraid to be seen.

806
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,310
It seems

807
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,330
we’re not the only ones here in Xiangzhou.

808
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,230
I knew that they are here.

809
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,350
They may already have clues.

810
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,760
Don't act rashly.

811
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,560
Yes.

812
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,710
Master.

813
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,710
Shall we

814
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,930
continue to spy?

815
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,280
Definitely.

816
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,280
I must find the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

817
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,630
No one wants to get ahead of me.

818
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,710
Yes, master.

819
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,190
Father.

820
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,230
Xiangzhou is really lively now.

821
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,260
We really didn't come in vain.

822
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,389
Everyone is planning something.

823
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,639
While staring at Chong Xuezhi,

824
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,250
you also need to know the actions of each school and sect.

825
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,320
Yes.

826
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,380
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

827
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,870
Zheng.

828
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,050
Your Highness, aren’t you tired?

829
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,360
You work so hard.

830
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,430
No.

831
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,200
It’s hard for the disaster-hit people.

832
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,680
Your Highness, have a seat.

833
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,400
By the way,

834
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,860
today I invited Tou to come to the mansion as a guest.

835
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,630
Tou?

836
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,970
He came to Xiangzhou

837
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,230
to visit you?

838
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,950
No.

839
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,630
He is with the Young Master of Hall of Flames

840
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,960
to deal with something.

841
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,230
Isn't Tou not dealing with people

842
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,080
from the martial world?

843
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,760
I am also curious.

844
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,910
So, I sent someone to inquire.

845
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,560
I heard that it seems that the Hall of Flames lost its manual.

846
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,760
This matter makes it very difficult

847
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,390
for the Hall of Flames.

848
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,320
As for why Tou joins in.

849
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,410
I do not know either.

850
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,830
The dispute in martial world

851
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,510
sounds pretty interesting.

852
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,000
Your highness.

853
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,380
This is a letter from his Royal Highness.

[To Lord Lu]

What does the Prince say in the letter?

856
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,080
He asked if i need help?

857
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
Help me reply to him.

858
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,060
that his kindness was received by me.

859
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,530
I still have other arrangements.

860
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,230
Please don't worry about me.

861
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,840
