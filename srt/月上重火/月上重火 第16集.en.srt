00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 16

4
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,270
Fengzi.

5
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Fengzi.

6
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,480
Do you want to eat something?

7
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,160
Qingmei.

8
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,230
Fengzi has been listless since she’s back.

9
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,910
She even locks herself up.

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,060
What’s wrong with her?

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,110
She's never been like this.

12
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,800
Is she sick?

13
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
She is

14
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
hurt by love.

15
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,620
Leave her alone and chill out.

16
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
Hurt by love?

17
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,110
Don’t ask

18
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,440
too much about it.

19
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,500
Master Shangguan.

20
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,970
Where have you been

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
this year?

22
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,910
I went to Emei first,

23
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,000
and then

24
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
went back to Imperial Advisor’s Mansion.

25
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,520
Did you get anything?

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,720
I found out my background identity at Emei.

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
At that time,

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,750
I let go of the grudge

29
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,450
and tried to contact my father,

30
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,000
I found

31
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,390
he wasn’t that filthy or aloof

32
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,910
as I thought.

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
During that time,

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I had wondered

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,390
what decision

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,670
I’d make if I were him.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Later,

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,630
I found

39
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,600
I could seemingly understand him.

40
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
That’s great.

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,670
Miss Chong.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,830
In the future,

43
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,550
I will open my heart,

44
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,089
and try to experience this world,

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,390
and try to

46
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,790
love others.

47
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,500
Master Shangguan.

48
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,830
You know.

49
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,950
If you had let go of the grudge

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,480
when we first met,

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,670
would it be

52
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,620
a different ending for us?

53
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
What is the smell?

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
My medicine!

55
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,830
Let me do it.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,830
Leader.

57
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Chequ.

58
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,950
What brings you here?

59
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,200
Leader. Bad news.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,110
Chief Guardian is infected with the epidemicflu.

61
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,880
He locks him up in the room

62
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,920
and refuses to see anyone.

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
How come?

64
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,350
Elder Yuwen asked you to go back right now.

65
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,000
OK.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,830
Go ahead.

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,640
Go.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,920
Fengzi!

69
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,760
Fengzi!

70
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,240
-Qingmei.
-Feng...

71
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,790
What’s going on?

72
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,350
Master.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,790
I’ve been knocking the door,

74
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,250
yet she doesn’t answer me.

75
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
In the hall,

76
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,270
I had found Fengzi looked weird.

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
Tell me honestly.

78
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,960
Are you hiding anything from me?

79
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,510
She encountered

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Shangguan Tou

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,890
and they quarreled.

82
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,480
For what?

83
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Shangguan Tou told her not to look for him anymore,

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,540
and drove her away.

85
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,510
Shangguan Tou did that thing

86
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,480
in Sword Manor,

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,940
yet Fengzi still thinks about that bastard.

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,390
Fengzi.

89
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,000
Fengzi.

90
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
Go away.

91
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Fengzi!

92
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,880
Fengzi!

93
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Fengzi!

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,000
Stay away.

95
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,760
She may have contracted got the epidemicflu.

96
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,270
Fengzi! Fengzi!

97
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,110
Wake up!

98
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,230
Wake up!

99
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,110
But I heard that

100
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,320
no people in Shark Sect

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
contracted this disease.

102
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,830
It’s said they have one kind of secret medicine,

103
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,920
the Green Spring Elixir.

104
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,790
The Green Spring Elixir?

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,010
Go and call a doctor!

106
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,000
Stay away from me.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Muyuan.

108
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,409
How come you are infected?

109
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,159
Perhaps on my way back.

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,440
Muyuan.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,390
Rest assured.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,230
I will definitely

113
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,880
find a way to cure you.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,200
Xuezhi.

115
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,320
Remember.

116
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,670
Zhusha has been in charge of

117
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
the routine training of disciples.

118
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
Chequ is in charge of

119
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,670
the weapon forging.

120
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,640
If you have any question,

121
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
go to consult the two elders.

122
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Maybe I can no longer help you.

123
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,350
Muyuan.

124
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,390
Stop talking.

125
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,770
I can surely find you the cure.

126
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,000
It’s my fate.

127
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,480
You can’t help me.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,200
You promised

129
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,750
you’d restore the Hall of Flames for me.

130
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,230
We still have two years.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,230
If you dare to leave me and the Hall of Flames,

132
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,550
we will not spare you.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,230
Alright.

134
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,670
I will

135
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,159
hold on until Xuezhi is back.

136
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,600
Hang in there.

137
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,070
I’m sure I will find the cure for you.

138
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Be safe.

139
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,480
Leader. Leader.

140
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,390
We’ve figured it out.

141
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,440
The epidemic is no natural disaster,
but man-made.

142
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,200
Man-made?

143
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,160
We went to several severely-struck villages,

144
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
and found the poisonous centipedes

145
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,480
in the body of local poultry.

146
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,040
The centipedes spread it to the poultry,

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,300
the poultry to humans.

148
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,790
Exactly.

149
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,270
It is so vicious

150
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,160
and outrageous.

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,790
and outrageous.

152
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,040
Who did this?

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
I assume

154
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,160
the poisonous centipedes probably

155
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
have something to do with Divine Spirit Temple.

156
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, I’m going to Divine Spirit Temple.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,760
Leader.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,730
Divine Spirit Temple is a cult.

159
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,669
They have all kinds of poisons there

160
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,760
as well as traps.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,230
You’ll be in danger

162
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,470
if you go alone.

163
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,549
Don't worry.

164
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,280
Man Feiyue can do nothing to me.

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,960
With my current power,

166
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,159
they are not my match.

167
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,910
You two stay here

168
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,080
and take care of the Chief Guardian.

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,550
Be sure to keep close to him.

170
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,350
-Yes.
-Yes.

171
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,410
Greetings, Mr. Tie.

172
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,030
Be seated, Mr. Xia.

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,200
You come to my Shark GangSect.

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
What is your purpose?

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
I’ll get to the point.

176
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,400
The epidemic

177
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
wreaks havoc now.

178
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,640
I heard Shark Sect has the miraculous medicine

179
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,230
named the Green Spring Elixir

180
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,830
which can cure the epidemic.

181
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,710
I come

182
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,080
for the elixir.

183
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,550
Green Spring Elixir

184
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,400
is the ancestral elixir of my Shark Sect.

185
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,000
If not necessary,

186
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,840
even I won’t use it.

187
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,670
Mr. Xia.

188
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,520
It’s arrogant of you.

189
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,200
What makes you think

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,150
I will give you the Elixir?

191
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,200
If not necessary,

192
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,530
I wouldn’t have made this request rudely.

193
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,110
But all sects

194
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,990
have disciples infected with the disease.

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,280
If you don’t help them,

196
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,530
all the sects are going to suffer.

197
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
Mr. Xia.

198
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,910
Since you come for my elixir,

199
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,840
don’t make these high-sounding excuses.

200
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,440
My leader

201
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,880
sent me here.

202
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,840
The elixir

203
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,710
is used to save my leader's daughter,

204
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,840
Ling Fengzi.

205
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,230
The Sword Manor needs your favor now.

206
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,030
If you can help us,

207
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,490
we will remember your kindness for good.

208
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,520
Given my manor’s influence

209
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,790
in the world,

210
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,110
if you need anything in the future,

211
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,640
we’ll surely help you.

212
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,960
Mr. Xia.

213
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,350
This reason

214
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,400
is acceptable.

215
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,670
However,

216
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,790
Lin Zongxing is supposed to

217
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,710
beg me in person.

218
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,110
He wants to save his daughter,

219
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
while he just sends a disciple here.

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,440
He looks down on me,

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
doesn’t he?

222
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,840
My leader wanted to come.

223
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
It's just that...

224
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,840
Say no more, Mr. Xia.

225
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,080
tell Lin Zongxing.

226
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,330
If he comes to beg me in person,

227
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,550
I will give him the elixir

228
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,150
to save his daughter.

229
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,520
Mr. Tie.

230
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Listen to me, Mr. Tie.

231
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,230
Mr. Tie.

232
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,550
Sir.

233
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
When did you come?

234
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,040
Stop being pretentious.

235
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,840
Let me tell you.

236
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,110
I don’t want to come.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,260
Hadn’t your attendant forced me to come,

238
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,050
I wouldn’t have been here.

239
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,030
It’s for your sake.

240
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,250
Or else, I’d have beaten him up.

241
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,230
I’m telling you, Shangguan Tou.

242
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,520
The epidemic is so serious outside.

243
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,840
If I die here,

244
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,860
I won’t spare you even if I get become a ghost.

245
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,590
You're joking, sir.

246
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,640
Given your capability,

247
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,910
you wouldn’t be infected

248
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,960
even if I were.

249
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,030
However,

250
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,080
this epidemic is very serious.

251
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
We count on you.

252
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,840
I’ll have Wuming stay outside the clinic.

253
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,500
Tell him if you need anything.

254
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,590
Cut it out.

255
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,160
Take me to have a look.

256
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,080
This way.

257
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,960
I doubted you long ago.

258
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,370
You think I don’t know what you did?

259
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,240
I sent you to put the poison,

260
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,370
yet you trampled all my centipedes to death.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,640
No.

262
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,750
The centipedes I put weren’t in this color.

263
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,590
You are arguing with me!

264
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,200
I pitied on those girls.

265
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,760
The disciples of Emei Sect are all women.

266
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,360
It’s such a pity to kill them.

267
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,960
The epidemic will be over sooner or later.

268
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,690
Why not let them live more days?

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,910
I’m deeply moved.

270
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,350
But

271
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,280
I've sent others to do it.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,590
You still have a chance

273
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
to see them die.

274
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,790
Guards!

275
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,760
Yes.

276
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,550
I’ll test my new poison on him.

277
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,960
Take him down.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,710
Yes.

279
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,350
Leader! I...

280
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,790
Move!

281
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,710
Leader!

282
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,110
Leader!

283
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Are you looking for this?

284
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,790
Did Lin Zongxing also order you

285
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
to steal the Green Spring Elixir?

286
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,640
Mr. Tie.

287
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,170
Don’t blame my master.

288
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,120
It’s all planned by myself.

289
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,470
Fengzi's life is at stake.

290
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,150
I had no choice.

291
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,440
I’ll announce

292
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,790
what you did

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,110
to the whole world tomorrow.

294
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,230
What do you think?

295
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,260
I don’t care about my reputation.

296
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,440
I just want to save Fengzi.

297
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,880
Mr. Tie.

298
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,960
I beg you.

299
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,110
Please help me.

300
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,570
It’s about her life.

301
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,550
A rat like you

302
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,030
is useless for me.

303
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,550
Scram.

304
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,440
No.

305
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
I have to

306
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,840
get it today.

307
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,030
Go away.

308
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,570
Where have you been, Qingmei?

309
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
What did you feed her?

310
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,990
The Green Spring Elixir.

311
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,680
The Green Spring Elixir?

312
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,360
How come you have it?

313
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,220
I went to the Shark Sect

314
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,050
and got it from Mr. Tie.

315
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,030
Qingmei.

316
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,160
You saved Fengzi’s life.

317
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,360
I’ll keep it in mind.

318
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,960
We... We are

319
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,230
fellows.

320
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,010
I should do this.

321
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,710
I owe Tie Xiao

322
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,550
a favor as well.

323
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,150
I’ll pay him back in the future.

324
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,790
Master.

325
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,110
There's only one elixir.

326
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,030
She had it.

327
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
We need to

328
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,250
figure out another way for other disciples.

329
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,790
We found out this epidemic

330
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,470
could be made by the Divine Spirit Temple.

331
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,070
I must go and investigate it.

332
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,520
OK. I’ll go with you.

333
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,400
No.

334
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,440
You’ve passed all your inner strength to me.

335
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,670
If you’re in danger,

336
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,150
I’m afraid I can’t protect you.

337
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,200
I’m helping my father by doing this.

338
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,760
If we can find out the culprit,

339
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,550
I can have an explanation to my father.

340
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,230
Besides...

341
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,520
What?

342
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,640
Besides you and me,

343
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
another two old friends will go with us.

344
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,550
Old friends?

345
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
Hongxiu.

346
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,910
Zhong Tao.

347
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,840
Xuezhi.

348
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Miss Chong. Long time no see.

349
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,230
How come you are here?

350
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,880
The Baldy asked us to come.

351
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,710
But then again,

352
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,430
Baldy rarely asked us

353
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:07,640
for help.

354
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,520
I thought Tou would come alone.

355
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
I didn’t expect

356
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,569
he’d have a beauty with him.

357
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,109
You two...

358
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,310
What?

359
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
There must be something going on between you two.

360
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,310
Tell me the truth.

361
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,950
Hongxiu has keen eyes.

362
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,430
Of course.

363
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,710
But

364
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,280
it has been so long,

365
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,590
and you two just come this far.

366
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,000
Shangguan Tou.

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
You let me down so much.

368
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,030
Hongxiu, you don't understand.

369
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,400
A steadfast and unshakable relationship

370
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,650
is worth waiting, no matter how slowly

371
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,800
it develops.

372
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,170
I understand Baldy.

373
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,470
Because both of us know

374
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,920
how it feels

375
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,210
to love someone.

376
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,590
Am I right, Baldy?

377
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,400
I believe in Tou.

378
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,560
You are just

379
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
glib-tongued.

380
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,470
My love to you never changes.

381
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,830
Two lovers.

382
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,030
Shall we hit the road?

383
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,230
Right. Right.

384
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,310
Over there.

385
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,230
Let’s go.

386
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,230
Go.

387
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,680
Leader.

388
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,680
This is the new poison I made.

389
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,830
Only one drop

390
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
will make your veins and bones atrophy

391
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,400
and kill you by pain.

392
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,070
Yes.

393
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,040
Leader.

394
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,950
It looks wonderful.

395
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,350
One more.

396
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Feng She.

397
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,680
Come here.

398
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,710
This poison

399
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
works very well.

400
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,240
You should take the credit.

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Now

402
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,040
it’s your turn.

403
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,590
No.

404
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,760
No.

405
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,000
Looks like

406
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,020
the poison isn’t working.

407
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,710
Leader.

408
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,540
What you fed me wasn’t poison!

409
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,760
Feng She.

410
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,760
I raised you up.

411
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,040
How can I

412
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,320
poison you to death?

413
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,000
However,

414
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,920
you are useless.

415
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,400
Useless things

416
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,970
should be thrown away.

417
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,640
You vicious woman!

418
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,350
Kill me!

419
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,230
Don’t worry.

420
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,710
Looks like

421
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,630
the poison isn’t potent enough.

422
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,280
Feng She.

423
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,520
You're lucky this time.

424
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
You aren’t dead.

425
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,060
I'll give you another chance.

426
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,430
As long as you listen to me,

427
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,520
I’ll leave you alive.

428
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
It’s enough.

429
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,470
Am I not good to you?

430
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,760
I’m tired of

431
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,680
poisoning people

432
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,560
and being loathed!

433
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,110
Kill me!

434
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,000
I just want to be an ordinary man.

435
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,640
You?

436
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,830
Ordinary man?

437
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,830
Feng She.

438
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,640
You were not born ordinary.

439
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,770
Do you know who your father is?

440
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,310
The chief of Huashan Sect,

441
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,950
Feng Cheng.

442
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,880
Feng Cheng?

443
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,560
Did you know who your mother is?

444
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,070
An unknown village girl.

445
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,190
At that time

446
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,190
I was a physician.

447
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,160
You

448
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,520
were delivered by me.

449
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,160
I sent you to Huashan Sect,

450
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,520
yet Feng Cheng didn’t want you.

451
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,590
You are a bastard.

452
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,880
You have no right

453
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,400
to be an ordinary man.

454
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,040
Is Feng Cheng my father?

455
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,640
Father?

456
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,950
Am I Feng Cheng’s son?

457
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,920
It’s too late for you

458
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,680
to know the truth.

459
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,920
Feng Cheng is my father.

460
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,710
Today

461
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
you won’t leave here alive.

462
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:05,920
Miss Chong.

463
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
I feel

464
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,130
something is not right.

465
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,520
You are right.

466
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,960
The Divine Spirit Temple has many enemies.

467
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,590
Considering Man Feiyue’s style,

468
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,250
she’d definitely be on guard.

469
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,310
Langya, Hongxiu.

470
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,400
Back us up.

471
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,590
Miss Chong.

472
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,080
Hongxiu, watch out!

473
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,430
Are you all right?

474
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,430
What about you?

475
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,320
Are you worried about me?

476
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,800
I am not. In your dreams.

477
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,470
Langya.

478
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,560
Are you alright?

479
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,230
I’m fine.

480
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
-Go.
-Go.

481
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,400
Mind your step.

482
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,130
Look out, Hongxiu!

483
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,310
Are you OK?

484
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,640
Are you alright?

485
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,160
I’m fine.

486
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,190
Go.

487
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,470
Let's go.

488
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,310
Leader.

489
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,590
Leader.

490
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,310
Shangguan Tou and Chong Xuezhi and two people

491
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,560
have got through the Misty Forest

492
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,920
and the Poison Arrow Formation.

493
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,380
They are about to break in.

494
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,630
Shangguan Tou and Chong Xuezhi?

495
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,950
Let them die.

496
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,240
Poison them to death.

497
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,160
Leader.

498
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,360
The two of them are not afraid of poison.

499
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,590
They

500
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,090
haven’t tasted my fierce poison.

501
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,560
Go.

502
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
Turn on the trap

503
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
and lead them to the dungeon.

504
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,800
Yes.

505
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
Let me out!

506
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,400
Go.

507
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,760
Let me out!

508
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,640
Let me out!

509
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,470
Beauty!

510
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,280
It's you!

511
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,190
Come here!

512
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,400
Get me out! Get me out!

513
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,160
Hurry.

514
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,190
I remember you.

515
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,000
You poisoned

516
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,040
Huashan’s disciples on the Hero Assembly.

517
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,160
Your name is Feng...

518
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,220
Feng She. Feng She.

519
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,590
Aren't you Man Feiyue’s disciple?

520
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,190
How come you’re locked here?

521
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,350
She asked me to poison the Emei Sect.

522
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,210
I didn’t want to do the dirty work.

523
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,640
So, she trapped me here.

524
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,010
She also meant to test her poison on me

525
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,440
to see how soon I will die.

526
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,450
They are thugs.

527
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,740
Don’t believe him.

528
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,680
I am not a thug.

529
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,800
I’m not like her.

530
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,090
Leave him alone. Let's look for the exit.

531
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,590
Exit?

532
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,830
Only entrance but no exit here.

533
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,920
What do you mean?

534
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,640
Try to go back if you don’t believe me.

535
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,240
You can’t go out definitely.

536
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,350
How can we get out?

537
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,710
Tell me

538
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,280
why you came here first.

539
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,470
We're looking for Man Feiyue

540
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,270
to get the cure for the epidemic.

541
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,710
Get me out.

542
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,190
I’ll lead the way to find her.

543
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,710
You are her disciple.

544
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,400
Why should we trust you?

545
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,230
You may not trust me.

546
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,830
But

547
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,160
I don’t think

548
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,800
that man has enough time.

549
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,640
What do you mean?

550
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,430
He’s hit by a poisoned arrow. Didn’t you know it?

551
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,470
Were you hit by a poison arrow?

552
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,830
No... No...

553
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,530
Right on his wrist.

554
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,710
Let me see.

555
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,230
You...

556
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,470
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,250
It’s a small wound.

558
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,980
It doesn’t matter.

559
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,070
Langya.

560
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,230
You shouldn’t keep it from us.

561
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,830
Looking for the cure is the big deal.

562
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,230
I don’t want to delay you to be encumbered by me.

563
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,190
You’re underestimating

564
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,070
the poison of the Divine Spirit Temple.

565
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,070
The small wound

566
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,190
will kill him.

567
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,640
Is there a cure for this?

568
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,470
Yes.

569
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,640
I’ve been living here since little.

570
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,900
I know this place like the back of my hand.

571
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,590
Fine. Feng She.

572
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,640
We can get you out.

573
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,430
But you have to heal my brother's hand first.

574
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,070
Second,

575
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,680
take us to Man Feiyue.

576
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,070
If you can get these two things done,

577
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,650
I’ll reward you with handsome money.

578
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,920
Great! Great!

579
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Deal. Deal.

580
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,490
Beauty. Unlock it. Unlock it.

581
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,310
Thank you, beauty.

582
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,230
Lead the way.

583
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,070
Follow me.

584
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,050
This is the poison workshop

585
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,640
where we make the poisons.

586
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
Poison workshop?

587
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,280
Where is the antidote workshop?

588
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,880
No.

589
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
We only make poisons, no antidotes.

590
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,040
But the poison on his hand

591
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,640
is commonly used by our sect.

592
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,470
The disciples are often hurt by it mistakenly.

593
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,730
So, it’s exceptional.

594
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,440
Give me the antidote now.

595
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,620
Don’t touch it.

596
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,400
The centipedes are extremely poisonous.

597
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,060
Don’t get yourselves killed.

598
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Tell us

599
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,830
about these centipedes.

600
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,110
These poisonous centipedes

601
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,770
are the media of the epidemic.

602
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,680
Poultry eat the poisonous centipedes.

603
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,740
Human eat poultry.

604
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,570
Human contact each other.

605
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,540
One spreads to tens and hundreds.

606
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,760
It’s truly the trick of Divine Spirit Temple.

607
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,470
Indeed.

608
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,710
Since I learned the power of these centipedes,

609
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,640
I’ve never bred centipedes again.

610
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,730
Why did the Divine Spirit Temple do this?

611
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,490
I don’t know.

612
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,000
We just follow the orders of the Leader.

613
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,740
That’s it. Let him take it.

614
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,060
It stinks. Is it the antidote?

615
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,190
Curing the illness with poison,

616
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,650
most ingredients are the same as the poison.

617
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,470
If you dare to lie to me,

618
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,730
I’ll cut your head off.

619
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,760
Let him take it.

620
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,020
This dosage isn’t enough if it gets late.

621
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,950
Langya.

622
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,470
It smell so bad.

623
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Is it for human?

624
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,160
You wanna die? Hurry.

625
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,210
Langya. How do you feel?

626
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,520
What’s going on?

627
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,830
How are you?

628
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,160
Much better.

629
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,430
Look.

630
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,370
I didn’t lie to you.

631
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,760
Alright. I’m leaving.

632
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,470
Stop.

633
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,350
WhereTo to where?

634
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,480
Where is Man Feiyue?

635
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,800
She’s over there.

636
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,260
Go to find her yourselves.

637
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,110
Stay with us

638
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,760
until we find her.

639
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,350
Feng She.

640
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,190
You haven’t gotten your reward.

641
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,350
You wanna leave?

642
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,410
Master Shangguan.

643
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,760
Please let me go.

644
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,350
It isn’t about money.

645
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,950
I don’t want to see her again.

646
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,560
You...

647
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,070
Miss Chong.

648
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,470
Let him go.

649
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:08,950
Go.

650
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,070
Young Master of the Hall of Flames.

651
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,400
What brings you here?

652
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,280
Don’t you know it?

653
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,310
Your Divine Spirit Temple

654
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,110
makes poisons and kills people.

655
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,160
The epidemic wreaks havoc.

656
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,760
The people suffer.

657
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,280
It’s all because of you.

658
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
So what?

659
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,060
Why are you doing this?

660
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,280
Chong Xuezhi.

661
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,680
Let me ask you.

662
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,160
When you were mocked

663
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,710
and isolated

664
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,470
in the Hero Assembly,

665
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,710
how did you feel?

666
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,070
Aggrieved?

667
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,070
Humiliated?

668
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,640
Or desperate?

669
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,850
None of your business.

670
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,640
Our Divine Spirit Temple

671
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,300
is known as a cult in the world.

672
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,760
People throw mud at us

673
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,160
for all evil things.

674
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,630
We are at the same stateposition

675
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,220
and have similar stories.

676
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,070
Perhaps

677
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,000
you can understand my feelings.

678
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,310
Cut the crap.

679
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,720
Give me the antidote.

680
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,920
The epidemic has no cure.

681
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,090
I’ve never meant to make antidotes

682
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,520
when I bred the centipedes.

683
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,830
I don’t believe

684
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,190
any of your word.

685
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,090
No more talking.

686
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,460
Only by subduing her will she tell us.

687
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,560
Stop them!

688
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,400
Run! Run!

689
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,190
Scumbags!

690
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,310
What now?

691
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,470
Fight or not?

692
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,040
Alright.

693
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
I will give you the antidote.

694
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Hongxiu!

695
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,600
I'm fine.

696
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,560
Chase.

697
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,080
Go.

698
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,080
Let's go.

699
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,010
-Chase.
-Chase.

700
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,210
Hongxiu, look out!

701
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,000
Langya.

702
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,360
Langya, how are you?

703
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,040
Freeze!

704
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,360
Are you alright?

705
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,429
I’m fine.

706
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,409
Langya is poisoned!

707
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,630
Give me the antidote!

708
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,600
Antidote?

709
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,840
It isn’t on me.

710
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,810
Where is it?

711
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,840
Take us there.

712
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,690
In the poison workshop.

713
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,910
Go.

714
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,230
Langya.

715
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
They’re going to get the antidote.

716
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,960
They’ll be back soon.

717
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,800
Hang in there.

718
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,870
Please. Hang in there.

719
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,400
Hongxiu.

720
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,720
So many bottles. Which one?

721
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,230
The copper pot.

722
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,230
Watch out!

723
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,630
Watch out!

724
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,800
Langya!

725
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,910
Langya.

726
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,230
Hongxiu.

727
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,430
It won’t work.

728
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,190
No.

729
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,600
Langya, stop talking.

730
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,710
Don’t talk.

731
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,390
They are going to get the antidote.

732
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,360
Hongxiu.

733
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,520
I, Langya,

734
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,300
have meet you in this life.

735
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,150
-Langya.
-It’s worth it.

736
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,910
Langya.

737
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,910
Stop talking.

738
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,190
Not the next life.

739
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,470
I told you

740
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,560
we’d have a long life.

741
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,410
I don’t allow you to die.

742
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,840
Don’t die.

743
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,710
I...

744
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,360
I want to get some sleep.

745
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,910
No!

746
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,760
No, Langya! Don't sleep!

747
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,040
Wake up! Wake up!

748
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,670
Don’t sleep! Don’t sleep!

749
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,630
I beg you!

750
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,390
Langya.

751
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,910
I don’t allow you to sleep! Langya!

752
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,760
Too bad.

753
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,530
The only clue to find the cure is gone.

754
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,390
Not exactly.

755
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,120
Do you think only the Lleader

756
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,720
knows the antidote formula?

757
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,520
I know it, too.

758
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:38,840
I secretly

759
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,370
kept the formula in my mind.

760
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,930
Now the Divine Spirit Temple is gone.

761
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,540
I have no concern any more.

762
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,760
Would you go to the Hall of Flames with me

763
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,160
to prepare the antidote?

764
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,190
Alright.

765
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,570
Anyway, I have nowhere else to go.

766
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,840
We’re going home.

767
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,520
Chief Guardian.

768
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,580
Time for medicine.

769
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,990
Hasn’t the leader come back?

770
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,560
Not yet.

771
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,560
Whether she can get the cure or not,

772
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,760
I only hope she can come back safe.

773
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,930
Chief Guardian.

774
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,870
You should get recovered first

775
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,730
and then go to welcome the leader.

776
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,300
Take your medicine first.

777
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,630
Liuli.

778
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,680
How is the disciples’ training

779
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,040
going?

780
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,060
Everything goes well.

781
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,000
What about

782
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,150
the weapon forging by Chequ?

783
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,630
It goes well.

784
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,460
-And...
-Chief Guardian.

785
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,190
All the things in the Hall

786
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,840
are taken care by Elder Yuwen.

787
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,710
Rest assured.

788
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,920
Take care of your health.

789
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,630
Sure.

790
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,230
You may go to work.

791
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,600
Here.

792
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,470
Is it hot?

793
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,710
Fengzi.

794
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,000
You nearly scared me to death.

795
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,950
Didn't you know how dangerous the epidemic is?

796
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,870
You’d die

797
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,790
if you couldn’t be cured.

798
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,630
I’m fine, father.

799
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,600
It’s all my bad.

800
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,320
I’m sorry.

801
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,710
Were

802
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,870
other disciples

803
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,470
infected with the epidemic?

804
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,520
Silly girl.

805
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,670
You nearly died,

806
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,560
and you still thought of others.

807
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,490
You... Alas.

808
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,460
Shangguan Tou is ungrateful.

809
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,320
I won’t forgive him.

810
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,950
It’s not his fault.

811
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,080
How could you say that?

812
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,670
Fengzi.

813
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,190
Did you know

814
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,600
who saved your life?

815
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,840
It’s Father, not you?

816
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
I’m useless.

817
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,710
It’s Qingmei.

818
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,800
Qingmei?

819
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,050
Qingmei went to the Shark Sect

820
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,960
and got the Green Spring Elixir

821
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,430
and saved your life.

822
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,910
Fengzi.

823
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,730
Whether you listen to me or not,

824
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,190
I want to tell you

825
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,330
that you should think about it carefully.

826
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,600
Who

827
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,360
has been by your side when you are happy

828
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,670
or upset?

829
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,400
Who has been pleasing you

830
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,800
and helping you?

831
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,800
Who was it

832
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,090
that tried all means desperately

833
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,870
to save you

834
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,400
when your life was at stake?

835
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,000
That is

836
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,190
the man you should cherish

837
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,630
for the rest of your life.

838
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,560
Fengzi.

839
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,000
Let go of the unrealistic fantasies.

840
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,280
Check off all the swords here.

841
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

842
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,000
Fengzi.

843
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,320
What brings you here?

844
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,570
Come. Let me see if you get better.

845
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,320
Much better.
