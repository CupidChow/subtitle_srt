How come here're so many bubbles?

6
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,800
Mr. Yin,

7
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,440
uh,

8
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,190
where do these bubbles come from?

9
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,080
What is it?

10
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,390
You asked me?

11
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,520
I’m standing out here just like you.

12
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,880
How am I supposed to know?

13
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,340
Would there be any danger?

14
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
No.

15
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,410
I gotta go inside and check it out.

16
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,320
Do you think

17
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,410
it’s okay for you to go inside?

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,110
You and I had better

19
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,240
stay here and watch.

20
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,079
But...

Miss Chong.

22

Miss Chong.

23
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,640
Miss Chong, are you okay?

24
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,829
I’m okay.

25
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,800
Let’s proceed.

26
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,110
What?

27
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
What?

28
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
Where’s my gift?

29
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,880
Oh, about the gift...

30
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,230
I wanted to

31
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,200
buy a nice and expensive

32
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,670
gift for you,

33
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,760
but I didn’t have enough money.

34
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
So I went to gamble

35
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
to win more money to buy a better one

36
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,180
for you to give Zhusha.

37
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
She will be delighted.

38
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,600
And then what happened?

40
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
I lost all the money.

41
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,600
-You lost all the money I gave you...
-Calm down, calm down.

42
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,930
Sit down. Just sit down.

43

Come on, sit down.

44
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,230
Don’t worry.

45
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,970
I’ll win your money back. Plus the interests.

46
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,350
I’ll make sure Zhusha gets the gift.

47
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,810
Do you have more money.

48
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,720

What’s wrong with...

54

What’s wrong with Master Shangguan?

55
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,390
He just came back from the herbal spring.

56
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,590
He looks much better.

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,390
Good.

Miss Chong...

61

Miss Chong seems feeble.

62
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,640
A lot of her inner power

63
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,730
has been consumed these days.

With the stimulation of the herbal bath,

65

77
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,710
that we look like a pair of birds in difficulty?

78
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,370
I don’t want to be in difficulty with you.

79

Great.

84

We’ll always travel together.

We’re free. No restraint.

86
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280

someday

and you’ll no longer be the Leader
of the Hall of Flames,

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,670
we’ll just be

91

an ordinary couple.

92
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,150

Nothing. Nothing at all.

99

I saw it.

100
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,350
Give it to me.

Master, I...

102
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,010
These bracelets...

103
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,350
I bought them under the mountain today.

104
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,910
You were planning

105
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,490
to give them to Fengzi ?

107
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,680
I have something to ask you.

108
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,510
Please be honest with me.

109
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,030
Ask away.

110
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
I’ll be honest.

111
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,840
Do you have feelings

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
for Fengzi?

113
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,790
Yes.

114
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
Don’t you mind?

115
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:47,910
Master,

116
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,170
I love Fengzi wholeheartedly.

117
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,150
I genuinely like her.

118
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,880
I don’t mind her past.

119
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
Good.

120
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Very good.

121

Qingmei,

122
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,960
do you know

123
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,670
that that thing

124
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,470
has always been bothering me?

125
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,320
Master.

126
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,520
I’m always worried about her marriage.

127
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,110
Master, don’t worry.

128
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,640
My love for Fengzi is true.

129
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,640
Qingmei,

130
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,550
you’ve been practicing here for many years.

131
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,200
You’re a good man

132
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,170
and a great martial artist.

133
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,760
I’m aware of your love

134
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,520
for Fengzi.

135
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,400
OK, then.

136
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,840
If Fengzi says yes,

137
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,380
I’ll allow you two to get married.

138
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,760
Then

139
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,590
I’ll be relieved of a major concern.

140
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,550
You

141
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,760
have my trust.

142
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,770
Thank you, master.

143
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,640
Arise.

144
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,400
I’ll take the pair of bracelets

145
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,590
to Fengzi.

146
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,880
I’ll ask her what she thinks

147
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
by the way.

148
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,030
OK.

149
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Fengzi.

150
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,200
Dad,

151
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,110
why are you here?

152
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,450
Come on, come on.

153
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,790
Come and sit.

154
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,880
Daddy.

155
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,280
It’s late.
Is there anything that you want to talk to me?

156
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
It’s only a small matter.

157
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,200
I was thinking

158
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
that you and I

159
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,060
haven’t sat down
for a conversation for a long time.

160
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,520
Fengzi.

161
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,350
Your mom died very early.

162
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,210
It’s always been me taking care of you.

163
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,470
As a man,

164
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,880
I’m not that sensitive.

165
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,840
Now that you’re in your early 20s,

166
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,470
you’re old enough to get married.

167
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,270
I want to listen to your thought.

168
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,710
Daddy,

169
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,790
what do you suddenly bring this up for?

170
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
A grown-up woman
is not supposed to stay at home for too long.

171
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,770
You’ll marry someone sooner or later.

172
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,760
Tell me,

173
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,730
what kind of man do you like?

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
Can’t you

175
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,200
read me through?

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,840
Fengzi.

177
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,350
Don’t you know what kind of a man

178
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,550
Shangguan Tou is?

179
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,440
Appearance doesn’t matter the most

180
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,150
when you pick a husband.

181
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,910
The most important thing is
whether he’s dependable.

182
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,350
Shangguan Tou has a bad reputation.

183
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,960
He’ll cheat on you eventually.

184
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,910
He can’t give you a stable life.

185
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,530
Oh, look.

186
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,480
Where do these come from?

187
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,980
Aren’t they looking nice?

188
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,190
Qingmei bought them for you.

189
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,030
He’s just too shy.

190
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,200
Fengzi,

191
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,230
what do you think of Qingmei?

192
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
He...

193
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,350
He’s been nice to me.

194
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,970
He takes care of me.

195
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,110
But

196
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,640
I never thought...

197
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Fengzi.

198
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,840
I don’t ask too much of you.

199
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
I just wish you can

200
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
marry a dependable man.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,590
I brought Xia Qingmei up.

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,900
I know clearly about his love for you.

203
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,080
Although you never
paid too much attention to him,

204
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,110
his love for you

205
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,410
has never changed over the years.

206
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,640
As a father,

207
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,890
I don’t expect that you become rich or anything,

208
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,670
I just hope that you’ll live a happy life.

209
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,530
That your love will last forever.

210
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,150
I’m getting older.

211
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,790
One day,

212
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
I’ll be too old to love

213
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,150
and spoil you.

214
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,000
By then,

215
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
only Qingmei

216
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,640
will be able to take care of you.

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,030
Dad.

218
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,030
Allow me

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,470
to mull it over, please.

220
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,640
No rush. Just think it over.

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,710
It’s OK. Put them on.

222
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,230
Sir.

223
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,320
What took you so long?

224
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,080
I was delayed by something

225
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,520
a few days ago.

226
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
Uneasy mind

227
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,850
leads to flawed result.

228
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,840
Too many earthly trivialities

229
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,910
are bad for your inner practicing.

230
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,440
You’re right.

231
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,670
If I achieve nothing,

232
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,150
my problem will never be solved.

233
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,910
From today on,

234
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,670
I’ll quit these meaningless thoughts.

235
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,670
I’ll focus on practicing.

236
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,640
I haven’t got the chance to enjoy the moon

237
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,470
so leisurely like this for ages.

238
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,630
What’s on your mind, Xuezhi?

239
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,520
I’ve been out for more than half a month,

240
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,080
I wonder what’s happening
in the Hall of Flames now.

241
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,550
It’s been a long time since the last time

242
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,920
we intruded the Divine Spirit Temple.

243
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,080
I can’t help but feel this thing

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,320
hasn’t ended yet.

245
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,890
There must be a larger conspiracy

246
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,200
behind the malaria.

247
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,580
When I’m in good shape,

248
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
I’ll help you find it out.

249
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,520
I, too, hope that

250
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,040
you can recover sooner

251
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,349
so that

252
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,760
I can get rid of

253
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
you sooner.

254
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,000
Once you’re stuck with me,

255
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
you’ll never be able to

256
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,069
get rid of me.

257
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,640
Oh.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,130
Any news from Winehouse of Fairyland?

259
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,359
How is Hongxiu doing?

260
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,160
After burying Langya,

261
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,280
she went back to Winehouse of Fairyland.

262
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,160
But

263
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,650
she’s been unhappy ever since.

264
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,000
Tou,

265
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,400
do you think

266
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,760
Hongxiu will get married again?

267
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
I don’t know.

268
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,000
But

269
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,590
I understand her.

270
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,710
It’s lucky for someone to

271
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,760
get a person

272
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,270
that they truly love.

273
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,310
No one can replace the person.

274
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,310
Even if she got married with someone else,

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,980
it doesn’t mean she’d forget Langya.

276
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,680
Life sure is full of uncertainty.

277
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,070
Last minute,
you think you can be together forever.

278
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,920
The next minute,

279
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,560
two people are separated from each other.

280
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,590
Right.

281
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,800
That’s why

282
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,190
people need to learn to

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,140
cherish the one they have.

284
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,680
Don’t regret

285
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,160
when you lose the person.

286
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,590
Sometimes,

287
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,310
you wait and wait,

288
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
then you miss out.

289
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
My uncle

290
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,950
told me this before.

291
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,590
Really?

292
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,470
Mr. Lin is quite sentimental.

293
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,950
Xuezhi.

294
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,370
Both of us have lost the closest ones.

295
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,110
Fate has

296
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,350
put us together.

297
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,950
I believe,

298
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,800
in the future,

299
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,110
that no matter how great the pain is

300
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,840
or how many miseries there are,

301
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,400
I can be cured by your smiles.

302
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,840
You’ve cured not only my injury

303
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,160
but also my heart.

304
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,000
I’m not that perfect.

305
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,310
The night is

306
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,000
really beautiful.

307
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,920
Tou.

308
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
I seem to have understood

309
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,310
what my uncle said.

310
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,880
So? What do you think of the ore?

311
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,000
The purity is high.

312
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,310
The content is OK.

313
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,040
Where did you find such a quality ore?

314
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,780
Well, it’s an interesting story.

315
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,350
Hey, cut the crap.

316
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,920
I found this

317
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,230
on the mountain at the back
of the Hall of Flames.

318
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,160
There seems to be a large iron mine.

319
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,050
Why did you go there?

320
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,400
And how did you coincidentally

321
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,070
find the iron mine?

322
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,540
Come with me and check it out
if you don’t believe me.

323
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,180
How about we go see it with him?

324
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,280
If what he says is true,

325
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,350
the materials for the second half of the year

326
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,480
will be guaranteed.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Fine. Lead the way.

328
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
We’ll go with you.

329
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,110
Good. Let’s go.

330
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
Come on, come on. In there.

331
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,580
Come on. Follow me.

332
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,680
Quick. Quick.

333
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
Feng She, where is it?

334
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,310
Chequ, isn’t this a common cave?

335
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,570
Where is the iron mine?

336
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,720
In there. Right over there.

337
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,630
Keep going. Let’s check it out with him.

338
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,920
Come on. Here.

339
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,310
Here?

340
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,110
Right. Here.

341
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,710
Why-why is it so deep?

342
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,110
You two go down.

343
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,640
What about you?

344
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,590
I’ll be waiting for you here.

345
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,520
Call me if you need me.

346
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,320
We can watch each other’s back.

347
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Slow down.

348
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,190
Feng She, slow down.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,530
Feng She.

350
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,280
OK, OK.

351
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,680
Slowly.

352
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,830
Zhusha. Slowly, slowly.

353
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,070
Zhusha, are you OK?

354
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,110
I’m fine.

355
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,160
Good.

356
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,520
Feng She.

357
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,160
Is the iron mine

358
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
that you talked about truly in this cave?

359
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,830
Yes. Around there.

360
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,800
Look for it.

361
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,680
Feng She.

362
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,070
Feng She.

363
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,160
Hey!

364
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,680
Drop the rope.

365
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,950
See you.

366
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,920
You-you’ll be dead when I get out.

367
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,070
Why-why does he do this?

368
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,800
I don’t know.

369
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,280
Your hand.

370
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,400
Raise your hand.

371
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,830
Make it accurate.

372
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,070
-Chief Guardian.
-Chief Guardian.

373
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,800
Have you seen Zhusha and Chequ?

374
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,970
Chief Guardian.

375
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,880
I haven’t seen them this afternoon.

376
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,640
OK.

377
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,470
Tell them to see me at once

378
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,640
when you see them.

379
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,470
OK.

380
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,970
You, come here. Keep practicing.

381
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,230
Faster. Come on.

382
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,650
Have you found any?

383
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,680
Yes.

384
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,070
All trash.

385
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,320
I have a bad feeling.

386
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,360
Have we been fooled by him again?

387
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,400
How dare he

388
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,430
fool us!

389
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,170
I’ll kill him when I get out.

390
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,230
Chequ.

391
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
I’m hungry.

392
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,400
Stop it.

393
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,190
I’m famished as well.

394
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,430
How come this place is so cold at night.

395
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,000
Are you cold?

396
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,950
Much better.

397
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,830
Oh, really?

398
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,920
Um...

399
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
-Zhusha.
-Chequ.

400
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,710
You speak first.

401
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,760
You speak first.

402
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,230
Actually, I’m always...

403
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,280
Actually, I’m always...

404
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,540
You like me, don’t you?

405
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,160
How...

406
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,470
How do you know?

407
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,110
I-I, in fact,

408
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,470
like you too.

409
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,760
Chequ.

410
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,110
If I hadn’t asked

411
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,520
for Feng She’s help,

412
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,300
you would never tell me

413
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,880
this, right?

414
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,040
I...

415
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,800
He-he asked you for money as well?

416
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,830
Yeah.

417
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,950
How much?

418
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I gave him all my pocket money.

419
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,880
I-I gave him all my money, too.

420
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,800
So...

421
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,000
So...

422
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,000
Then what?

423
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,800
I don’t have money

424
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,680
to buy drumsticks later.

425
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,920
Don’t worry.

426
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,670
I’ll give all my money

427
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,190
to you.

428
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,930
Been there for long enough?

429
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,440
Get up if that’s enough.

430
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,160
How come he ...

431
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,950
he come so early?

432
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,940
The flowers are so beautiful.

433
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,330
Do you like them?

434
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,110
If you do,

435
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,110
in the future,

436
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,350
I’ll pick a flower for you every day.

437
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,430
Every single day?

438
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,560
For how long?

439
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,490
One hundred years.

440
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,880
Liar.

441
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,810
I’ll be gone a hundred years later.

442
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,560
Then you’ll

443
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,280
have to marry someone that picks flowers

444
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,210
for you every day in your next life.

445
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,950
Tou brother

446
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:01,230
Have you ever thought

447
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,520
if you won’t be who you are in the next year,

448
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,720
what do you want to do?

449
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,000
If I get to choose,

450
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,760
I want

451
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,000
a jug of wine,

452
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,310
a pot of taros,

453
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,370
and a person that ages with me.

454
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,520
I want to watch birds chirp and flowers decay,

455
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,800
to rest whenever I like,

456
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,200
to be silly and careless,

457
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,040
to loiter about.

458
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,080
You want so much stuff.
Can’t you simplify your demands?

459
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,310
Well.

460
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,400
I want a zither, a jug of wine,

461
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,010
and a person that I love.

462
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,800
Still too much. Simpler.

463
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Simpler?

464
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,640
Then I’ll be an idler.

465
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
With a wife and children.

466
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,230
Simpler.

467
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,160
Simpler?

468
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,680
Be with you forever.

469
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,310
Xuezhi,

470
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
do you remember you promised me that

471
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,880
you’d give me

472
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,080
something that matters to you the most?

473
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,360
I think I’ve decided what I want.

474
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,920
What?

475
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,680
I want to be in your future.

476
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,190
I want to be with you

477
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,970
for the rest of my life.

478
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,640
I don’t have anything to give you,

479
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,040
but if you just nod,

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,070
I’ll be yours.

481
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,610
Chief Guardian.

482
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,170
Where have you been?

483
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,950
We...

484
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,070
The Blacksmithing Workshop was forging
a new batch of ironware.

485
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,110
What if something went wrong

486
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,590
when you weren’t around?

487
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,590
Sorry.

488
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,280
And you.

489
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,230
You’re in charge of the security

490
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,830
of the entire Hall of Flames.

491
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,060
Did you tell anyone

492
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,590
that you’d go AWOL?

493
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,400
I-I’m sorry, sir.

494
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,330
Chief Guardian.

495
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,040
Punish me if you must.

496
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,430
It can’t be that serious.

497
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,110
Shut up.

498
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,040
You’ve committed dereliction of duty.

499
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,160
You’ll be squatting on the practicing ground

500
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,430
for four hours.

501
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,400
Yes.

502
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,590
Yes.

503
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,310
Is someone watching you squatting?

504
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,760
No.

505
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,000
Then why are you squatting?

506
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,640
I... Have you forgotten?

507
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,920
We can’t disobey the Chief Guardian’s order.

508
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,110
Are you silly?

509
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,830
Here, drink some water.

510
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,560
Go. Go.

511
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,110
If you don’t drink the water,

512
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,920
I’ll drink it.

513
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,190
Here.

514
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,280
Slow down. It’s leaked.

515
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,800
What a dummy.

516
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,890
How many pieces of copper ware

517
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,060
and ironware do you

518
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,230
produce a day?

519
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,630
50 pieces of copper ware.

520
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,140
30 pieces of ironware.

521
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,590
Quite inefficient.

522
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,560
You need to increase the efficiency,

523
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,020
otherwise, it’s too slow.

524
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,070
What are you doing, Mr. Feng?

525
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,400
I’m working as your assistant supervisor.

526
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,280
The quality of the blades is good.

527
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,890
But the quantity isn’t enough.

528
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,760
So will you

529
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,710
keep supervising the Blacksmithing Workshop

530
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,000
or go out for fun?

531
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,880
Leader Chong saved my life.

532
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,160
I must, of course, repay her.

533
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,230
Go to Peace County.

534
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,090
Win more money.

535
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,470
Thanks.

536
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,000
Feng She.

537
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,950
Where are you going?

538
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,400
I’m going to Peace County to buy medicine.

539
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,230
Peace County?

540
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,830
You know what? Me too.

541
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,800
What are you going there for?

542
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,640
Buying stuff.

543
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,950
Master.

544
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,080
You wanted to see me?

545
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,800
Qingmei.

546
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,680
The Magistrate of Anzhou is
an old acquaintance of mine.

547
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,430
Tomorrow

548
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,630
is his 60th birthday.

549
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,560
I can’t be too showy

550
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,350
with my current status.

551
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,160
So

552
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,880
I’d like you to attend his birthday banquet
on my behalf.

553
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,680
Also, take the birthday gift

554
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,680
to him.

555
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,640
OK.

556
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,830
Oh, and...

557
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,880
This time,

558
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,850
I’ll ask Fengzi to go with you.

559
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:19,920
Master,

560
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,250
it’ll be a long journey.

561
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,470
Will it be too tiring

562
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,760
for her to go with me?

563
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,110
It’s fine.

564
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,190
She’s my daughter.

565
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,590
She represents the Sword Manor

566
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,070
more than you do.

567
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Plus, the girl

568
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,710
is spoiled since she was little.

569
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,710
She’s supposed to

570
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,430
experience some hardships.

571
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,330
Take care of her for me.

572
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,280
Rest assured, master.

573
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,010
I promise I’ll take care of her.

574
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,760
Feng She,

575
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,130
stop following me.

576
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,800
Don’t you have stuff to do?

577
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,350
Yeah.

578
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,760
But my thing can be postponed.

579
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,280
I’ll keep you company for now.

580
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,070
I’ll buy some medicine
at the pharmacy over there.

581
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,560
Why don’t you do your own stuff?

582
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,800
We’ll meet here later.

583
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,470
OK.

584
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,950
Trinkets and novelties. Come and have a look.

585
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,469
Qingmei.

586
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,000
Do you know

587
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,540
why my dad knows so many prestigious people?

588
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,560
He doesn’t know them.

589
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,630
They know him.

590
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,520
He was a duke.

591
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,190
Because he sniffed at fame and wealth,

592
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,870
he left the imperial court to be a martial recluse.

593
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,730
But he was one of the royal family.

594
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
Everybody holds respect

595
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,710
for you.

596
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,330
None of them isn’t envious of you.

597
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:35,280
Is that so?

598
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,909
Are you envious of me?

599
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,920
Hadn’t master kept me back then,

600
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,560
I don’t know where I’d be

601
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,280
or what kind of life I’d live right now.

602
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:49,389
Qingmei,

603
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,710
please don’t say this.

604
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,389
Look,

605
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,280
you’re the first disciple of Sword Manor.

606
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,190
And you ranked first at the Hero Assembly.

607
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,230
Everybody in the martial world says

608
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,670
you’re an up and coming young man.

609
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,950
What?

610
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,710
Is your leg hurt?

611
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,520
My foot hurts.

612
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,120
Your foot hurts.

613
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,720
Your heel is abraded.

614
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,890
I told you the size of the shoes wasn’t right.

615
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,560
Does it hurt a lot?

616
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,250
I’ll carry you back.

617
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,630
You carry me?

618
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,150
It-It’s inappropriate.

619
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,870
So...

620
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,360
Can you walk back home

621
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,520
on your own?

622
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,040
Are you going to drop?

623
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,840
I’ve heard the witch Chong Xuezhi
has achieved Lotus Wing.

624
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,710
Is it true?

625
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,320
Yes.

626
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,980
She’s grasped the fifth move.

627
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Then why don’t you steal the manual?

628
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,320
Two Lotus Wing manuals were burned,

629
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,280
but she’d already memorized

630
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,810
the content of the manuals.

631
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,910
Is my mom doing fine?

632
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,600
She’s doing fine.

633
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,930
You don’t need to worry.

634
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,470
Although Chong Xuezhi has grasped Lotus Wing,

635
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,710
she’s a good person.

636
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,280
She doesn’t intend to make an enemy
of the martial world.

637
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Now the Hall of Flames is well-behaved.

638
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,760
They won’t cause any harm anymore.

639
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,230
I’ve done my task of spying on
the Hall of Flames.

640
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,630
When can I go back to Emei?

641
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,150
I’ll tell your request to Abbess Ciren.

642
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,390
Before she gives you a reply,

643
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,840
you must keep your duty in mind.

644
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,950
Yes.

645
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,600
Tou,

646
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,390
I’ll teach you a new way

647
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,670
to play go.

648
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,950
Like this.

649
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,150
One, two, three, four, five.

650
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,760
Just...

651
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,870
Link five pieces.

652
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,670
You can link them horizontally or vertically

653
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,080
or crosswise.

654
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,230
You win if the five pieces are in a line.

655
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:19,910
Are you in?

656
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,110
Five-in-a-row game?

657
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,040
Pretty much.

658
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,210
I challenge you.

659
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,910
Come on.

660
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,410
You make the first move.

661
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,870
I win.

662
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,670
Well done, Xuezhi.

663
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,490
I’m a worse chess player than you.

664
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,390
But

665
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,630
I don’t know if I’m a better martial artist

666
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:09,040
than you are now that
my Lotus Sutra practicing is over.

667
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,600
Let’s have a test.

668
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,190
Let’s have a test.

669
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,950
Game on.

670
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,080
Game on.

671
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,280
What do you think of my power?

672
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,360
You said, once done, no regret.

673
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,470
I kind of regret imparting Lotus Sutra to you.

674
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,080
Did you regret coming to Moon Valley?

675
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,760
No.

676
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,280
I didn’t,

677
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,100
instead, I feel lucky.

678
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,670
Let’s go.

679
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,520
Come on, come on. Come here, people.

680
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,280
What are you doing?

681
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,800
Come on, come on. Come here, people.

682
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,710
Gather together.

683
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,970
Stop banging the gong.

684
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,080
Move.

685
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,950
Shoo. Shoo.

686
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,630
What do you want, Mr. Feng?

687
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,320
You’re all here.

688
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,280
Good.

689
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,630
I have an announcement to make.

690
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,800
What now?

691
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,280
Today,

692
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,460
I’ll leave the Hall of Flames.

693
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,280
Are you sure?

694
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,000
Yes.

695
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,520
I’ll embark on my adventure
in the martial world.

696
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,840
I know you don’t want me to go.

697
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,770
Don’t be too sad.

698
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,760
There might be a misunderstanding.

699
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,690
It’s good thing.

700
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,430
Why would we be sad?

701
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,670
Oh,

702
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,800
when the little beauty comes back,

703
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
send my regard to her.

704
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Guys,

705
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,840
here I bid you farewell.

706
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,520
Wait.

707
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,760
Chequ,

708
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,910
go get Mr. Feng some money.

709
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,430
Yes.

710
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,950
I’ll take the money then.

711
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,680
Thanks a lot.

712
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,560
Feng She.

713
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,560
Feng She, wait.

714
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,470
Feng She.

715
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,670
Feng She.

716
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,150
Thank you for keeping the secret for me.

717
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,230
It’s nothing.

718
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Everybody

719
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,850
has secrets.

720
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,950
Plus,

721
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,190
you generally treat

722
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,390
the little beauty nicely.

723
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,390
Here’s my advice,

724
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,770
the sooner you come clean the better.

725
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,800
Why are you leaving?

726
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,710
The leader said,

727
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,470
it’s your home.

728
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,150
It’s your home.

729
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,360
During the days I lived here,

730
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,390
I did feel that

731
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,670
you are a big family.

732
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,120
But I’m not.

733
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,710
I do not

734
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,430
fit into this place.

735
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,630
Where will you go?

736
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,640
Everywhere.

737
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,430
And I’ll find my home.

738
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,220
Over the years,

739
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,070
I’ve always wanted to go back to my own home.

740
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,470
Good luck, then.

741
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,390
You too.

742
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,320
Feng She.

743
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Be careful.
