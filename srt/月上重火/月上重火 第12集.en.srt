2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 12

4
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,630
Miss Chong, you should go to bed early.

5
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,110
We have a big fish to fry tomorrow.

6
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,080
Shangguan,

7
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,079
where will you go

8
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,190
after tomorrow?

9
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,190
To where I should go.

10
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
You never answer my question properly

11
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,520
every time I ask you about your whereabouts.

12
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,750
Am I really

13
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,110
that annoying to you?

14
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,270
That’s not true.

15
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,390
I might have annoyed you before.

16
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,320
But I won’t do that

17
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,360
anymore.

18
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,080
Then

19
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,800
Mr. Lin can rest assured now.

20
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,270
Isn’t this

21
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,550
The bell-toller at Luduan Temple?

22
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,720
He doesn’t look like

23
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,190
a martial man.

24
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,160
Can he be a scapegoat?

25
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,470
What’s this about?

26
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,630
Tell us, hurry up.

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,880
you are right

28
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,240
I stole the Nine Moves.

29
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,960
Years ago,

30
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,960
I joined the Hall of Flames

31
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,550
and became a disciple there

32
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,550
because I wanted to approach the Nine Moves.

33
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,880
5 years ago,

34
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,790
the Hall signed a contract with other schools.

35
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,110
So I made a plan.

36
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,880
I left the Hall secretly

37
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,920
and became a monk here,

38
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,159
waiting for the day of

39
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,790
the manual’s arrival.

40
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,260
[Nine Moves of Lotus God]

41
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
What a bell-toller!

42
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,510
You’ve waited for 5 years to switch the manual.

43
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,760
You’ve disgraced the Sword Manor

44
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
in front of all schools.

45
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,000
But something

46
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,670
still worried me.

47
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,640
Wang Yinya

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
witnessed

49
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,880
what I had done that night.

50
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,440
I knew I was exposed.

51
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,510
So I went to Xiangzhou

52
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,110
to silence him for good.

53
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,320
In the meantime,

54
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,920
the Hall of Flames was looking for me.

55
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,350
So I took away Wang Yinya’s

56
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,950
badge and silver whip,

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,640
and scapegoated the Hall of Flames.

58
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,320
I made everyone believe that

59
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,350
Chong Xuezhi was the murderer.

60
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,320
Then I’d be safe.

61
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,070
But still

62
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,040
I didn’t feel reassured.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,070
Because I would never be free

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,390
if the Nine Moves

65
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,510
still existed.

66
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,550
So

67
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,760
I designed a trap

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
and Chong Xuezhi would be the one

69
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,880
to trigger it and burn the manual.

70
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,350
In this way,

71
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,550
people would think she wanted

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,550
to destroy the evidence.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,270
Then no one will

74
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,760
notice me anymore.

75
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,920
And there won’t be

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,550
anyone else to learn this art.

77
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,640
So

78
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
I will be the only master

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,760
of the Nine Moves!

80
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,070
Leaders of schools,

81
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,270
now you know the Hall of Flames

82
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,790
has been wronged, right?

83
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Then how should we

84
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,510
deal with this person?

85
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,920
How about leaving him to the Sword Manor

86
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,040
just like last time.

87
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,320
He used to be our disciple,

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,160
and then became a monk

89
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,600
in Luduan Temple.

90
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,200
So

91
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,830
his disposal

92
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,070
will be the business of the Hall of Flames

93
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,510
and the Luduan Temple.

94
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
I don’t think so.

95
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,600
Why not?

96
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,830
You want to take him back

97
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,600
so that he can write down the Nine Moves

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,480
and make it alive again, don’t you?

99
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,110
Huashan Sect will be the first

100
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,440
to oppose your proposal.

101
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,550
We won’t trouble you with this.

102
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,159
Xuezhi?

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,200
Miss Chong?

104
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,159
Aren’t you…

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,390
What?

106
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,230
What’s going on?

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,390
I’m not dead.

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
Sorry for disappointing you.

109
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,510
What’s your hidden agenda for

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,760
lying to us all this time?

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,920
I have come to end the possibility

112
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,550
of Lotus Wing coming into being.

113
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,040
We all know when the two manuals are combined

114
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,760
to be the Lotus Wing, it’ll be invincible.

115
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,510
If you all believe that

116
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,880
we will repeat our previous mistake,

117
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,350
then there will be only one choice left.

118
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,480
Stop.

119
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,880
You evil little girl.

120
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,200
Now that the Lotus Wing is burned,

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,590
you have no reason to

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,710
worry about the Hall of Flames anymore, right?

123
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,789
Merciful Buddha.

124
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,200
Young Master.

125
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:43,909
I knew nothing

126
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,670
about what Hong Sheng’s done.

127
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,400
However,

128
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,030
he’s our disciple anyway.

129
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,960
I apologize to you

130
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
on his behalf.

131
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,350
Don’t be, Abbot Shiyan.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,590
Without you

133
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,200
I’ll never be able to clear my name.

134
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,840
It’s also a good thing for us

135
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,790
that your name

136
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,150
can be cleared

137
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,960
here at the Luduan Temple.

138
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,030
All I ask today is to

139
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,550
let all of you know the truth.

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,590
I’m not coming to dispose him.

141
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,350
Merciful Buddha.

142
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,910
You’ve burned the Lotus Wing.

143
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
But what’s behind

144
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,960
your fake death?

145
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,440
Tell us the truth.

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Otherwise you won’t leave here today.

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
We never try to

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,280
talk sense into the insane.

149
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,030
Muyuan,

150
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,550
let’s go.

151
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,960
Father.

152
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,760
-Xuezhi.
-Father.

153
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Leader.

154
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,150
Are you OK?

155
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,590
Father.

156
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Shangguan Tou,

157
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,000
this is none of your business.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,030
Don’t put your finger into the pie.

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,350
I will keep my finger in

160
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,550
till the end.

161
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,150
Then you are going against the martial morality.

162
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,280
Martial morality?

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,520
Leader Feng, would you please tell me

164
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,790
what “martial morality” means to you?

165
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,670
Does it mean all schools

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
persecuting a young girl together?

167
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,670
Qingmei,

168
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,080
go help him out.

169
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,280
They’re working together to bully him.

170
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,200
Everyone,

171
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,000
it was me who proposed this meeting

172
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,470
three months ago.

173
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,760
If you keep fighting,

174
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,200
there will inevitably be injuries.

175
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,080
So now I propose that

176
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,550
we change a way of negotiation.

177
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,280
What way?

178
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,030
I had a fight with Shangguan Tou previously

179
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,790
when he was not yet on the side of the Hall of Flames.

180
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,790
I say I should have another fight with him.

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,350
If I win,

182
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,520
Shangguan Tou should never intervene in this.

183
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,350
And if I lose,

184
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
then we all should stop

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,470
and drop the case.

186
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,150
You enjoy being a peace-maker, don’t you?

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,470
You won’t figure things out

188
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,400
in the old way.

189
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,790
Then why don’t we solve this

190
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,030
with a simple fight.

191
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,320
Good.

192
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,790
I agree.

193
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,150
Young Master.

194
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,910
-Xuezhi.
-Xuezhi.
-Xuezhi.

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,230
Go back to the inn.

196
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,840
She can’t leave.

197
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,000
Kill her!

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,470
Shangguan,

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,350
Please

200
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,230
take care of Xuezhi.

201
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,030
Don’t worry.

202
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,030
If you want revenge,

203
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,470
come to me.

204
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,320
Muyuan,

205
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,280
you’ll answer all our questions

206
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,790
on behalf of the Hall of the Flames.

207
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,710
Mr. Feng,

208
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,030
they’ve already proved

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
their innocence.

210
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,670
don’t push people into the wall.

211
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,710
Let’s

212
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,790
call an end to this.

213
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,960
Shiyan,

214
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,470
this is between the Hall of Flames and us.

215
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,670
It’s not your business.

216
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,590
You are in the Luduan Temple.

217
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,880
If you fight here

218
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,030
then you’ll be declaring a war to us.

219
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,790
You can hurt

220
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,960
nobody

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,670
from the Hall of Flames today.

222
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,640
Mr. Feng,

223
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,710
You’re injured.

224
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,280
You should receive treatment soon.

225
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,520
Otherwise it might linger forever.

226
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,640
Mr. Feng,

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,350
I think you should leave.

228
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,760
If you want things to end in your way,

229
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,520
go to the Hall of Flames on another day.

230
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,200
We outnumber them today.

231
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,280
People will despise us no matter what we do.

232
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,000
Father,

233
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,910
let’s go.

234
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,960
Merciful Buddha.

235
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,880
Go.

236
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
This isn’t over yet.

237
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,710
Merciful Buddha.

238
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,030
Thank you, Abbot.

239
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,080
Abbot,

240
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,960
I have a favor to ask.

241
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,550
My Young Master is injured now.

242
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,590
So could you please keep Hong Sheng

243
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,350
in custody here in Luduan Temple to

244
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,790
wait for your disposal?

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,350
I agree.

246
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,150
Merciful Buddha.

247
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,790
Miss Chong.

248
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,880
Miss Chong.

249
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,080
Miss Chong.

250
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Sorry for dragging you down.

251
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,910
Please, send me back.

252
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,080
You silly girl.

253
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,150
I’d predicted I’d be in such situation

254
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,670
when I promised Mr. Lin to protect you.

255
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,230
Then why did you promise him?

256
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,840
A promise is a promise.

257
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,790
I don’t regret.

258
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,320
And you should not be capricious anymore.

259
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,400
Let me treat your wound.

260
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,710
Shangguan,

261
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,350
I know you protect me

262
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,280
because of Uncle Lin.

263
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,440
But

264
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,350
you’ve done enough to deliver your promise.

265
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,350
You can stop

266
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,400
from now on.

267
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,320
What about you?

268
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,320
How will you face what will happen?

269
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,230
You’re still naive.

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,710
What you’ve been through is but a tip of the iceberg.

271
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,590
How can you protect yourself?

272
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,110
That’s not your burden to bear.

273
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,960
Can you accept it

274
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,200
if you lose?

275
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,400
I won’t lose.

276
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
I have Muyuan,

277
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,320
Chequ,

278
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,840
Liuli and Zhusha.

279
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,640
I have the entire Hall of Flames.

280
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,840
Shangguan,

281
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,840
thank you for everything you’ve done for me.

282
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,150
But that’s my fate.

283
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,550
I want to face it on my own.

284
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,640
And I want you

285
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,150
to find your own path

286
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,790
as soon as possible.

287
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Have you

288
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,550
decided it yet?

289
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Then what am I to you?

290
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,560
I have my guardian.

291
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,920
And you

292
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,950
are not that person.

293
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,710
Miss Chong,

294
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,430
you are as clear

295
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
as a crystal.

296
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,230
I want you to keep it this way.

297
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,110
Don’t you ever become worldly.

298
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,070
You told me you needed to protect someone

299
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,800
when we were in the cave.

300
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,560
Who would that be?

301
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,800
You’ll know one day.

302
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,000
The person I need to protect

303
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,430
is you.

304
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,950
Gugu.

305
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,310
Chief Guardin, you’re back.

306
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,230
How’s it going?

307
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,640
Who won in the convention?

308
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,590
Miss, Mister.

309
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,430
Tell me, who won?

310
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,590
Why do you care about this, kid?

311
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,350
Where’s Miss Xuezhi?

312
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,310
I haven’t seen her.

313
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,400
Have you seen Shangguan?

314
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,350
Neither.

315
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,920
Isn’t he with you?

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,680
Chief Guardian

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,350
where will Shangguan go

318
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,830
with Young Master?

319
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,110
Don’t worry, I’ll go look for them now.

320
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,640
How’s Xuezhi now?

321
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
I’ve treated her wound.

322
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,950
Nothing serious left.

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,110
If so,

324
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,950
let me take care of her.

325
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,590
Chief Guardian,

326
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,640
she was severely injured before.

327
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,880
She might be not be in the fatal state now

328
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,640
but she might still

329
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,640
have short breath

330
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,110
for some time.

331
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,310
Please

332
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,230
care for her tenderly.

333
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,760
I am the Chief Guardian.

334
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,470
It is my responsibility

335
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,710
to look after my Young Master.

336
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,310
Don’t you worry, Shangguan.

337
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,190
Goodbye.

338
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:16,950
Chief Guardian.

339
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,640
Anything else I can do for you?

340
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,920
Miss Chong

341
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,000
is under your protection now.

342
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,760
Goodbye.

343
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,110
Miss Chong,

344
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,310
is he your guardian?

345
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,560
It’s becoming late now.

346
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,310
Young Master is recovering.

347
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,190
You can all go back and sleep.

348
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,280
Gugu, Zhu Sha.

349
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,470
Wait. I’m not done yet.

350
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,000
Let’s go.

351
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,230
Just a minute.

352
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,430
Shush.

353
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
Tou.

354
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,160
Tou.

355
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,710
How are you doing

356
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,000
all these years?

357
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,430
You don’t just come by

358
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,400
to say hello to me, do you?

359
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,310
Are you still angry with me?

360
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,920
I know

361
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,590
I’ve done something wrong years ago.

362
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,230
But I…

363
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,760
I didn’t mean to…

364
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,230
I don’t want to mention the past anymore.

365
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
And you don’t need to make further explanations.

366
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,830
OK. OK.

367
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,160
Then let’s forget about it.

368
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,880
Will you forgive me?

369
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Will you?

370
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,680
Tou?

371
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,640
Go back to the Sword Manor with me

372
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,950
just like old times, OK?

373
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,560
You are kidding me, Miss Lin.

374
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,000
I am no longer

375
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,710
the teenager back then.

376
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,430
I’ve left there

377
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
and I will never come back.

378
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,110
But my heart

379
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,760
is as it was.

380
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,520
So is mine.

381
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,190
I will never

382
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,350
have feelings for you.

383
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,190
You should go.

384
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,430
I don't believe it

385
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,710
I won’t give up anyway.

386
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,000
Look at that.

387
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,280
Master, you are as excellent

388
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,160
in hurting girls

389
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,830
as in pleasing them.

390
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,800
You’re also quite good at eavesdropping.

391
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,880
You must be teasing me, Master.

392
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,920
Wait.

393
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,000
Master,

394
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
Your inner energy…

395
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,640
Why is it…

396
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
I don’t need it anymore.

397
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,190
You’ve passed it to Miss Chong?

398
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,070
Why?

399
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,880
I got it from Mr. Lin at the first place.

400
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,920
Now I’ve passed it to Miss Chong,

401
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,640
so I’ve finished my mission from Mr. Lin

402
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,710
of protecting Miss Chong.

403
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,950
Besides,

404
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,920
I have you by my side.

405
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,070
I don’t really need the inner energy.

406
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,160
Keeping it with me will be a waste.

407
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,230
You are being too generous, Master.

408
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,350
No energy is left with you now.

409
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,680
Enough.

410
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,070
Go pack up.

411
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,950
We’re leaving for Emei.

412
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,590
Muyuan.

413
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,680
What?

414
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,230
Look,

415
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,350
this is my drawing.

416
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,070
What’s this.

417
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,880
It’s the whole family.

418
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,520
The whole family?

419
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,760
See?

420
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
This is Chequ.

421
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,760
This is you.

422
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,470
This is Zhu Sha.

423
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,640
This is Liuli.

424
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,950
This is Xuezhi.

425
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,880
This is me.

426
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
And this is Shangguan.

427
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,470
Gugu,

428
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,800
why is Shangguan Tou

429
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,830
in the family picture?

430
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,400
He’s even by Xuezhi’s side.

431
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,640
Because when you’re not around,

432
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,800
Shangguan, Xuezhi and me

433
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,680
have been together all along.

434
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,230
Together all along?

435
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,310
Dad,

436
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,070
Dad.

437
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,760
Why don’t you see me?

438
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,190
Are you avoiding me?

439
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,430
Have I done something wrong?

440
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,350
I promise I’ll behave.

441
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,350
I’m not.

442
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,400
Why would I avoid you?

443
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,160
I won’t.

444
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,310
You are the best.

445
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,760
I want to be with you forever,

446
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,520
watching you grow into a big girl.

447
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,350
Then stay with me more.

448
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,760
Xuezhi.

449
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,640
Remember what I’ve told you here.

450
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
Take good care of yourself.

451
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,190
I’m afraid I…

452
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,310
Dad?

453
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,040
Xuezhi.

454
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,680
Xuezhi.

455
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,350
You’re awake.

456
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,800
Miss Xuezhi, you’re finally awake.

457
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,590
Muyuan,

458
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,350
why am I here?

459
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,160
Well…

460
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,000
Shangguan brought you here.

461
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,830
And

462
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,110
where is he?

463
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,590
Gone.

464
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,710
Cheng.

465
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,590
Even if they didn’t kill the man,

466
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,470
they are still to be blame

467
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,110
for failing to guard the Nine Moves.

468
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,350
They feel mighty because

469
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,280
they have connections with the government.

470
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
They forge weapon for it.

471
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,830
And all schools

472
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,950
need weapons

473
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,400
made by them

474
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,520
from time to time.

475
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,880
Now that the Nine Moves and the Lotus Sutra are burned,

476
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,710
we stand lesser chance to root them out, right?

477
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,560
Never mind.

478
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,640
We’ve still got chance

479
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,680
as long as Hong Sheng is alive.

480
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:55,880
Hong Sheng?

481
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,710
The bell-toller?

482
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,590
Yes.

483
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,520
Let’s catch him

484
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,110
and make him write down the Nine Moves.

485
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,160
We’ve found the thief

486
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,310
on the Weapon Ranking Convention.

487
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,160
Let’s call it a worthy trip.

488
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
But think about

489
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,310
what we’ve cost.

490
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,950
We’ve lost the Nine Moves and the Lotus Sutra.

491
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,190
My dad made the terrible mistake

492
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,400
all because of the Nine Moves.

493
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,230
And people will do anything despite morality

494
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,560
to get the two manuals combined.

495
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,920
Maybe it’s better

496
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,560
to burn them.

497
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,760
My father’s debt

498
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,040
is paid off now.

499
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,590
I’d love to agree with you,

500
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,350
but before we left home,

501
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
the Elder in Chief

502
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,760
told us to keep the manual well.

503
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
And now…

504
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,400
I can’t imagine

505
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,350
how the Elder in Chief will punish us.

506
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,830
It was me who burned the manual.

507
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,830
If he wants to condemn someone,

508
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,710
I’ll take the full responsibility.

509
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,800
Young Master, that’s not what I mean.

510
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,760
Actually,

511
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,710
that’s not what worries me now.

512
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,430
Let me guess.

513
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,520
Though we have

514
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,950
found out the truth

515
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,070
and proved our innocence,

516
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,230
the traitors inside the Hall of Flames

517
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,430
have not yet been identified.

518
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
And if we don’t find them out,

519
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
we’ll still be in danger,

520
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
right?

521
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,680
Exactly.

522
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
Don’t worry, Young Master.

523
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,830
I’ll put my hand to it

524
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,230
and find the traitors out

525
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,640
when I return home.

526
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,950
What’s this for, Abbot?

527
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,920
I come here to discuss his disposal.

528
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,710
Hong Sheng used to be one of your disciples.

529
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,800
He developed the urge to kill

530
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,040
all because he had learned the art from your sect.

531
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,520
Given his deep connection

532
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
with the Hall of Flames,

533
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
I think

534
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
it’ll be the best choice to leave him

535
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,070
at your disposal.

536
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,760
You’ve made thing simpler.

537
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,470
Young Master,

538
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,590
I’ll kill him right away.

539
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,310
Zhu Sha.

540
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,920
Think about it.

541
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,070
Thanks to him, we’re now seen

542
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,760
as a cult that kills.

543
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,640
Young Master,

544
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,760
he’ll cause endless troubles in the future if not killed.

545
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,880
Abbot Shiyan, you say you will

546
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,520
leave him to us.

547
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,830
Does that mean the Luduan Temple

548
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,880
will never intervene

549
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,000
however we decide to deal with him?

550
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,640
Of course.

551
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,000
Good.

552
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,000
Then we’ll take him back to the Hall

553
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,680
and put him in prison forever.

554
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,230
What?

555
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,350
You won’t kill me?

556
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,680
I don’t want to see

557
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,920
even one more person die from the Nine Moves.

558
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,070
Besides, death will be too easy for you.

559
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,800
It’ll be more of a torture to leave you

560
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,830
alive in repentance.

561
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,880
Merciful Buddha.

562
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,190
You have a kind heart.

563
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,560
The Hall of Flames is lucky to have you.

564
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,880
So is the whole martial world.

565
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,430
Merciful Buddha.

566
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,920
Serve the two jars of spirit to that table.

567
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,710
OK.

568
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,190
Go.

569
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,310
Mister.

570
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,590
Mr. Xia.

571
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,160
Do you want to

572
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,520
check in?

573
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,040
I’m here for the Young Master and the Chief Guardian

574
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,920
of the Hall of Flames.

575
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,470
What a pity.

576
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,710
They’ve left

577
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,710
earlier this morning.

578
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,830
They’ve left?

579
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,760
Yes.

580
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,310
Go. Catch up.

581
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,350
Catch up.

582
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,560
Shoot.

583
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,350
Watch out!

584
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,110
Protect Young Master.

585
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,160
Gugu!

586
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,710
Gugu!

587
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
Are you OK?

588
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,800
Gugu.

589
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,400
Can you take me home?

590
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,710
I’ll take you home.

591
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,000
Gugu.

592
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,640
Gugu!

593
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,560
Gugu!

594
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,640
Young Master.

595
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,400
Zhu Sha!

596
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,160
Zhu Sha!

597
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,830
Retreat!

598
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,800
Zhu Sha!

599
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:09,840
Zhu Sha!

600
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,560
Zhu Sha. Zhu Sha. Are you OK?

601
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,670
Yu Wan?

602
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,630
Why don’t you get me?

603
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,150
You should be the Leader of the Hall.

604
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,600
Chong Xuezhi

605
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,520
is nothing but an ignorant little girl.

606
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,840
She won’t be able to lead the Hall.

607
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,320
Nor is she aware of how treacherous the world is.

608
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,949
Get out.

609
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,520
The arrows are poisoned.

610
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,630
Luckily Chequ blocked her inner channel in time.

611
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,630
She’s not in danger now.

612
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,870
That man was determined to kill Young Master.

613
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,520
Poisoned arrows? Unbelievable.

614
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,190
Is there any way to save her?

615
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,630
I’ve got toxicide with me.

616
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,470
But that will only help her for now.

617
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,760
We need to get home sooner

618
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,150
to save her.

619
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,360
Chequ, take Gugu too.

620
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,390
OK.

621
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,870
Have you caught any man?

622
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,840
No.

623
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,040
How’s Zhu Sha doing now?

624
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,430
She’s doing OK for now.

625
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,430
Are you worrying about Miss Chong?

626
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,120
Someone else is caring for her now.

627
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,120
So I don’t need to worry anymore.

628
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,520
It’s just…

629
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,760
I don’t know what lies ahead.

630
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,230
I have no idea

631
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,040
what lies ahead.

632
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,800
But I know clearly

633
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,520
that my mission

634
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,670
is to keep you safe

635
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,760
no matter what happens.

636
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,760
Good.

637
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,910
Hong Sheng.

638
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,710
Hong Sheng.

639
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,190
Help me.

640
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,710
Help me.

641
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,870
What?

642
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,190
Chong Xuezhi’s still alive?

643
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,320
Yes, Sir.

644
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,190
She suddenly showed up on the convention.

645
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,430
And then she even burned

646
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,630
the Lotus Sutra.

647
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,430
How dare she!

648
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,560
I planned a sneak attack to get rid of her

649
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,000
on their way back here.

650
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,320
But then Leader Muyuan stopped us.

651
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,390
What’s worse,

652
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,190
he knows I’m involved

653
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,630
Where are they now?

654
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,430
They

655
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,710
should still be on the way back here.

656
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,080
Go find somewhere to hide yourself up.

657
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,910
Don’t come back unless I ask you to.

658
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:05,870
But,

659
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,000
what about Leader Muyuan?

660
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,470
I’ll handle this.

661
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,360
Leave.

662
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,670
Yes, Sir.

663
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Elder Yuchi.

664
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,000
Young Master.

665
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,560
You…you’re still alive!

666
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,190
What a pleasure to see you back safe and sound.

667
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,190
What a pleasure!

668
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,000
Disciples,

669
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,390
months ago,

670
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,320
I assumed the position of the Leader because

671
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,120
Young Master’s whereabouts were then unknown.

672
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,630
But now,

673
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,000
Young Master has come back,

674
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,710
so I should hand over the responsibility

675
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,430
as the Leader back to her.

676
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,190
Therefore,

677
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,470
-from now on…
-She can’t.

678
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,190
Elder in Chief.

679
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,600
She’s back now.

680
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,000
Why can’t she?

681
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,080
The Hall of Flames has gone through

682
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,080
over a hundred years of weal and woe

683
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,390
to reach the current status in the martial world.

684
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,360
As we all know,

685
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,470
our leader

686
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,080
should be someone with both talents and virtues,

687
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,360
excelling both in literature and martial arts.

688
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,430
It can’t be an incompetent and ignorant little girl.

689
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,470
Elder in Chief.

690
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,080
Leader.

691
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,840
I know you grew up together with her,

692
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,870
and treat her as your sister.

693
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,520
But our Leader

694
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,040
will decide our rise and fall in the future.

695
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,630
You can’t be blind by your emotion

696
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,190
from childhood.

697
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Elder Yuwen has got the point.

698
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,000
I am too incompetent and ignorant

699
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,840
to be the leader indeed.

700
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,520
Young Master,

701
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,360
not now.

702
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,430
The current leader Yuwen Muyuan

703
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,910
is both talented and virtuous,

704
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,560
well-received by all disciples.

705
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,600
It is our fortune to have him.

706
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,150
What do you say?

707
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,520
We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.

708
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,600
We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.

709
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,910
We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.

710
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,560
You…

711
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,470
- We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.
-You…

712
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,120
We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.

713
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,910
We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.

714
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,080
- We’d like Leader Muyuan to stay in his position.
-Shut up.

715
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,470
I’ll say it one more time.

716
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,520
There’s only one leader

717
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,910
here in the Hall of Flames.

718
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,280
And that will be Chong Xuezhi.

719
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,280
She almost died from

720
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,710
fighting to resume the reputation

721
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,710
of the Hall of Flames

722
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,630
so that

723
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,230
you could walk tall

724
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,870
in front of other schools.

725
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,910
Also,

726
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,560
Hall of Flames

727
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,150
was founded by Mr. Chong.

728
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,760
Your food,

729
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,190
your clothes, your daily supplies

730
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,800
are all provided by the Chong family.

731
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,870
Listen to yourself.

732
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,430
How dare you question her?

733
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,120
From now on.

734
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,670
whoever

735
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,910
ask me to be the Leader

736
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,870
will be expelled from here.

737
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,870
Yuwen Muyuan,

738
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,910
you’ll ruin

739
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,800
the Hall of Flames one day.

740
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
Don’t worry.

741
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,950
I’m here with you.

742
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
You asked Yu Wan to do so,

743
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,150
didn’t you?

744
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,630
I don’t know

745
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,520
what you’re talking about.

746
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,710
Stop lying.

747
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,840
Yu Wan has been following us furtively

748
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,000
ever since we left the Hall.

749
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,520
He even tried to kill Young Master from time to time.

750
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,520
He won’t dare to do so

751
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,230
without your permission.

752
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,280
Grandpa,

753
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,080
I know

754
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,150
you want me to be the Leader.

755
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,430
But you don’t need to

756
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,630
put Young Master to death.

757
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,870
You’ve known her ever since she was a baby.

758
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,800
How can you be that cruel?

759
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,120
I’m cruel?

760
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,080
Say this word not to me,

761
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,000
but to Chong Xuezhi’s father,

762
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,840
Chong Ye.

763
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,080
You know who the girl

764
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,000
you’ve been protecting is?

765
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,470
Of course I do.

766
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,910
She’s the Young Master

767
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,230
and the future Leader of the Hall of Flames.

768
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,430
Young Master?

769
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,950
What are you laughing at?

770
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,000
At your stupidity.

771
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,710
And your ignorance.

772
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,470
You’ve been protecting the daughter

773
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,120
of your father’s murderer.

774
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,040
What?

775
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,670
You know why

776
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,800
Chong Ye asked me to be the Elder

777
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,670
and you to take the respected

778
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,430
and powerful position of Chief Guardian?

779
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,760
It’s because he was guilty.

780
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,560
Of what?

781
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,710
Of having killed your father.

782
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,670
I don’t believe this.

783
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,000
Your father and Chong Ye

784
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,120
used to be sworn friends.

785
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,430
Years ago,

786
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,800
Chong Ye went mad after

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,560
learning the Nine Moves.

788
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,600
You think he adopted you

789
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,080
out of kindness?

790
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,950
No.

791
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,670
It’s because he owed our family a life!

792
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,950
Now you work for the devil’s cause and

793
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,430
protect the daughter of your father’s murderer?

794
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,390
That’s how you respect your late father?
