[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 17

4
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,110
Fengzi.

5
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
What brings you here?

6
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,690
Come. Let me see if you’re better.

7
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,560
Much better.

8
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,190
Father told me

9
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,800
you got the medicine

10
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,260
from Shark Sect to save me.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,370
It must be very hard.

12
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,420
As long as you can be cured,

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,000
that was nothing.

14
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,079
Are you so worried about me?

15
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,829
I’m worried about you

16
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,079
every moment.

17
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,270
Thank you.

18
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
Don’t be so polite to me.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,930
I’m your senior.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,329
That’s what I should do.

21
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,910
Over these years,

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
you’ve been taking care of me

23
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,960
all the time,

24
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,030
heart and soul.

25
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,079
Yet I took it

26
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,360
for granted.

27
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,520
Sorry, Senior.

28
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,910
I’m too ignorant.

29
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,440
Your apology

30
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,830
means what I did

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,550
isn’t in vain.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,800
Alright.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,530
You just recovered. It’s cold.

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,750
Go back to rest.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,830
Go.

36
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,360
Feng She.

37
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,910
Go to scout ahead.

38
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,720
Miss Chong.

39
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,280
I can’t go to the Hall of Flames with you.

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Why?

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,660
I decide to go back to Dongdu first

42
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,270
and tell my father about the epidemic,

43
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,270
so we could gather the power of the court

44
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,530
to combat the disease.

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,910
But

46
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,470
it’s a long way ahead.

47
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,910
You have injuries.

48
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,320
No worries.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,650
I’ll let the imperial physicians heal me.

50
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,080
But you,

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,250
take good care of yourself.

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,390
Well,

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,350
if I want to find you,

54
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,320
where should I go?

55
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,200
When it’s done,

56
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,930
I’m going back to the Moon Valley.

57
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
Xuezhi.

58
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,270
Don’t be like me.

59
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,320
If you love someone,

60
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,270
be sure to

61
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,480
be with him determinedly.

62
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,550
Do not be like me,

63
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,390
regretting it all your life.

64
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,760
Farewell.

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,790
Qingmei.

66
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,290
What’s on your mind?

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,070
Tell me.

68
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe I can help you out.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,920
Lately

70
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,490
I’ve practiced the fifth move

71
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,700
of the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

72
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
Are you sure it’s the fifth move?

73
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,110
Mastering the fifth move of the Nine Moves

74
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,110
requires great talent

75
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,350
and tons of time.

76
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,390
You... You just took one year

77
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,200
to master it.

78
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,200
It... It means you’re extremely talented.

79
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,720
I didn’t see you wrong.

80
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,110
You are gifted.

81
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,670
It’s all because

82
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,950
you taught me well.

83
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,100
My teaching

84
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,480
account for three out of ten.

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,320
The rest

86
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,440
relies on your talent and comprehension.

87
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,200
Tell me.

88
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,720
How are you feeling now?

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,180
The Nine Moves of Lotus God

90
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,680
easily gets people mutilated.

91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,060
I regretted it.

92
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,920
That’s not what I’m asking.

93
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,640
I mean

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
your inner heart.

95
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,720
Do you feel

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
that you can’t

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
control yourself?

98
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,790
Do you

99
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,350
have like evil intentions

100
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
like killing?

101
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,920
No, I don’t.

102
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
Rest assured, sir.

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,420
I’m not losing my mind.

104
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,830
Good.

105
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,950
The higher level you reach,

106
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,550
the stronger the heart demon is.

107
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,950
You must be very careful.

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,080
If any sign of demonization,

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
stop practicing instantly.

110
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,640
Sure. Got it.

111
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
Master,

112
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,290
please continue teaching me the Nine Moves.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
Don’t be too anxious.

114
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,110
You practice so fast

115
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,760
without Lotus Sutra.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,880
If you keep practicing like this blindly,

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,810
you’ll definitely get demonized.

118
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,070
If so,

119
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,190
without the Lotus Sutra,

120
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,010
I’ll remain at the fifth move, right?

121
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,440
The Lotus Wing

122
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,770
are created complementary to each other.

123
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,050
That’s all we can do.

124
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,790
Although it’s only the fifth move,

125
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,830
you already have few rivals in the world.

126
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,040
Looks like I can’t be a supreme master.

127
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,150
I think of another possibility.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
It's just that...

129
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,880
What is it?

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,830
Forget it.

131
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,790
It's too risky.

132
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,950
Sir.

133
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,720
As long as there is a way to improve,

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,350
I’m willing to take any risk.

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,909
If it’s on me,

136
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,230
I have no concerns.

137
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,850
But you’re a prodigy of martial arts.

138
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,120
I don't want you to take any risk.

139
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,760
Sir.

140
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,790
Listen to me.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,670
In this world,

142
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,550
I’m the only one who can play the Nine Moves.

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,640
Who else

144
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,840
can you use it on?

145
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,200
Right?

146
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,480
The Sutra Library in Luduan Temple

147
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,990
has many secret books on heart methods.

148
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,150
They are not

149
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,590
as good as the Lotus Sutra,

150
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,340
but the effect is similar.

151
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,790
If we replace the Lotus Sutra

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,200
with these secret books,

153
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,950
perhaps you can try to learn the ninth move.

154
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,150
That’s a good idea.

155
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,150
But

156
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,100
Sutra Library is critical to Luduan Temple.

157
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,150
They won’t lend me the books.

158
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
Of course, you won’t borrow them.

159
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,350
I’ve been there for so many years.

160
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,150
I know it like the back of my hand.

161
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,400
How to avoid the patrolling guards,

162
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,200
how to enter the Library, and where the sutras are.

163
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
I know all these well.

164
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,230
Understand?

165
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,710
Well.

166
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm willing to have a try.

167
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,350
Eat.

168
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,080
Leader.

169
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,520
You’re back.

170
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,760
How did it go?

171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,080
Isn’t he

172
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
the disciple of Man Feiyue?

173
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,790
He’s also a thief.

174
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,840
-I...
-His name is Feng She.

175
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
He knows the prescription to cure the epidemic.

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,670
I bring him back to prepare the antidote.

177
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,440
Leader.

178
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
He killed Huashan Sect’s disciples

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,670
on the Hero Assembly.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,460
Are you sure he can help us?

181
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,150
We have no choice.

182
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,550
Man Feiyue is dead.

183
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,510
Only he knows the prescription.

184
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,380
Don’t you trust me?

185
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,960
I’m leaving then.

186
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,110
Feng She.

187
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,350
Liuli.

188
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,150
Take him to make the antidote.

189
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,760
Yes.

190
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,350
Follow me.

191
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,640
Leader.

192
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,030
He is suspicious.

193
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,290
I’ll keep an eye on him.

194
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,000
Liuli.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,300
I take medicine every day,

196
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,490
yet I’m not getting any better.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,440
And you have to check my pulse every day.

198
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,760
Thank you.

199
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,320
Any news

200
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,960
from the leader?

201
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,030
Muyuan.

202
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,760
It’s me.

203
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,640
I’m back.

204
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,110
Xuezhi.

205
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,230
You’re back.

206
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Muyuan.

207
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,750
You suffered so much.

208
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,590
Rest assured.

209
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,880
I’ve found you the antidote

210
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,350
to cure the epidemic.

211
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,230
Once the antidote is prepared,

212
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,760
you and the people infected

213
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
can all be cured.

214
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,320
It must be very hard

215
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
to get it.

216
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,550
I didn’t go with you.

217
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,200
Sorry.

218
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,670
Muyuan.

219
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,030
Don’t say that.

220
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,230
It’s what I should do for you.

221
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,470
As long as I can get the cure for you,

222
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,640
not to mention the Divine Spirit Temple,

223
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,030
I’d go anywhere

224
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,770
no matter how dangerous it is.

225
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,000
The Divine Spirit Temple?

226
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,290
You went to the Divine Spirit Temple?

227
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
Man Feiyue is tricky

228
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,710
and ruthless.

229
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,470
There are

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
all traps around.

231
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,350
Did you get hurt?

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,200
No, I’m fine.

233
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,760
Actually, I didn’t go to

234
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
the Temple alone.

235
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,030
Master Shangguan

236
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,890
and his two friends helped me.

237
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,350
Master Shangguan

238
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,520
went together with you?

239
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,710
If not him

240
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,790
and his two chivalrous friends,

241
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,110
I’m afraid

242
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I couldn’t even get into it.

243
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,610
Not to mention getting you the antidote.

244
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,720
Good to see you back.

245
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,440
Good.

246
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,200
Let me do it.

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,320
Let me.

248
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
What’s the hurry?

249
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,280
He won’t die right now.

250
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,350
I forgot it.

251
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,550
What did you forget?

252
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,000
The most important ingredient.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,960
What is it?

254
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,550
A bowl of rootless water is needed

255
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,960
to make the antidote work.

256
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,110
Why didn't you say it earlier?

257
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,230
Anything else? Tell me all of it at once.

258
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,080
And...

259
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:01,640
Say it!

260
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,320
None.

261
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,590
Is this the so-called antidote?

262
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,080
Exactly.

263
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,110
You know the consequence of fooling us.

264
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,760
Good medicine tastes bitter.

265
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,840
Don’t you know it?

266
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,880
Alright.

267
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,350
Since you don’t trust me,

268
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
throw it away. Don’t drink it.

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,110
Give me.

270
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,610
Chief Guardian. Get up and take the medicine.

271
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Be careful. It’s hot.

272
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,350
It’s hot.

273
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,760
Actually, I’ve had

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,600
lots of medicine these days.

275
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,470
It’s OK to have this.

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,670
Just have a try.

277
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,090
How do you feel?

278
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,230
The taste isn’t bad.

279
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,840
It’s just kind of...

280
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,200
Kind of...

281
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,080
-Muyuan!
-Chief Guardian!

282
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,670
Feng She.

283
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,280
What’s wrong with the medicine?

284
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,880
-Muyuan!
-Speak!

285
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,280
I...

286
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,150
Muyuan.

287
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,840
What’s going on?

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,520
Is this the so-called antidote?

289
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,640
If anything happens to Chief Guardian,

290
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,710
I’m gonna kill you.

291
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,230
Rest assured.

292
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,110
This medicine

293
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,110
has no problem.

294
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,060
How come Muyuan is like this then?

295
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
He’s been infected for long.

296
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,480
The poison has existed for long in his body.

297
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,710
He took the medication.

298
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,790
Hot and cold energies are fighting
in his body.

299
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,520
Of course he couldn't stand it.

300
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,550
When the two energies

301
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,910
coordinate with his inner power,

302
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,960
he’ll be healed.

303
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,230
Leader. He isn’t reliable.

304
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,030
Lock him up,

305
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,000
in case he escapes.

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,350
Leader. Leader.

307
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,480
Chief Guardian's pulse is better.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Of course.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,150
I told you he’d be fine.

310
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,840
Let him have a good sleep tonight.

311
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,590
Tomorrow

312
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,970
he’ll be fine for sure.

313
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,030
Zhusha.

314
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,790
Send the antidotes to all the sects.

315
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,320
Sure.

316
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
Chequ.

317
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,030
Go and notify all the clinics in Peace County.

318
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,710
Yes.

319
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,520
Liuli.

320
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,320
Make the rest of herbs into antidotes

321
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,590
for the infected disciples.

322
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,280
Sure.

323
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,280
Beauty.

324
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,000
Drowning your sorrow.

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
Why not call me along?

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,010
Let's talk about your worries.

327
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,680
Your business is my concern.

328
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,160
Your wine

329
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,520
is also mine.

330
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,160
Just one sip of your wine.

331
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,069
How could you be so petty?

332
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,349
Are you thinking about that...

333
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,040
That man?

334
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,220
When will you go to see him?

335
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,640
Feng She.

336
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,589
You want a drink?

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,110
That’s it.

338
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,160
The way you drink

339
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,830
is quite like someone.

340
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,000
Really?

341
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,730
When I was young,

342
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,680
I thought wine

343
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,830
was bitter

344
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,210
and astringent.

345
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,480
I didn’t understand

346
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,430
why people drank this stuff

347
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,000
into their belly.

348
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,190
But now,

349
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
I seem to know it.

350
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,350
Many things

351
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
in the world

352
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,920
are more bitter

353
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,560
than wine.

354
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,000
Drinking

355
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,590
is like being human.

356
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,110
Isn’t it good to be carefree?

357
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,640
Your father knows this.

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
But I don’t think you do.

359
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,760
How so?

360
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,920
You’re drinking alone here.

361
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,150
You must have unsolved worries.

362
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,610
You want to solve your worries

363
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,460
but you don’t know how to do it.

364
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,350
Am I right?

365
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,040
I don’t know much about the martial arts world.

366
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,310
But I do know

367
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,640
we should be grateful.

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,280
I hate myself so much.

Why am I so useless

372
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,110
that I need others to bear everything for me?

373
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,710
Actually,

374
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,310
I envy you.

375

Do you?

376
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,820
What do you envy me for?

377
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,920
You should pay what you owe.

378
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,520
That’s exactly what life is.

379
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,290
And that’s why life is fun.

380

Not like me.

381
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,130
My father abandoned me.

382
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,560
Man Feiyue adopted me.

383
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,760
That’s how I got here.

384
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,110
She used me, tricked me,

385
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,340
and never taught me love and righteousness.

386
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,820
I don’t even know what I'm living for.

387
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,090
Luckily, I met you guys,

Do you feel

391
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,590
you are lonely?

392
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,010
You can get used to it over time.

393

So,

403

why are you complaining about yourself here?

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,520
Be carefree.

Your choice is nothing about right or wrong,

but about your inner heart.

you were saved by my good skills.

How dare you disrespect our Chief Guardian?

I didn’t disrespect him.

Your leader said this is my home.

438

I called him buddy. Is it wrong?

439

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
will restore its state in the world.

528
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,910
Let me see the leader!

529
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,430
Let me see the leader!

530
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,800
The witch Chong Xuezhi practiced Nine Moves of Lotus God

531
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
and killed my leader.

532
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,640
Mr. Lin, please uphold justice for my leader.

533
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,890
Tell me the details.

534
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,160
The other day,

535
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,830
the leader died suddenly.

536
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,350
We searched for the killer all around.

537
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,310
Then we learned

538
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,710
that Chong Xuezhi mastered the Nine Moves,

539
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,710
and we got to know

540
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,400
it’s she who killed the leader.

541
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,830
Did you see

542
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,550
Chong Xuezhi show up?

543
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,710
No.

544
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,560
Please look at the five-petal lotus.

545
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,400
In the world,

546
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,470
only she can play the Nine Moves.

547
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,950
Who else could it be if not her?

548
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,000
That said,

549
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,690
you didn’t see it yourself.

550
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,660
Don’t jump to the conclusion.

551
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,560
Rest assured.

552
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,000
I’ll do my utmost to look into it

553
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
and catch the killer.

554

I’ll give you a satisfactory answer.

557

I don’t hope you act rashly

558
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,480
before I find out the killer.

559
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,010
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

560
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,040
My leader died suspiciously.

561
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,760
We hope Mr. Lin can figure it out

562
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
and avenge his death.

566

You met Mr. Tie Xiao

567

before he died.

568
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,450
You should know something.

571
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,110
What do you think of

572
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Tie Xiao’s death?

573
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
Mr. Tie

574
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,830
is narrow-minded

575
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,400
and rude.

576
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,800
I think

577
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,500
he could be killed by his enemies.

578
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,070
There’s another possibility

579
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,590
that

580
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,920
the murderer

581
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,760
asked him for the Green Spring Elixir

582
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,760
and was rejected,

583
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,170
which made the murderer kill him.

584
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
If the murderer

585
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,590
was Chong Xuezhi,

586
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,930
what do you think

587
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,880
we should do?

588
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,020
This case must be investigated thoroughly.

589
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,560
If it was done by Chong Xuezhi,

590
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,410
we shouldn't cover her up.

591
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,800
But if Mr. Tie did things wrong at first,

592
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,380
we shouldn’t get Xuezhi wronged.

593
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,830
I know.

What?

My father sent me here

to thank you, Imperial Advisor.

714

Hadn’t you worshiped the Gods

715
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,630
and eliminated the plague,

Your Highness, I’m flattered.

My tricks

and worshiping gods and ancestors.

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,030
Actually, the plague wasn’t

723

ended by Gods.

Tell me

how you ended the epidemic.

735

On my father’s orders,

736
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,710
I went to Peace County to investigate

737
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,760
and found the origin of the epidemic

738
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,610
was the Divine Spirit Temple.

739
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,470
But rest assured, Your Highness.

740
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,840
I’ve settled it, and found the cure

741

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,950
Good.

of Master Shangguan,

876
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,320
What's your name, sir?

877
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,000
Lin Changran.

878
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,710
Lin Changran?

879
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,190
Mr. Lin.

880
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,320
Greetings, Mr. Lin.

881
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,710
You know me?

882
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,000
-I heard of you.
-I heard of you.

883
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,870
-We heard of you a lot.
-The leader is inside.

884
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:03,930
-Please.
-Please.

885
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,520
These arrows

886
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,670
are for the court.

887
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,710
It’s originally a specialty in Longquan.

888
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,520
Now

889
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,080
we can make it as well.

890
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,520
Xuezhi.

891
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,080
Uncle!

892
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,510
Uncle, what brings you here?

893
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,330
I’m here to congratulate you.

894
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,320
Mr. Lin.

895
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,470
Congratulate me?

896
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,000
You wiped out the Divine Spirit Temple

897
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,930
and found the cure of the epidemic.

898
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,560
People outside

899
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,040
see you as the Goddess saving all the beings.

900
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,840
Uncle.

901
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,700
You are not here

902
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,560
just congratulating me, right?

903
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,640
Of course not.

904
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,670
I’m gonna stay here for more days

905
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,320
and see how you have restored

906
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,380
the Hall of Flames.

907
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,360
Great.

908
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,230
I will

909
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,950
make some good dishes for you.

910
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,710
Can you cook?

911
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,190
At least she won’t get dishes burnt.

912
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,520
Xuezhi.

913
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,710
Muyuan.

914
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,360
Actually, I have

915
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,380
something important to tell you.

916
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,130
There are no outsiders now.

917
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,080
I can tell you without concern.

918
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,560
Uncle. What is it?

919
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,840
I thought

920
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,560
you didn’t have to

921
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,490
learn too much about your fathers.

922
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
You’d have burden

923
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,470
if you knew it.

924
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,290
But if I didn’t tell you anything,

925
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,080
you’d never know

926
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,870
the truth.

927
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,320
I thought it over

928
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,320
and still decided to tell you.

929
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,190
Mr. Lin.

930
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,080
I know

931
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,650
you have your plans.

932
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,950
Since we can’t change

933
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,040
the things of our fathers,

934
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,870
why not just let them go?
