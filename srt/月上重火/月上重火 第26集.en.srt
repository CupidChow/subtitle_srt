00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 26

4
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Do you

5
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,680
have friends in the Hall of Flames?

6
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,630
Your grandfather…

7
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,490
I know you hate the Hall of Flames.

8
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,320
I wish you'd stop going after them.

9
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,190
They're not bad people.

10
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,240
They won’t give Huashan Sect a hard time.

11
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,160
It seems you

12
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,790
and Chong Xuezhi have a special relationship.

13
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,780
They are really nice to me.

14
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,880
I grew up without a family or friends.

15
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,520
Now,

16
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,880
they're my friends.

17
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,030
I don't want to see you...

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,940
you fight each other to the death.

19
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,750
It looks like

20
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,240
you are winning again.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,080
It's my birthday,

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,520
and you're not having a good time.

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
You’re letting me win again.

24
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,520
Don’t be so humble.

25
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,520
It’s alright if I lost the first round.

26
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,380
But it’s already the second time.

27
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,960
You are indeed good at this.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
You’re holding your energy.

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,750
I’m ashamed of myself.

30
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,320
I was just hiding my poor skills.

31
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,390
Lord is losing again.

32
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,520
Father, why don't you let His Highness win?

33
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,470
Don't blame the Imperial Advisor.

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
A good competitor makes it interesting.

35
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,670
I told the Imperial Advisor to go all out.

36
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,400
Being a prince doesn't mean I should be indulged.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
You’re here, Tou.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,160
Your Highness.

39
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,560
That’s alright.

40
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,960
We’re family.

41
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,240
Zheng.

42
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,470
I'm getting hungry.

43
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Why don't you go

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,829
check on the food?

45
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,110
Sure.

46
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,070
Please enjoy your game then. I’ll go check.

47
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,000
Be careful.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
I’m going with my sister.

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,240
Sure.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,830
Tou.

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,470
Why don’t you stay with us?

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,880
Yes.

53
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,390
Go.

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,940
Imperial Advisor.

55
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,510
A few days ago,

56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,200
my father asked about the border pay.

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,200
You've given me a problem.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,760
Now a new one.

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,960
I don't know what to do about it.

60
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,000
You must be joking.

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
I only do things for His Majesty’s sake,

62
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,110
for the crown prince’s sake,

63
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,880
and for your sake.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,760
How dare I cause you problems?

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,000
Tou.

66
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,920
See?

67
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,880
Imperial Advisor said

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,320
he wasn't going to make it difficult for me,

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,159
but in fact,

70
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,480
he ate a lot of my pieces.

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,390
Do you think

72
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,200
I should believe him or not?

73
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,670
I am not a man of the court.

74
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,200
I know nothing about it.

75
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,230
As for the game,

76
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,920
I can’t talk during observation.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm afraid

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't help you.

79
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,440
We are family.

80
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,160
You can speak your mind.

81
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
In that case,

82
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,090
Your Highness,

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
you can try it here.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
This move…

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,070
It’s a good one.

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
It brings my pieces back to life.

87
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,830
Congratulations.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
You win.

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,510
Thanks to Tou’s help.

90
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,920
Tou’s skills

91
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,200
are a little better than yours.

92
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,510
In the future,

93
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,270
I shall learn more from Tou.

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,700
You’re flattering me.

95
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,950
When you play with my father,

96
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,440
you can see ten steps ahead.

97
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,830
I’m not that good.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,670
I can only see this move in front of me.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,880
Looks like

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,600
Tou is the one holding his strength.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
I’m having a good time today.

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Later at the banquet,

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,670
I shall drink more

104
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,000
with you and Tou.

105
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I have prepared fine wine for you.

106
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,270
Your wine

107
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,950
is surely prepared for me?

108
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,880
Not

109
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,760
for my brother?

110
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,230
Don’t be nervous.

111
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,110
I’m just joking.

112
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,670
You what?

113
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,880
I’m telling you.

114
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,510
Don't ever say

115
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,270
you're Chief's son out there.

116
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,950
You have no shame,

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,440
but father does.

118
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,830
You’d better stay in your stables,

119
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,600
lest you should be talked about.

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,640
Haven't you

121
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,390
embarrassed Chief enough already?

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,600
In Winehouse of Fairyland,

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,830
who was being held like a chicken

124
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,510
in the dark room?

125
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,620
I'm warning you, Feng She!

126
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,510
If you say anything else,

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
I’ll cut your tongue!

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,550
I…

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What is this?

130
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,520
Nothing, a mistake.

131
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,720
Doesn’t matter.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's just some special lime powder.

133
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,000
Helps you wash your eyes.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,390
You!

135
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,950
So you can see who I am!

136
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,110
You!

137
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,550
I’ve heard that things are

138
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,159
more interesting out there than in the palace.

139
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,760
You helped

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,090
the Imperial Advisor with the fever thing

141
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
and swept away the cult Divine Spirit Temple.

142
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,390
I’m impressed.

143
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,760
Last time,

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
my father

145
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,920
happened to be at the festival,

146
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,040
so I helped him temporarily.

147
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,390
It's not a big deal.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,640
What's the twisted story here?

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
Tell me about it.

150
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,270
There is no story.

151
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,040
It's just a bunch of

152
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,000
lowlifes running amok.

153
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,830
It's a shame

154
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,790
it cost so many innocent lives

155
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,440
in Peace County.

156
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,200
Lowlifes indeed.

157
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
What a shame!

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm not much help

159
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,000
in this matter.

160
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,160
You have done much

161
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,550
to protect Xiangzhou.

162
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,320
My father gave me Xiangzhou.

163
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,760
It's nothing compared with Tou.

164
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,150
The management of one piece of the land

165
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,909
has long made me uneasy.

166
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,450
And I'm afraid of failing His Majesty.

167
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,470
Unlike Tou,

168
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:43,530
temporary help

169
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,640
can wipe out a big sect.

170
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,170
If he becomes serious,

171
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,810
he might achieve something world-shaking.

172
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,000
He is not capable of that.

173
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,950
Not only something that big,

174
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,760
he even rejects

175
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
staying here longer.

176
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,710
Every day, he cries to go back to

177
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,200
his peaceful Moon Valley.

178
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,470
I raised this son

179
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,790
for nothing.

180
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,440
Don’t say that.

181
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,790
Tou came back for your birthday,

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,670
which means in his mind,

183
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,070
you have a certain place.

184
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,030
He might come back to help you

185
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,080
one day.

186
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,520
Right.

187
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Tou.

188
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,230
I’ve heard

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,280
the Hall of Flames is a cult.

190
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,440
Everyone in the world should fight against it.

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,910
Is that true?

192
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,200
From what I know,

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,720
the Hall is skilled at forging weapons.

194
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,400
The court also has its support.

195
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,710
It’s not a cult.

196
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Just some rumor.

197
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,200
Besides,

198
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,030
last time, Yinzhang twelve canals flooded.

199
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,710
Leader Chong Xuezhi

200
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,400
helped you and me in the disaster relief.

201
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,230
Your Highness must remember this.

202
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,110
I do have a special memory

203
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,670
of this Leader Chong.

204
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Oh, right.

205
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,030
I also heard

206
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,710
you and the leader of the Hall

207
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,320
seem to be very close.

208
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,030
Is that true?

209
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,880
What kind of rumor is that?

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,400
Leader Chong

211
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,400
is nothing to me but

212
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,150
my savior’s daughter.

213
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,790
I was also entrusted

214
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,640
to protect her for a while.

215
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,960
Nothing more.

216
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,400
Another rumor.

217
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,670
I thought the Shangguan family

218
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,400
is having another happy event.

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,440
When you just mentioned it,

220
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,350
I was happy, too.

221
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,520
But now,

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,460
nothing happened in fact.

223
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,710
I wonder if you have thought about

224
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Tou’s marriage.

225
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,880
My son

226
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,880
grew up young.

227
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,350
He's willing to

228
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,040
make his own decisions about everything.

229
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,330
As for his marriage,

230
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,190
it’s better he makes the decisions as well.

231
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,720
I only hope that,

232
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,640
like you and Zheng,

233
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,790
he and his wife are fond of each other

234
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,190
and have a good marriage.

235
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,760
That's all I want.

236
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, since we are here,

237
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,880
Tou,

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,710
now tell me,

239
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,790
what kind of girl you like

240
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,550
so that your father and I

241
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,110
can help you find her.

242
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,760
I don’t like any girl yet.

243
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,960
No?

244
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,520
But I heard that

245
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,080
the daughter of uncle Lin Zongxing,

246
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,200
Lin Fengzi…

247
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,400
I have nothing to do with Miss Lin!

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,960
Tou!

249
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,350
Don’t be rude.

250
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,590
It’s alright.

251
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,960
We’re family.

252
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,470
But as Tou said,

253
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,850
the rumor out there can’t be trusted.

254
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,150
As a prince,

255
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,450
I live in the palace,

256
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,000
so there’re a lot of things I don’t know.

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
That’s why I’m so curious

258
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,250
about the world out there.

259
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,230
Forgive me, Your Highness.

260
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,360
I said it’s alright.

261
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,720
Don’t worry about it.

262
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,110
About all these things,

263
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,640
after I heard them from Tou,

264
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
I’m more interested.

265
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,690
Living in the palace for so long

266
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,200
makes me interested in the world.

267
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,800
Things out there are true and false mixed.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,880
Just like folklore books.

269
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,910
No wonder my two uncles

270
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,590
don’t live like princes and throw themselves

271
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,320
into the world of martial arts.

272
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,580
[Huashan Sect]

273
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,550
Now everyone's talking about

274
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,410
Feng She that came out of nowhere.

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,660
Do you really want to go public

276
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,430
with the fact that he's your long-lost son?

277
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,280
Putting things off is not the way to go.

278
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,610
Cheng, what do you mean by that?

279
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,710
Do you really think I keep him here

280
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,520
for a real father-son reunion?

281
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,060
His relationship with Chong Xuezhi is special.

282
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,550
It will be of use to us in the future.

283
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,080
Have you figured out what to do?

284
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,760
I had a great time chatting with

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you and Tou.

286
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,960
But it's getting late.

287
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,670
If I don't leave soon,

288
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,170
I'll run into the crown prince.

289
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,470
I don't want to break that taboo.

290
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,430
Zheng hasn’t been in Dongdu for a long time.

291
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,030
Now we’ve been here for your birthday,

292
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,670
Zheng and I will stay a few more days.

293
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,590
Tou.

294
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,750
When I get the chance,

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,120
I’ll learn more about the go game

296
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,710
from you.

297
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
You flatter me.

298
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,030
Father.

299
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,280
Tou.

300
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,160
Take care of yourselves.

301
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,470
You too, sister.

302
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,400
Tou.

303
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,110
In your opinion,

304
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,490
why would he care about the martial art world?

305
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,590
Could it be that Lord Lu

306
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,440
has been in the court for so long that

307
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,900
he is curious about the affairs of the world?

308
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,150
I’ve worked with him for many years.

309
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,550
I know he isn't like that.

310
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,790
He's testing you.

311
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,790
Testing me?

312
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,640
He learned go game from Master Miaohua.

313
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,110
You think he wouldn't know

314
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,640
the move you tell him?

315
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,350
I was reckless.

316
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,960
If I'm right,

317
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,000
Lord Lu will come for you

318
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
again soon.

319
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,790
I just want to remind you.

320
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,060
When you’re facing the royal family,

321
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,670
even if you’re a relative,

322
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,320
you still need to be very careful.

323
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,900
Whether you become an officer or not,

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you are a subject of the emperor.

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
Loyalty

326
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,590
must come before everything.

327
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,520
Remember that.

328
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,550
I understand.

329
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,470
I

330
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,440
didn’t expect that

331
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,150
you'd be here too.

332
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,170
About what I told you last time,

333
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,730
have you considered it?

334
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

335
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,320
It's just…

336
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm used to living a life of leisure.

337
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,350
If I suddenly enter the officialdom,

338
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,030
I'm afraid

339
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I’ll do you and father no good.

340
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,410
I have no intention.

341
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,960
Right.

342
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,840
Your Highness.

343
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,640
My son’s lived in the outside world for so long.

344
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,110
He does not have the means to serve you.

345
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,470
I hope you don’t blame him.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,790
How could I?

347
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,910
I admire people

348
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,840
like Master Shangguan the most, who are

349
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,440
determined and unmoved by fame and fortune.

350
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,400
If he had easily consented to me,

351
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,110
I might think that

352
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,110
I have misjudged him.

353
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,520
But,

354
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,350
I have to say,

355
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,540
you’re the Imperial Advisor.

356
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,960
Your birthday banquet is too simply.

357
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,710
I knew that you were coming today,

358
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,960
so I refused other guests,

359
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,910
in case they disturb Your Highness.

360
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,550
How thoughtful of you!

361
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,470
Did Lord Lu

362
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,530
come here earlier?

363
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,470
Lord Lu was here.

364
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,640
My daughter hasn’t seen me for a long time,

365
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,520
so he brought her to me in advance.

366
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,150
I haven’t seen him

367
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,840
for a long time too.

368
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
Is everything alright with him?

369
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,829
All is well with Lord Lu.

370
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,109
Safe and sound.

371
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
Lord Lu

372
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,880
has mentioned about His Majesty

373
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,470
and you many times.

374
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,589
That’s a relief.

375
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,800
Lord Lu

376
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,650
lives in Xiangzhou.

377
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
I’ve been worried about him.

378
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,040
Especially his health.

379
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,430
It’s a blessing for the country that you and

380
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,040
Lord Lu care for each other so much.

381
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,280
Now

382
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,290
the world is at peace

383
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,100
and everything goes well.

384
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,010
It's all because of

385
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,560
loyalists like you

386
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,230
protecting the country.

387
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,470
You are too kind.

388
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,950
In my opinion,

389
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,230
it is because of the wisdom of His Majesty

390
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,800
and a crown prince like you caring for the people.

391
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,040
So

392
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,590
things are so peaceful today.

393
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,980
Master Shangguan.

394
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,400
There's one thing I don’t understand.

395
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,470
So I want to ask you.

396
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,280
Yes, please.

397
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,040
In every peaceful time,

398
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,070
men

399
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,920
would want to become an official.

400
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,070
While

401
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,470
in times of war,

402
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,430
men would want to hide from the court

403
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,430
and become a hero.

404
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,590
But you, Master Shangguan,

405
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,320
you live in this peaceful time,

406
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,000
yet you don’t want to be an official

407
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,310
but a hero living a leisure life.

408
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
Why is that?

409
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,520
Being an official

410
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,590
or a hero

411
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,770
is actually

412
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,640
not my intention.

413
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,800
I know myself.

414
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
These rumors in the world

415
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,640
are nothing but a moment

416
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,070
of talk.

417
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,350
A gentleman never teaches by words.

418
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,560
A wise man never shows off books.

419
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,880
In this time of prosperity,

420
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
people come and go.

421
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,590
They come for common benefits

422
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,320
and go because of no interests.

423
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,610
There are few men

424
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,560
like you who have no desire.

425
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,110
They say

426
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,440
a man with no desire is stronger.

427
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,860
I'm getting really

428
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,680
curious about you.

429
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,830
You flatter me.

430
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,110
Ordinary people, naturally,

431
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,950
seek fame and fortune.

432
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,000
But

433
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,840
I grew up in an Imperial Advisor’s home.

434
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,780
Maybe I've been

435
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,590
used to it since I was a child,

436
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,230
so

437
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,800
I don't feel it's new.

438
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
If it’s like you said,

439
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,210
I was born into the house of royals,

440
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,640
then I should have no desire.

441
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,570
That's not true.

442
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,940
You have the world on your shoulders.

443
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,800
If you have no desire,

444
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,070
the people

445
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,760
may suffer.

446
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,430
Tou.

447
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
Don’t be rude!

448
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,640
Master Shangguan is right.

449
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,140
Shangguan Tou.

450
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,070
I will remember your advice.

451
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,890
I will try my best to

452
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,110
keep the people safe

453
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,040
and the world peaceful.

454
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,590
To Your Highness.

455
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,040
Tou.

456
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,760
His Highness is considerate of the people

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,110
and a rare crown prince.

458
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,110
He appreciates you.

459
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,950
If you're lucky enough to serve him,

460
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,560
it'll be

461
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,400
a great honor for our family.

462
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,420
Your Highness.

463
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
I can't hold my liquor. Excuse me.

464
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,570
Your Highness.

465
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,000
Living outside for long made him have no manners.

466
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,350
Please forgive him.

467
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,870
It’s alright.

468
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,310
Rules are not necessary today.

469
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,230
Come.

470
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,790
Let’s keep drinking.

471
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Your Highness.

472
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I just got a bottle of wine the other day.

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,130
Allow me to bring it.

474
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,430
Please wait.

475
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,310
Take your time.

476
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,190
Tou.

477
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,270
How could you be so rude just now?

478
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,730
What do you want me to do?

479
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,800
Like you,

480
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,280
keep the crown prince company

481
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,350
and go social?

482
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,820
That's not what I mean.

483
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,000
But what you just said was rude.

484
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
If it were not for the prince's generosity,

485
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,560
you would be punished!

486
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,160
So.

487
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,920
You're afraid I've

488
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,560
offended my future master,

489
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,110
right?

490
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,710
Tou!

491
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,280
Father.

492
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,110
You're the Imperial Advisor now.

493
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,250
The highest power you can have.

494
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,300
And you are the crown prince's favorite.

495
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,470
Even my sister married Lord Lu.

496
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,920
You have all the power and position you want.

497
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,190
What more do you want?

498
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,040
Do you want me to become an official

499
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,110
like you,

500
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
and work for the royals all my life?

501
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,710
You!

502
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,800
Tou!

503
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,110
Tou!

504
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,230
I didn’t mean to.

505
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,920
Tou!

506
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Father.

507
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,590
You are a selfish man.

508
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,430
Back then,

509
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,050
if you hadn't been so greedy for power,

510
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,130
my mother wouldn't have been killed.

511
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,450
I’m telling you.

512
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,680
I'll never

513
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,430
be an official in my life.

514
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,710
Because

515
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,150
I'll always remember

516
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,230
how my mother died.

517
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,350
I thought you forgave me.

518
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,110
Why do you still see me like that?

519
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,560
She was my mother.

520
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,520
How can I forgive you so easily?

521
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,090
According to my father,

522
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,190
when you

523
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,470
just entered the court,

524
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,710
you were untamed and straightforward.

525
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Even in the presence of His Majesty,

526
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,560
you were fearless.

527
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,040
As I see it today,

528
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Master Shangguan

529
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,590
is the same as you

530
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,330
when you were that age.

531
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,800
I want him

532
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,280
to be less like me.

533
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,220
Master Shangguan.

534
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,110
Lord Lu said your go skills were excellent.

535
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,310
He didn’t have enough time earlier,

536
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,880
so he would like to invite you

537
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,340
to his place and teach him.

538
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,410
Master Shangguan.

539
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,070
Please.

540
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
Young Master.

541
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,040
A letter for you.

542
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,230
Please tell Lord Lu that

543
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,360
Shangguan Tou has a sudden emergency.

544
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,310
The game has to wait for now.

545
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,640
When this matter is settled,

546
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,570
I shall go in person and apologize.

547
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,570
Your Highness.

548
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,920
He is here?

549
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,190
Your Highness.

550
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,880
Master Shangguan received a letter.

551
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,070
He said it was important.

552
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,880
When the matter is settled,

553
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,280
he will come for the game.

554
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,800
He asked me to apologize to you.

555
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,680
Then

556
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,430
he ran off.

557
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,950
Important?

558
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,920
What is it about?

559
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,430
I saw chaos in the Imperial Advisor mansion.

560
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,760
A lot of silver were moved out of back door.

561
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,560
Like they were going somewhere.

562
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,850
All right, I got it. Off you go.

563
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,920
Wait.

564
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,760
Have someone keep an eye on Master Shangguan.

565
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
Don't let him run wild out there.

566
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
I'm still waiting for him

567
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,760
to come back and play.

568
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,070
Yes.

569
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,040
Master Shangguan.

570
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,710
This is not a game

571
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,710
you can leave

572
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,350
that easily.

573
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,060
[Hall of Flames]

574
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,640
Xuezhi.

575
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,830
I've brought

576
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,230
some silver

577
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
and some craftsmen from Dongdu.

578
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,730
They’re in Zhusha's hands now.

579
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,880
I hope it

580
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,230
would help you with your emergency.

581
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,230
I have no reason

582
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,710
to accept your things.

583
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,020
Please take them back.

584
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,920
Don't worry.

585
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,640
This time,

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,350
I’m here on behalf of the Imperial Advisor,

587
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,710
to offer kindness to the martial arts world,

588
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,470
not out of selfishness.

589
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,070
The Hall of Flames

590
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,100
has trouble making blades

591
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
for the royal family.

592
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,680
We are

593
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
supposed to help.

594
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
None of this stuff

595
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,480
is from Moon Valley.

596
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,680
You can take them.

597
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:02,950
What?

598
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,430
Has the Imperial Advisor's kindness

599
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,640
come to our Hall of Flames

600
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,280
from Dongdu?

601
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,000
Xuezhi.

602
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,430
This is an emergency.

603
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,070
Let's just take them.

604
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,930
We'll deal with him later.

605
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,920
Uncle.

606
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,770
Why did you bring him here?

607
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,470
You suddenly asked me for help.

608
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,520
You think I’m a prince?

609
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,230
I’m just an ordinary man.

610
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,520
I want to help you.

611
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
But there's nothing I can do.

612
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,160
Xuezhi.

613
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,710
Listen to him.

614
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,160
It's important to solve the problem.

615
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,360
Don't get emotional.

616
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Fine.

617
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,310
Thank you, Master Shangguan,

618
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,770
and the Imperial Advisor.

619
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,830
I’ll take them.

620
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,430
And when my Hall of Flames

621
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,920
is through this,

622
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,000
I will return them all.

623
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Fine.

624
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,710
Whatever you say.

625
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
This time,

626
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,190
I sent the letter

627
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,110
not because I wanted to see

628
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,800
you two against each other in front of me.

629
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,520
Xuezhi.

630
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,400
About Sword Manor,

631
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Tou told me.

632
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,400
Uncle.

633
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,350
There’re a lot of things

634
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,520
waiting for me.

635
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,760
Right now,

636
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't have any free time

637
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,280
to look into the past.

638
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,920
Look into?

639
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,790
Of course you should.

640
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,800
Mr. Lin.

641
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,920
Xuezhi.

642
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,280
Other than making blades,

643
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is there anything else

644
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,070
I can do for you?

645
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,280
You have helped me enough.

646
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,280
If there's more,

647
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,370
I'm afraid I can't pay it back.

648
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,950
All right.

649
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
No more talking.

650
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Xuezhi.

651
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,070
Well,

652
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,110
Tou and I have come a long way.

653
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,840
We'll be back in a little while.

654
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,920
You can serve us a meal, right?

655
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,710
Mr. Lin.

656
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,200
I have a game appointment with Lord Lu.

657
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm afraid

658
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,730
I won't be able to accompany you

659
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,370
and Xuezhi for the meal.

660
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,590
Since when did Master Shangguan

661
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,350
and Lord Lu become friends?

662
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,590
I just want

663
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,160
to see my sister.

664
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,280
This time seeing sister,

665
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,310
she asked about you.

666
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,680
Thanks for her care.

667
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,590
But I’m used to

668
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,920
stumbling and falling,

669
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,080
and I like to face difficulties.

670
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,350
I will never give up

671
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,520
even if there are more problems,

672
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
let alone making blades.

673
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,160
Xuezhi.

674
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,130
They’re osmanthus cakes I brought from Dongdu.

675
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,310
I think

676
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
you haven’t had them for a long time.

677
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,400
You might

678
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,710
miss them.

679
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,070
Take them.

680
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,470
See, he is considerate.

681
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,070
Xuezhi likes it.

682
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,590
So do I.

683
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,160
I…I’ll take them for now.

684
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,230
Mr. Lin.

685
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,470
I’m

686
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,430
leaving now.

687
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,470
Alright.

688
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,130
Master Shangguan.

689
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,680
I wonder who is better at go game,

690
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,920
you or Lord Lu?

691
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,350
Lord Lu

692
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,090
studied from the Master of Go.

693
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,800
I’m no match for him.

694
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,070
Since you can't beat him,

695
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,520
then you need to

696
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,900
be more careful with your pieces.

697
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,830
Not only see your opponent,

698
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,590
but also know

699
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
the whole game.

700
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,130
Take care, Master Shangguan.

701
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,780
I'll keep that in mind.

702
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,680
See you.

703
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,520
Your Highness.

704
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Master Shangguan is here to see you.

705
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,000
He didn't see you

706
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,680
following him, right?

707
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,230
Rest assured, Your Highness.

708
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,590
Master Shangguan was in such a hurry

709
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,990
that he didn't notice me.

710
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,190
How was

711
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,710
his trip?

712
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,190
All I know is that

713
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,310
he sent both the money and his men

714
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,510
to the Hall of Flames.

715
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,880
Too many guards there.

716
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,140
I could not get inside.

717
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,640
I don't know how it went.

718
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,950
But he

719
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,350
came back empty-handed.

720
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
The Hall of Flames

721
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,840
must have taken them.

722
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,590
Master Shangguan went to the Hall of Flames

723
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,720
with men and silver?

724
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,880
What kind of men?

725
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,140
Did you see them clear?

726
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,170
Just ordinary men.

727
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,590
Big and tall.

728
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,920
That’s

729
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,880
all I can see.

730
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,040
Alright, I see.

731
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,520
Get

732
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
Master Shangguan

733
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,590
and meet me in the lobby.

734
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,680
Off you go.

735
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,520
Yes.

736
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,390
Why do you think about

737
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,070
Master Shangguan’s trip to

738
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,040
the Hall of Flames with

739
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,460
his men and silver?

740
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,880
I heard

741
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,190
the Hall of Flames recently got

742
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,050
a difficult blade-making order.

743
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,310
It's a smart move

744
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,040
for Leader Chong.

745
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,110
I just didn't expect that

746
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,440
Master Shangguan would

747
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,280
rather go there to help

748
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,570
than show up for your appointment.

749
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
So you're saying

750
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,560
that

751
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
Tou and the Hall of Flames

752
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,110
are close.

753
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,110
Well…

754
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,920
Depends on what you think.

755
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,450
I wouldn't dare to presume.

756
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,350
But

757
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,310
Imperial Advisor was generous.

758
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,230
I heard

759
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,190
when they were packing,

760
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,330
the crown prince

761
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,080
was still in the Imperial Advisor Mansion.

762
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,230
It's a shame

763
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,430
you weren’t there at the right time.

764
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
If you were there and

765
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,000
made it work,

766
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,310
the reputation of helping the outside world

767
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,880
would be helpful someday.

768
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,430
So you’re saying

769
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,610
the Hall of Flames took things

770
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,310
because of my brother?

771
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,430
My apology.

772
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,630
I've never heard of

773
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,400
crown prince having anything to do with them.

774
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,290
If they want to be grateful,

775
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,190
they must

776
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,429
thank Master Shangguan.

777
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,630
Get up.

778
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

779
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,560
I know my brother

780
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,510
is not interested in the world of martial arts.

781
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,370
Do you think the Hall of Flames

782
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,949
would appreciate it

783
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,190
if I sent

784
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
something there?

785
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,350
Chief Guardian Mu certainly wouldn't.

786
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,429
But I’m not sure about

787
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
Leader Chong.

788
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,360
See?

789
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,300
More complicated now.

790
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,870
Thinking behind

791
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,159
is no better than

792
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,520
asking to face.

793
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,950
You are wise.

794
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,760
But,

795
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,360
asking people from the outside world to fiefdom,

796
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,040
others may think…

797
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,870
If we could get Leader Chong to Dongdu,

798
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,390
it would be great.

799
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,620
Tou.

800
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,900
I hope you don't mind.

801
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,780
that I asked you to come here.

802
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,180
I’m not going to do

803
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,600
what my brother did to you.

804
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,080
Besides, Xiangzhou is the only place I have.

805
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,000
You're too good

806
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,430
to be there.

807
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,280
You’re a royal member.

808
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,390
I am

809
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,800
just an ordinary man.

810
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,270
How dare I compare myself to you?

811
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,520
Tou.

812
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,360
I just want to know,

813
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,910
in your mind,

814
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,800
what the world

815
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,760
is supposed to be like.

816
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,910
I used to wish

817
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,600
the world

818
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,800
could be free of strife and oppression.

819
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,710
Everyone was happy.

820
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,950
The world

821
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,470
was a scene of prosperity.

822
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,560
But later

823
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
I came to understand that

824
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,670
it wasn't

825
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,000
really about

826
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,760
what I wanted.

827
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,910
What do you want

828
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,870
now?

829
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,230
Peace.

830
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,870
And go with the flow.

831
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,150
Good.

832
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,320
What you want is the greater harmony.

833
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,230
What if I tell you

834
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,520
that I have a way

835
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,600
to achieve this?

836
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,430
Would you

837
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,170
do something for it?

838
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,630
I wonder what way

839
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,970
you are talking about.

840
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,470
It looks like I’m winning.

841
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,630
Your Highness.

842
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,710
Sister.

843
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,970
Zheng, you’re here.

844
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,000
Your Highness.

845
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,870
Tou just arrived

846
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,870
and played this with you for so long.

847
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,630
Tou.

848
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,870
You should spend some time with me.

849
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,560
Sure.

850
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,560
Whatever you say.

851
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,190
Tou.

852
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,920
Go spend time with your sister.

853
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,000
We’ll

854
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,750
continue this game another day.

855
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,600
Yes, Your Highness.

856
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,470
Here.

857
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,390
Have some tea.

858
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:25,920
Alright.

859
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,260
How do you like this place?

860
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,190
The decor is simple and elegant.

861
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,910
Kind of like my Moon Valley.

862
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,870
That's new.

863
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,760
Lord Lu arranged everything.

864
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,320
Looks like you two have a lot in common.

865
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,470
Sister.

866
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,150
Are you

867
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,080
enjoying

868
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,930
your time in Xiangzhou?

869
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,120
Is there something wrong?

870
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,710
Why would there be something wrong?

871
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,360
Why do you think so?

872
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,710
I was just thinking

873
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,370
that the house of royals

874
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,360
might have something not that peaceful.

875
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,290
I'm afraid you might be neglected.

876
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,430
I see.

877
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,520
But don’t worry.

878
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,810
Lord Lu has been very kind to me.

879
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Sister.

880
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,080
What kind of man

881
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,150
is Lord Lu?

882
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,520
He is

883
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,230
simple

884
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,470
and hardworking.

885
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,000
When he’s not working,

886
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,710
he reads books and plays Go.

887
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,470
He doesn’t have bad habits

888
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,930
like other royal members.

889
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,460
And he doesn’t put on airs.

890
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,870
And most importantly,

891
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,630
he promised me

892
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,470
he would never

893
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,710
take a concubine.

894
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,000
As long as he lives up to you,

895
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'll be relieved.

896
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:54,840
Tou.

897
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,430
Do you think

898
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,760
that father forced me

899
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,800
to marry Lord Lu?

900
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,080
It was actually my idea.

901
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,950
I am happy

902
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,230
with him.

903
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
The only thing that is not good

904
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,560
it that Xiangzhou

905
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,800
is in the north.

906
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,320
It’s colder

907
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
than here.

908
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,000
I wasn’t very comfortable with that.

909
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,920
The southwest is unfavorable.

910
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,710
The northeast is ominous.

911
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,330
The southwest is unfavorable.

912
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,980
The northeast is ominous.

913
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,630
Sister.

914
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,150
Do you really

915
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,670
know Lord Lu?

916
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,950
Lord Lu has his identity,

917
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,560
his affairs,

918
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,360
and his own reasons.

919
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,630
I can't guarantee

920
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,320
that I know him completely.

921
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,650
But I'm willing to face anything with him.

922
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,680
Lord Lu is so lucky to have you

923
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,280
with him.

924
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,120
Don't just envy him.

925
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,870
Tell me about yourself.

926
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,920
How are things going with you and Ms. Chong?

927
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,910
I was

928
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,630
planning to take her

929
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,600
to father’s 50th birthday.

930
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,360
But

931
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
something happened,

932
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,890
and it didn’t work out.

933
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
What is it?

934
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,390
What's going on?

935
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,630
It's

936
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,360
a complicated matter.

937
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,080
We both need to calm down.

938
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,360
Then,

939
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,120
I’ll explain it to her.

940
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,150
I don't know

941
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,950
what's going on between you two.

942
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,800
But I know how women feel.

943
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,930
What she needs now is not calming down,

944
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,760
but your determination.

945
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,560
Tou.

946
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,870
Things need to be clear.

947
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,520
Once there is estrangement

948
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,040
between you two,

949
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,390
it will be difficult to repair it.

950
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,120
Tou.

951
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,470
Listen to me.

952
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,910
Even though father's birthday is over,

953
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,560
you can still bring her here.

954
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,890
Since we're both in Dongdu,

955
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,120
maybe we could meet her as a family.

956
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,120
Sister.

957
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,120
Xuezhi

958
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
has her temperament.

959
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,950
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

960
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,560
But don't worry about me.

961
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,610
If you go back to Xiangzhou,

962
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,840
I'll take Xuezhi to see you.

963
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,950
You've

964
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,800
always been stubborn.

965
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,630
I still have to be worried about you now.

966
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,840
I think

967
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,390
it's nice to have a sister

968
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,720
who’s worried about me.

969
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,120
Zheng.

970
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,360
Come.

971
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,630
Careful.

972
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,390
Here, Zheng.

973
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,190
Have some tea.

974
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,430
Thank you.

975
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:08,950
Zheng.

976
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,360
After talking to your brother,

977
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,520
why are you so glum?

978
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,870
Seeing Tou

979
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,670
so lonely all the time,

980
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,950
as his sister,

981
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,800
I don’t feel good.

982
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,390
A master of Shangguan family

983
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,070
doesn’t need to be worried about marriage.

984
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,190
Tou is very stubborn about marriage.

985
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,000
All these years, he's never liked anyone.

986
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,090
Now he finally found someone,

987
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,430
but his temper…

988
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,040
I’m really worried.

989
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,840
He found someone?

990
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,360
How come I don’t know?

991
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,800
Who is this lady?

992
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,520
Zheng.

993
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,190
Don’t you want to tell me?
