00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 21

4
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,830
Fengzi.

5
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,030
A girl only has one chance

6
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,720
for the life.

7
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,080
If you miss it,

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,030
you will regret it.

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,880
I’ll help you this time.

10
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,670
But you should move.

11
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Xuezhi.

12
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,470
I hope you can set your sights high.

13
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,000
You shouldn’t think of being married now.

14
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,079
Since your dad changed,

15
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
the relation between the Hall of Flames

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,320
and other sects has been really bad.

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,650
Several days ago, the flu spread virally.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,670
You wiped out Divine Spirit Temple,

19
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,550
helping the world get rid of a huge trouble.

20
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,910
It’s impressive.

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,750
I hope you

22
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
could take this chance to

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
reconcile with other sects.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,250
Having seen you become the Master of the Hall,

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,110
I feel

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,910
gratified.

27
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,600
Uncle Lin.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,880
If it hasn’t been Sword Manor’s help

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
for all these years,

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
we would have had more

31
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,470
enemies in the world.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,030
I

33
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,360
always want to express my gratitude to you.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
So, this is a chance for me.

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Good girl.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
You’ve grown up.

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,190
Uncle Lin.

38
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,800
I’ll go see Fengzi

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
and send my congratulations to her.

40
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,750
Go ahead.

41
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,470
You are ba…

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
Fengzi?

43
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,330
Congratulations.

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,920
Tou.

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,160
I have something to tell you.

46
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,500
Can I sit down and have a word with you?

47
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,950
Come on in.

48
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,550
Don’t close the door.

49
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,070
We haven’t met for a long time.

50
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,230
Let’s get hammered tonight.

51
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,480
Okay, good!

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Leader Lin.

53
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,000
Chief Guardian.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,880
Congratulations.

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,810
Long time no see.

56
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,790
Since the Hero Assembly,

57
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,520
I haven’t thanked you properly

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,230
for sending Qingmei back.

59
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,270
It’s my pleasure.

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,000
Right,

61
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,270
Xuezhi is here.

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,830
Did you see her?

63
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,790
She’s here?

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,460
She’s with Shangguan Tou.

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Miss.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Miss.

67
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,320
Miss.

68
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,800
-Miss Chong.
-Miss.

69
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,350
Leader Yuan.

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,010
Are you looking for Fengzi?

71
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,640
She’s not here.

72
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,970
I’ll take you to see her.

73
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,480
This way.

74
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,620
What are you trying to say?

75
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,480
Since the day you left Sword Manor,

76
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,950
I have been thinking of

77
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,200
the days we spent together.

78
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,600
We used to talk about everything.

79
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,590
We chanted poetry and painted pictures together.

80
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,410
We practiced martial arts together.

81
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,530
We played chess together.

82
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,150
And the first time we drank wine.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Enough.

84
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,390
Fengzi.

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,270
Don’t you think it’s not proper

86
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,510
to mention that now?

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I’m afraid if I don’t mention it now,

88
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,950
there’ll be no chance later.

89
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,200
Tou.

90
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,830
Can you forgive me?

91
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,159
If you think I hurt you,

92
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,840
I can make it up to you for the rest of my life.

93
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,390
It’s passed for a long time.

94
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,310
I don’t want to mention it again.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
And I don’t resent you.

96
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
So you needn’t be forgiven by me.

97
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,320
I do not need you compensation either.

98
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,110
But Tou…

99
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,640
Enough.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,760
Today you’ll be engaged with Mr. Xia.

101
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,480
It’s improper for you to be here.

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,159
Leave now.

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
No.

104
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,760
It’s not my intention

105
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
to marry him.

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
I thought I could forget about you.

107
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,970
But after seeing you today, I began to realize

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,780
you are always the only one

109
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,230
in my heart.

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,640
Fengzi.

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,740
No matter how many times you tell me that,

112
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,600
my reply wouldn’t change a bit.

113
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,950
I won’t accept you.

114
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Is it because of Xuezhi?

115
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,440
What do you like her for?

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,350
The rarely seen explicitness and sincerity in her.

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,070
I’ve decided to

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,510
spend this life with her.

119
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,640
Since you came to Sword Manor,

120
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,880
everyone has thought that

121
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,540
we are destined to be together

122
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,410
because we grew up together

123
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,160
and we are well matched.

124
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
She has a lot

125
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,070
on her shoulder.

126
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,270
She will become nothing but you burden.

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,720
Don’t you want

128
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,640
a free life?

129
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
Even if it was burden,

130
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,780
I would be happy to take it.

131
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,320
You wouldn’t understand

132
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,760
our relationship.

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,350
We grew up together,

134
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,440
and we had been together for nearly 10 years.

135
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,920
It’s still not as good as

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,760
those months with her?

137
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Tou.

138
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,760
The person in my heart

139
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,400
has always been you.

140
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,520
Stop.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Did you forget about

142
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
us sleeping together that night?

143
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,280
Lin Fengzi.

144
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
Miss. Chong.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,760
Xuezhi.

146
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,000
Miss. Chong.

147
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,440
Xuezhi.

148
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,320
Xuezhi.

149
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,450
Don’t touch me.

150
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,880
I heard it.

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,710
It’s not like what you heard.

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,230
It’s not like what you heard. Xuezhi.

153
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,910
Why don’t you dare to admit it?

154
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,760
You who raped Fengzi and that’s why they

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,030
deprived of your martial arts and expelled you.

156
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,640
Enough.

157
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,350
You smeared me once before.

158
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,440
Isn’t it enough?

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
Xuezhi.

160
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,840
Listen to me.

161
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,880
At that time,

162
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,400
I did drink,

163
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,030
but my mind was clear.

164
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,910
I did not do anything to Lin Fengzi.

165
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,840
Believe me.

166
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,760
Shangguan Tou.

167
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,470
You are such a hypocrite.

168
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,110
Is what she said true?

169
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,350
It’s not.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,960
At that night,

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,360
was it not you who was lying in Fengzi’s bed?

172
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,590
Bed?

173
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,230
This is inappropriate.

174
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
So,

175
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,280
this is your secret.

176
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,110
Xuezhi.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,880
I know that

178
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,550
whatever I say now is of no use.

179
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,320
So, please

180
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,880
don’t hold him back.

181
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,320
Don’t worry.

182
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,550
I’ll not hold him back.

183
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,000
And I’ll not see him anymore.

184
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,520
Xuezhi.

185
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
Xuezhi, listen to me.

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Believe me.

187
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,910
This is not true.

188
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,590
I did nothing. Believe me.

189
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,470
Master Shangguan.

190
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,470
You helped me and protected me.

191
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,110
I owe you a lot.

192
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,280
But this

193
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,760
is an end to everything.

194
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,110
From now on,

195
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
we’re clear.

196
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,550
Please let go of me.

197
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,790
Please hear me explain.

198
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,350
Xuezhi.

199
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,520
Master Shangguan.

200
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,120
If you don’t want others to know,

201
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,830
you should’ve never done it.

202
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,340
Since you did something shameful like this,

203
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,400
please leave Xuezhi alone.

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,910
This is between Xuezhi and me.

205
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,000
It’s none of your business.

206
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,640
Xuezhi.

207
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,440
Hear me out.

208
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,700
If you want to explain,

209
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,640
you should do that to Miss Lin

210
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,080
and the guests here.

211
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,080
Muyuan.

212
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
Let’s go.

213
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,790
Xuezhi.

214
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,470
Xuezhi.

215
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,200
Xuezhi.

216
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,140
Shangguan Tou.

217
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,230
What on earth are you thinking about?

218
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,520
Do you have to do this

219
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,880
in public?

220
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
I’m deeply sorry.

221
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,400
Please leave us alone.

222
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,150
Please.

223
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,670
Thank you. Please.

224
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,280
Let’s go.

225
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Let’s go.

226
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,200
I expelled you from Sword Manor.

227
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,840
You came to destroy my daughter’s big day.

228
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,440
Why do you hate me so much?

229
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
Leader Lin.

230
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,790
I said

231
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,640
I did nothing bad

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,640
to your daughter.

233
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,350
You should find out the truth

234
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,150
instead of blaming me directly.

235
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,550
You made Xuezhi misunderstand me today.

236
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
Why else do you want?

237
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,350
What else?

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,910
Shangguan Tou.

239
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,030
We used to be fellows.

240
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,880
So, I tolerated you again and again.

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,840
Don’t push your luck.

242
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,110
You have to pay the price today.

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,470
I’m talking to you.

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,030
Let go.

245
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,150
Qingmei.

246
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,840
Enough.

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Tou.

248
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,470
You should be ashamed.

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Leader?

250
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,180
Aren’t you at the Moon Valley?

251
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,550
Where’s Master Shangguan?

252
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,230
Zhusha.

253
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,550
-Master.
-Xuezhi.

254
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,230
What’s wrong?

255
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,840
Xuezhi.

256
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,200
You will get married soon.

257
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,910
You still can’t learn to be reserved.

258
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,960
It was a good day.

259
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,350
But you ruined it.

260
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,960
You are making me disgraced.

261
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,470
Master,

262
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,840
please forgive her.

263
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,200
It’s my fault.

264
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
It’s ridiculous.

265
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,440
Father,

266
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,760
I’ve decided to

267
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,590
cancel my engagement.

268
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,960
I can’t marry Qingmei.

269
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,030
Fengzi,

270
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
calm down.

271
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,400
Did I do something wrong?

272
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
No.

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,150
I was wrong.

274
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,520
Ridiculous.

275
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,460
How long are you going to be like this?

276
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,120
Do you want to humiliate the whole Sword Manor?

277
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,710
Father,

278
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,790
I’m sorry.

279
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,400
Shuangshuang,

280
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,040
you did not let me down.

281
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,560
Of course

282
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,080
I would accomplish what you asked for.

283
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,880
Chong Xuezhi has lost her wits now.

284
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,190
It’s the best time to take action.

285
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,520
I can finally carry out my plan.

286
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,430
Plan?

287
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,070
You have another one?

288
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,070
This is just the beginning.

289
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Assassin!

290
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
Kill them.

291
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,000
Retreat.

292
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,310
Stop now.

293
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,110
Mind the trap.

294
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,920
Liuli.

295
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,040
How is she?

296
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,560
She had a fever all night.

297
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,840
She kept murmuring and crying in dream.

298
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,710
Liuli.

299
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,610
You are a medicine expert. Write a prescription.

300
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,760
I did whatever I could.

301
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,560
She’s ill inside.

302
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,430
There’s no way to cure that.

303
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,160
So we can’t do anything?

304
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,580
What is Chief Guardian doing?

305
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
He

306
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,520
has been taking care of the Leader for a whole night.

307
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,710
Feeding the medicine and cleaning her sweat.

308
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,590
She is still asleep.

309
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,280
Elder Yuwen is still angry.

310
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,160
Even if she woke up,

311
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,880
I’m worried that she would suffer more.

312
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,280
If she wakes up,

313
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,190
pretend that she hasn’t.

314
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,230
You are awake?

315
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,760
You’re fine.

316
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,220
You’re just a little weak.

317
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,410
Have some porridge.

318
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,350
It’s a bit cold.

319
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,060
I’ll heat it up for you.

320
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,430
I’m fine.

321
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,800
Be careful.

322
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,350
Muyuan.

323
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,160
What should I do?

324
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,680
How could this be?

325
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,370
Stop thinking about it.

326
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,800
This is not your fault.

327
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,190
Muyuan.

328
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,470
I’m useless, right?

329
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,760
I…

330
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,470
It’s over.

331
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
No matter how much

332
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,400
you were hurt outside the Hall,

333
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,960
it’s good that you could return safely.

334
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,190
Because

335
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,000
this is your home.

336
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,190
As long as you’re home,

337
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,430
everything

338
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,110
will be alright.

339
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,680
Moreover,

340
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,190
I’m here.

341
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,640
I’ll do my best

342
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,190
to protect you.

343
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,830
I’m sorry.

344
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
Take care of yourself first,

345
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:13,760
ok?

346
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,920
Chief Guardian, warm water needs replacement.

347
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,520
Come in.

348
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,190
Leader.

349
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,830
Leader.

350
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
You woke up.

351
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,890
I thought you wouldn’t wake up.

From the square to the gate,

it has 24 disciples in three shifts.

From the main hall to the backyard,

Although it is heavily guarded,

and its disciples act strictly according to the order,

440

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,600
in the Hall

527
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,949
wants to marry you either.

528
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,230
You did such despicable things

529
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,630
and wanted to be forgiven by her.

530
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,679
Do you think it’s possible?

531
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,760
There’s always an excuse to condemn someone.

532
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,770
I can’t control what you think.

533
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,320
It’s my freedom

534
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
to do whatever I want.

535
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,430
Yeah, indeed.

536
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,290
I had no right to interfere with your actions.

537
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,080
But I have to warn you

538
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,960
if you keep being dissolute

539
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
like this,

540
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,910
you will never make her happy.

541
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,200
Please behave yourself.

542
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,800
Fengzi.

543
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,360
Cheer up.

544
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,710
You don’t want to listen to me?

545
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,040
Come on, get up.

546
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
Let’s have a talk.

547
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,320
Even if you stay sad like this,

548
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,870
the person in your mind

549
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,260
would have no idea about this.

550
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,670
You didn’t eat anything these days.

551
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,280
But where is he?

552
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,630
No, master.

553
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,760
It’s my bad.

554
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,000
Tou was still holding the grudge for

555
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,400
what happened that year,

556
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,780
and he stayed far away from me.

557
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,760
But these were not his faults.

558
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,910
Don’t make excuses for him anymore.

559
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,520
Master.

560
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,350
I thought it through.

561
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,430
I want to tell the truth to my father.

562
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,840
So he wouldn’t complain him anymore.

563
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,950
Perhaps he would agree to our marriage.

564
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,910
You can’t.

565
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,520
What’s wrong?

566
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,120
Fengzi.

567
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Listen to me.

568
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,840
You can’t tell your father this impulsively.

569
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,230
Think about it.

570
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,320
If you tell him

571
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,720
it was all because of you,

572
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
how would he think about you?

573
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,150
Sword Manor is the top sect in the world now.

574
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,560
You’re a lady of the manor.

575
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,710
But you seduced a disciple

576
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,970
and lied on bed not properly dressed.

577
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,520
If your father knew this,

578
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,630
wouldn’t he be outraged?

579
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,230
He might have some random guy marry you

580
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,950
to maintain the reputation of the Manor.

581
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,000
Maybe,

582
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,760
he would send people to Shangguan Tou

583
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,840
and kill him.

584
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,230
I haven’t thought about this, master.

585
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,120
So, Fengzi,

586
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,150
you shouldn’t make any action impulsively.

587
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:29,950
Before thinking of the following move

588
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,470
well enough,

589
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,550
you shouldn’t tell your father about this.

590
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,330
Do you get it?

591
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,950
Excellent.

592
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,320
Sir.

593
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,600
You’ve progressed a lot

these days.

595
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,800
I’m satisfied that

596
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,160
you’re devoted in practicing.

597
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,900
I’ve decided to

598
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,120
focus on practicing

599
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,870
instead of being distracted by other things.

600
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,520
Great.

601
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,430
If you keep doing this,

602
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,890
you’ll achieve a lot

603
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,470

Who’s that?

610
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,230
He did not show his identity.

611
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,470
But judging from what he wears,

612
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,670
he looks like someone

613
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,800
from the government.

How about

eating something?

619
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,720
You haven’t eaten for a day.

620
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
You can eat first.

you can directly go inside and see her.

625
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,360
Why do you wait for her like this?

626
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,800

He has been waiting for you for a whole day.

he must see you today.

The Chief Guardian has already declined him.

He doesn’t want to leave.

639

What clue?

658

Look at this sword.

659
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,880
This is a normal sword, isn’t it?

But later

663
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,000
I found that

this is from our Hall.

But

678
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,430
it will cost us a little time to do that

679

because there are so many records.

680
