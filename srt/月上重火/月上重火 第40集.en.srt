00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 40

4
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Where are you, Tou?

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Tou.

6
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,400
Tou, where are you?

7
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
Tou,

8
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,079
where on earth are you?

9
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,640
You told me

10
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
you’d come back

11
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,800
in three days.

12
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
And now

13
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,800
it’s been three days,

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,920
but where are you?

15
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
Tou,

16
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,200
can’t you find your way back?

17
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
It’s OK.

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,040
I’m here.

19
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,600
I’ll take you home.

20
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,920
Master,

21
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,500
Fengzi asked the cook
to prepare some porridge for you.

22
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,250
Please have it before it gets cold.

23
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
Out.

24
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,459
I don’t want to see you.

25
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Master,

26
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,200
you can scold me,

27
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,250
beat me or do whatever you want.

28
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,880
But please take care of yourself.

29
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,720
What should Sword Manor do if you fall ill?

30
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,880
What should Sword Manor do?

31
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
How dare you ask me this question?

32
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,409
Like you’ve ever cared about Sword Manor.

33
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,960
If you do care about me and Sword Manor,

34
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120
you’d not have done such monstrous

35
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,180
things to bring shame on Sword Manor!

36
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,680
And now you ask me what should Sword Manor do?

37
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
You are right, master.

38
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,480
It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.

39
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
I did those things

40
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
because I wanted to bring honor to the sect.

41
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,360
Shut up!

42
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,340
You’re still using sophistry against me

43
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,080
at a time like this?

44
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,760
You are right.

45
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,180
Sorry, master.

46
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,720
It’s my fault.

47
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,530
It’s not your fault.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
It’s never your fault.

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,520
It’s my fault.

50
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,960
I have misjudged you.

51
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,400
You were very ambitious

52
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,300
and aggressive when you were a child.

53
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,840
But I thought you were just being childish

54
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,120
to be competitive.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,800
I thought if I educated you well,

56
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,720
you’d not be like that

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,320
when you grow up.

58
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
As it turned out,

59
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,580
you are indeed nothing like that now,

60
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,300
but instead of becoming more mature,

61
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
you’ve become more sophisticated.

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,680
You practiced the Nine Moves secretly,

63
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,680
yet you are not guilty at all.

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
People won’t criticize you

65
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,600
but will accuse the Sword Manor

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,280
of cultivating such a filthy disciple!

67
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,300
Whoever speaks ill of Sword Manor

68
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,010
will be killed by me!

69
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,890
You monster!

70
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,730
Have you not killed enough people?

71
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,680
You crave for glory success
and seek for victory.

72
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,980
If I don’t discipline you now,

73
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,640
you’ll be a threat to the world!

74
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,060
I crave for glory success?

75
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,120
I seek for victory?

76
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
Master,

77
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,170
you act to be righteous
but you’re in fact lost in vanity!

78
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,960
What did you say?

79
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,090
Am I wrong about you?

80
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
You weren’t subject to Lord Lu

81
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
to protect me, were you?

82
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,840
You did so only for the reputation
of Sword Manor

83
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,100
and your own prestige.

84
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,260
You are not mad at me
because I’ve done wrong things,

85
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,880
but because I’ve brought shame on you.

86
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
Throughout these years,

87
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
you’ve been cherishing your fame,

88
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,840
claiming to win people by virtue,

89
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,770
and standing aloof from the world.

90
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,300
You didn’t participate in the Hero Assembly

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
because you wanted people to think that

92
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,920
you were a noble man of virtues and integrity.

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,640
But did it work?

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,760
You spoke for the Hall of Flames

95
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
so that they lived in peace for five years.

96
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
Then everyone believes that we are

97
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,840
on Chong Xuezhi’s side.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,880
You won’t be able to keep yourself out
from them however hard you try.

99
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,440
Some people may even think

100
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
you have already learned

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,320
the Nine Moves

102
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,520
as it was kept in Sword Manor for 5 years!

103
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
Say that again!

104
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
-Father, stop!
-I…

105
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Father.

106
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,150
Father.

107
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
Qingmei is just being emotional.

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
Don’t be mad, father.

109
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,440
Father,

110
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,880
no matter what he’s done wrong,

111
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,549
he’s still your disciple

112
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,030
and my husband.

113
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,810
If you don’t care about the time
you spent on him,

114
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
then please think about me.

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,010
Would you please stop blaming him?

116
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Qingmei,

117
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,760
say something.

118
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,160
Apologize to my father.

119
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
Say something!

120
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,610
Throughout my life,

121
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
the biggest mistake I’ve made

122
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,880
is to let you marry him!

123
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,680
No.

124
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,560
That’s not true, father.

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,040
Qingmei,

126
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,970
apologize to my father.

127
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,720
Please, I’m begging you.

128
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Say sorry!

129
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,480
Very well.

130
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,160
You still don’t

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
feel sorry after all this time.

132
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,960
You are too big a figure

133
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,960
to stay in the Sword Manor!

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
Master,

135
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
are you expelling me?

136
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,680
Father.

137
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,960
Father.

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
You can’t expel him.

139
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
What should I do if he’s not here?

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,280
Father.

141
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,480
I’m begging you. I’m begging you.

142
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
-Don’t expel him!
-Stop it, Fengzi!

143
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
You don’t need to beg him.

144
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,440
The Sword Manor will no longer

145
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,760
be my place to stay anyway!

146
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,240
You are mad at me

147
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,730
because after I master the Nine Moves,

148
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,500
you won’t be able to control me

149
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
and I will surpass you.

150
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,650
You don’t want me

151
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,050
to become the best in the world.

152
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,640
Very well.

153
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,200
Very well.

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
This is how you think of me?

155
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,560
I am speechless.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,680
From today on,

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,440
you are no longer

158
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,050
the Chief Disciple of the Sword Manor!

159
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
Get out!

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Out!

161
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Qingmei! Qingmei!

162
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Father,

163
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,520
he’s my husband.

164
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,240
How could you expel him?

165
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,280
You don’t need

166
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,210
a husband like that.

167
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
If so,

168
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
please forgive me for being unfilial

169
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,360
as I will go with my husband.

170
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,320
Fengzi!

171
00:12:41,860 --> 00:13:03,940
[Sword Manor]

172
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,720
Fengzi,

173
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,960
I have already got a plan.

174
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,930
After arriving in a place near Dongdu,

175
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
we can rent a house in the village

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,130
for temporary stay.

177
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,880
I have some money

178
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,490
that will cover our expense for some time.

179
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,160
Then

180
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,410
I will look for a governmental job.

181
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
With my ability,

182
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
I will be successful when time comes.

183
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,410
Don’t worry.

184
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,360
You will lead a better life with me

185
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,880
than when you were at the Sword Manor.

186
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,360
Qingmei,

187
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,820
I don’t need you to be successful.

188
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,720
All I want is a peaceful life.

189
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Nonsense.

190
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,560
I won’t let you live a difficult life.

191
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Let’s go.

192
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,120
Uncle,

193
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
you know I will be sad

194
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,000
to see this place.

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,880
Why did you bring me here?

196
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
This is your home.

197
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,920
Where else should you go?

198
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,380
The Hall of Flames was my home.

199
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
But it’s gone now,

200
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,480
so is

201
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,680
the man who loved me

202
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,620
as if he was my brother.

203
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
Xuezhi.

204
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,740
Don’t waste your time shedding tears
for Yuwen Muyuan.

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,520
You are not homeless

206
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,820
even if the Hall of Flames is gone.

207
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,320
Let me ask you.

208
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,000
Is Tou a family to you?

209
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
Of course.

210
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,480
This is Tou’s home.

211
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,040
So it’s your home too.

212
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,080
From now on,

213
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,760
you’ll just stay at home, have a good rest

214
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
and think about nothing.

215
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,600
But this place

216
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
is full of my memory with Tou.

217
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
The flowers,

218
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
the plants,

219
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,880
the grass

220
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,080
and the trees…

221
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,900
Everything reminds me of him.

222
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
How can I not think of him?

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,160
I also feel painful that Tou is gone.

224
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
But now

225
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,960
even Wuming is missing.

226
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Xuezhi,

227
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,500
I can’t afford to worry about you too.

228
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,920
You mean Wuming is missing?

229
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
But the other day he…

230
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,600
On that day, I received a letter from Ms. Qiu.

231
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,330
She asked Wuming to leave first

232
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,480
to help Tou.

233
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,880
Then I went to the Winehouse of Fairyland
to see you.

234
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,160
But when I arrived there,

235
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,240
I found that you had left to find Tou.

236
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,240
So I left to look for you.

237
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,120
Now I feel guilty that

238
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,600
I didn’t stay with Wuming.

239
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
If I was there,

240
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,420
Tou would not have…

241
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Xuezhi,

242
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,560
cheer up.

243
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,800
Tou won’t rest assured

244
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,950
if he sees that you’re upset.

245
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,440
But he will never see me.

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,589
Never.

247
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,960
He has passed away.

248
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,530
I understand your pain,

249
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,310
but you’ve still got a long way to go.

250
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
You should learn to be tough

251
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,420
no matter what happens to you.

252
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Uncle,

253
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,720
I want to have a walk alone.

254
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,200
I want to be there with you for the rest

255
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,040
of your life.

256
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,720
I don’t have much to offer,

257
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
but I am yours

258
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
if you say yes.

259
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,160
Xuezhi.

260
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,000
Xuezhi.

261
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Xuezhi.

262
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,760
Xuezhi.

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,640
Xuezhi.

264
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,980
Master Shangguan,

265
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,880
you’re awake.

266
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,280
Wuming,

267
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
did you hear any sound?

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Sound?

269
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,560
No.

270
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,050
Impossible.

271
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,180
That was Xuezhi playing the instrument.

272
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,760
Xuezhi.

273
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,280
Xuezhi.

274
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,530
How’s Xuezhi doing now?

275
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,520
Don’t worry, Master Shangguan.

276
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,680
She is fine.

277
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
I saw that Mr. Lin came to rescue.

278
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
She is safe with Mr. Lin there.

279
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,340
Master Shangguan.

280
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
Master Shangguan,

281
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,140
you’re finally awake.

282
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,380
Your Highness.

283
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Please lie down.

284
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Lie down.

285
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,040
You scared me to death.

286
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
Luckily you were not stabbed

287
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,960
in the vital part.

288
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,680
Otherwise

289
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
even the greatest doctor in the world

290
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,680
won’t be able to save you.

291
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,810
Thank you, Your Highness, for saving my life.

292
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,280
I feel shame

293
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
when hearing this.

294
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
I didn’t expect that

295
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,770
my brother would do such an outrageous thing.

296
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,640
I am also to blame.

297
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,520
I was impulsive

298
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,810
to fall into Lord Lu’s trap.

299
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,920
At that time,

300
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,010
Lord Lu announced to kill me
in front of the Imperial Guards.

301
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,160
Seems like

302
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,090
the man named Shangguan Tou

303
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,120
can’t live on.

304
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
I feel

305
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
guilty about you,

306
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,040
about your sister,

307
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,920
and, more importantly, about your father.

308
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,820
My brother has done something wrong,

309
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,580
and as his eldest brother,

310
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,760
I can hardly absolve myself from the blame.

311
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,170
I will share the consequence with him.

312
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,690
Share the consequence?

313
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,060
Your Highness,

314
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,130
Lord Lu doesn’t feel guilty at all.

315
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,100
How will you share the consequence with him?

316
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
After all these,

317
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,320
you still think he’s just being childish

318
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,240
and thus try to cover up for him?

319
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,040
But he’s my brother after all.

320
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,000
Your Highness,

321
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,810
this is not my malicious speculation,

322
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,240
but

323
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,640
if you keep indulging Lord Lu,

324
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,930
his ambition will grow.

325
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,740
Then I’m afraid

326
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
he will have to stew in his own juice.

327
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,040
Your Highness,

328
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,780
please make up your mind quickly.

329
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,520
You think that

330
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,320
he has a hidden agenda

331
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,370
behind the establishment of the Sects Alliance?

332
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,880
I’m not sure yet

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,720
about his real purpose.

334
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,160
However,

335
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
I would love to find out the truth

336
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,800
for Your Highness.

337
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,000
Mr. Xia.

338
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,560
Lord Lu.

339
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,010
More haste, less speed.

340
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,040
Mr. Xia

341
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,680
still doesn’t seem to

342
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,700
grasp the essence of this saying.

343
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,720
Can we talk in a private place?

344
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,860
Your Highness,

345
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,920
what do you want from me

346
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,480
by coming to the wild?

347
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,680
Mr. Xia.

348
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
I always admire

349
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,480
excellent martial artists.

350
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,780
And your master, Lin Zongxing
happens to be my fifth uncle.

351
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,040
So we are on the same side.

352
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
I’m always honest and kind to people

353
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,480
that I appreciate.

354
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,880
In history, Liu Bei sent invitation
to Zhuge Liang many times.

355
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I came to this remote place today

356
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,640
to meet you

357
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,280
because I want you

358
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
to work for me.

359
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
I am flattered.

360
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,410
I am nobody but a plain martial artist.

361
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,220
Your Highness is far out of my league.

362
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,920
Were you just practicing

363
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,680
the Nine Moves?

364
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,560
Judging from what I saw,

365
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,840
you are stuck in

366
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
some choke point, right?

367
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,680
Your Highness doesn’t need to waste your time

368
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
on an ordinary man.

369
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Mr. Xia,

370
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,000
if you work for me,

371
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,560
I will not only reward you
with unimaginable wealth and glory,

372
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,680
but also help you

373
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,920
reach the top state of the Nine Moves.

374
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,040
That is, the ninth move

375
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,280
of this invincible martial arts skill.

376
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,210
What do you think

377
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,440
about this deal?

378
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,540
Thank you for your offer, Your Highness.

379
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,120
I don’t care about

380
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
wealth and glory.

381
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,920
As for the Nine Moves,

382
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,820
I will figure a way out myself.

383
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,040
The government has not been friends
with the martial arts world.

384
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,300
Please give up and leave, Your Highness.

385
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,260
Your Highness,

386
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
do you need me to…

387
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
No.

388
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,080
Even foes will become friends someday.

389
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,800
He will come to me for help.

390
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,740
What are you doing?

391
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,560
Fengzi.

392
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
Thank you for your hard work.

393
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,440
That’s nothing.

394
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,320
These are my responsibilities anyway.

395
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,640
I feel happy

396
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,760
as a clam now.

397
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,560
You’re like a kid.

398
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,800
Go wash your hands. Lunch is ready.

399
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,360
OK.

400
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,400
Fengzi.

401
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,680
What’s wrong?

402
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
You’re not feeling well?

403
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,240
I’m fine.

404
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,520
I’m just not yet used to the new life.

405
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,920
I am sorry

406
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,520
that you have to suffer the toil.

407
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,880
Do tell me if you’re not feeling well.

408
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,080
Don’t keep it from me.

409
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,930
Otherwise I’ll be worried.

410
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,120
I think

411
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,480
you should see a doctor

412
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
and get a prescription.

413
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,520
Doctor,

414
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,480
how’s my wife doing?

415
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
Is she ill?

416
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Don’t worry.

417
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
She’s a bit wore out,
and was exposed to wind chill.

418
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,970
She’s caught a cold.

419
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,760
I’m writing you a prescription.

420
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,360
OK, thank you.

421
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,040
Prepare decoction according to the prescription

422
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,680
and take it every morning and night

423
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,000
for ten consecutive days.

424
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
She will recover then.

425
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,240
Also,

426
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,760
it’s getting cold these days.

427
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,320
Don’t expose yourself to the wind.

428
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
OK, I know.

429
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,000
OK.

430
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,920
I’ll say goodbye then.

431
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,880
Allow me to see you off.

432
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,940
Thank you, doctor.

433
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,040
Here. Thank you.

434
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
OK. Thank you.

435
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,120
Thank you.

436
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,240
Well,

437
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,300
we have the prescription now.

438
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,010
You don’t need to worry.

439
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,660
From now on,

440
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,640
don’t do the laboring

441
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,760
and dirty work.

442
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,760
Leave it to me.

443
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Your priority now is to nurse yourself
back to health.

444
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,840
Tell me

445
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,320
what I should do now.

446
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,200
Is there any dirt or mess

447
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,240
waiting for me?

448
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,160
Well,

449
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,120
go fetch me some water.

450
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,600
OK. Just a sec.

451
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,160
What can I do for you, Your Highness?

452
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,090
Chief Guardian,

453
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,240
how are you feeling now?

454
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,720
Much better.

455
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,160
Thank you for asking.

456
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,960
Good.

457
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,440
I have moved the disciples of the Hall of Flames

458
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,840
to a safe place.

459
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
When you recover,

460
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,000
we can start resuming the Hall of Flames.

461
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

462
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
In fact,

463
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,760
I should thank you.

464
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,640
You killed Shangguan Tou for me.

465
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,560
That soothes my nerves.

466
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,920
You are welcome, Your Highness.

467
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,080
Shangguan Tou deserved it.

468
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,440
After days of indoor recuperation,

469
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,120
you must be bored.

470
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,720
Why don’t you take a walk on such a sunny day?

471
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,520
A friend of mine moved
to the neighborhood lately.

472
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,440
Maybe you can visit him for me.

473
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
But this friend of mine

474
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,080
is not sensible.

475
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,600
He’s quite stubborn.

476
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,400
Please go and enlighten him.

477
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,890
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,800
Then, who is this friend

479
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,380
you are talking about?

480
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,480
Xia Qingmei.

481
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Miss Chong,

482
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,200
if you keep being depressed every day,

483
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,080
however hard I try to cure you,

484
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,760
you’ll develop some kind of disease

485
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,440
anyway.

486
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,480
Thank you for the reminder.

487
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,960
I’ve been troubling you a lot

488
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,360
these days.

489
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,660
You’re welcome, Miss.

490
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,050
I belong to the Moon Valley.

491
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,400
It’s my duty to take care of you.

492
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,360
I know

493
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,200
you take care of me tenderly

494
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,880
because of Tou.

495
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,480
You should live a good life, Miss Chong.

496
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,560
That will be the best way

497
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,320
to pay back Master Shangguan’s care for you.

498
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,600
I will live a good life for myself,

499
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,880
and for him, too.

500
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,920
Miss Chong,

501
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,000
I know you care for Master Shangguan very much.

502
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,320
But revenge

503
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
is just like medical treatment.

504
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,680
You need to be 100% confident

505
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,840
before you take actions.

506
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,810
Lord Lu is an important figure.

507
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,570
He is the second son of His Majesty.

508
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,060
Ordinary people have no chance to approach him.

509
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,680
I won’t act rashly

510
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
without 100% of confidence.

511
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,600
Sugar-coated haws!

512
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,960
Have a look.

513
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,940
[Zhang’s Pharmacy]

514
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,640
Mister,

515
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,530
please get ten doses of the herbs
on the prescription for me.

516
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,720
Ten doses?

517
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,480
Right.

518
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Just a minute.

519
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Sir,

520
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,880
that will be 70 coppers.

521
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,120
70 coppers?

522
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,440
Mister,

523
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,400
I don’t have enough…

524
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,840
What can I do for you, Muyuan?

525
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,200
Thanks to your help,

526
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,160
the disciples of the Hall of Flames
were not reduced to refugees.

527
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,600
I want to express my gratitude

528
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,400
with a toast using this cup of tea.

529
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,630
That was my master…

530
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,760
Mr. Lin’s idea.

531
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,139
He’s a benevolent man.

532
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,090
And that was just a small deed of kindness.

533
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,230
Mr. Lin

534
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,850
has developed the Sword Manor

535
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,440
into a great sect.

536
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,610
I don’t think benevolence

537
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,210
is the only secret.

538
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,760
You can just get to the point.

539
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,190
If you’re here to persuade the Sword Manor
to work for Lord Lu,

540
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,120
then you will be wasting your time.

541
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,260
I have fallen out with Mr. Lin.

542
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,460
I won’t be able to help you.

543
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,300
You are right, Mr. Xia.

544
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,760
His Highness does want
to solicit martial artists.

545
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,580
But in the Sword Manor, the one he values most

546
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
is not Mr. Lin,

547
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,040
but you.

548
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,440
Me?

549
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,680
What do I have

550
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,610
to get the attention of Lord Lu?

551
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,760
You are intelligent enough.

552
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,480
I believe

553
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,170
you will understand

554
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,200
the reason behind this.

555
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
A man

556
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,280
needs to go through ups and downs

557
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,880
before he can grow up.

558
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
People don’t care where a hero comes from.

559
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
If you ask me,

560
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,760
I’ll say what you need to ponder

561
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,360
is your future path.

562
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,560
Muyuan?

563
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
Take the money

564
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,260
and buy some health tonics for your wife.

565
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,490
However difficult life is,

566
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,360
don’t let your woman suffer.

567
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,640
You!

568
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Uncle,

569
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,320
the Herbal Medicine Master must have told you.

570
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,040
I won’t let Tou die in vain.

571
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,720
But you will be in grave danger.

572
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
You won’t be able to revenge for Tou,

573
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,540
and worse, you’ll lose your life.

574
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,760
I don’t care about my life.

575
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,760
But I care.

576
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,680
And your father cared even more.

577
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,400
Do you have any idea
who you are fighting against?

578
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,060
The second son of the emperor.

579
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,560
Do you have a plan?

580
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,960
Without a thorough plan,

581
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,890
what you are doing is pure suicide.

582
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,560
I don’t agree.

583
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,650
You can’t just go like this.

584
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,540
How about this?

585
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,620
As the saying goes,

586
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,240
“It is never too late for a gentleman
to avenge himself.”

587
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,570
Take my advice. Don’t rush into anything.

588
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,640
Improve your martial arts in a private place.

589
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,500
You need to master the Nine Moves.

590
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,600
This art is a result from toil by your father.

591
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,880
Everyone fears it.

592
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
You’ve come to the sixth move.

593
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,200
When you master the ninth

594
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,600
and become invincible,

595
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,980
I won’t stop you

596
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,240
from revenge then.

597
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,570
That's the deal.

598
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,010
Improve your martial arts from now on.

599
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,120
Uncle,

600
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,240
don’t worry.

601
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,580
How can I not worry?

602
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,400
I have lost Tou.

603
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,060
I can’t afford to lose you too.

604
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,400
Uncle,

605
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,200
calm down.

606
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,240
Listen to me.

607
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,170
It’s not that I don’t want
to learn the Nine Moves.

608
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,920
It’s that we have no time left.

609
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,520
After Tou was gone,

610
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,440
people started to fear Xue Lie even more.

611
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,440
The small sects have no choice
but to listen to his command.

612
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,440
And the bigger sects dare not
to speak out their anger.

613
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,000
If I don’t find a way to stop him

614
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,960
from manipulating and tormenting
the martial artists,

615
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,120
there will be a catastrophe in the world.

616
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,120
I understand.

617
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,420
But I don’t want you to risk your life.

618
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,080
I want to stop Xue Lie

619
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,290
not only because I want to revenge for Tou,

620
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,000
but also because I uphold the morality
of the martial arts world.

621
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,340
My father always told me
about justice and righteousness.

622
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,560
That whoever practice martial arts

623
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,760
should not only care about themselves.

624
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,810
I didn’t get him when I was a kid.

625
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,600
But as I grow up,

626
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,120
I came to realize that

627
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,900
a tree by itself is just a tree,

628
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
but many trees form a forest.

629
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,880
The martial arts world is not about one person.

630
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,280
It’s about everyone.

631
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,080
My father didn’t choose
to make that terrible mistake.

632
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,040
If he had a choice

633
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,760
he would definitely want

634
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,160
someone to stop him at that time.

635
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,400
So, if I can stop this impending catastrophe,

636
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,840
then my father’s debt

637
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
will be somehow paid off.

638
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,040
I know

639
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
there’s nothing I can do to stop you.

640
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,440
But for now,

641
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,450
you need to nurse yourself.

642
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,680
Only when you are in good health

643
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,340
can you fight against Lord Lu.

644
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,080
Otherwise

645
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,780
you’ll be kicking against the pricks alone.

646
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,680
I don’t care about being alone.

647
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,930
I don’t care about fighting
against the whole world.

648
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,480
As long as I have faith,

649
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,520
I will forge ahead

650
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,920
even if there will be thousands of enemies.

651
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,440
Let’s drop this subject now.

652
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,680
Right,

653
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,640
if you have time,

654
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,200
write to Ms. Qiu.

655
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,880
She’s been worrying about you,

656
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,410
and inquiring me about you.

657
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,200
Then I’ll go to the Winehouse of Fairyland

658
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,530
to visit Hongxiu first.

659
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,500
Master Shangguan…

660
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,520
Mr. Yu.

661
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,360
Be careful along the way.

662
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,920
Send me a letter

663
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,320
if you need anything.

664
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

665
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,680
This time,

666
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,730
I will find out Lord Lu’s hidden agenda

667
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,130
and stop him from further mistake.

668
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,200
First,

669
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,140
this is me paying back your kindness.

670
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,880
Second,

671
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,770
this is about bringing peace back
to the martial arts world.

672
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,360
Third…

673
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,280
Third,

674
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,100
this is about resting my father
and sister’s souls.

675
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,860
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

676
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,640
Lord Lu,

677
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,920
I am sorry but

678
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,880
I don’t understand what about Xia Qingmei

679
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,640
that Your Highness values.

680
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,480
Indeed, Xia Qingmei

681
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,760
is nothing compared with you.

682
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
But if we want to establish the Sects Alliance,

683
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,160
we will need to take in

684
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,560
people like him.

685
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,600
If we want the alliance to work,

686
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,000
we need tigers like you,

687
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,400
and dogs like Xia Qingmei

688
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,800
and Feng Mo.

689
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,160
What’s more,

690
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,840
Xia Qingmei has something

691
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,800
I’ve always wanted

692
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,680
Enough.

693
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,580
I should stop here.

694
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,690
It’s been a long day for you.

695
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,610
Why don’t you

696
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,460
go back earlier to have a rest?

697
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,500
Your Highness,

698
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,560
why don’t you tell Yuwen Muyuan

699
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,420
that Xia Qingmei is secretly keeping
the Nine Moves

700
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,620
so that he can get it back from Xia?

701
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,920
Doesn’t it make it easier

702
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,040
for Your Highness?

703
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,920
When two tigers fight,

704
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,640
one of them will be severely injured.

705
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,200
It’s OK if they fight.

706
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,200
All I want is the Nine Moves.

707
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,720
When I get the manual in hand,

708
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,800
I’ll let them fight

709
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,760
as they want.

710
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,140
I went out to get you some herbs today.

711
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
The doctor said

712
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,560
you need to take this decoction consecutively.

713
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,320
So I bought ten doses,

714
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,140
plus some sweetmeats.

715
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,520
I know you don’t like bitterness.

716
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,650
Eat some sweetmeats

717
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,040
after taking the decoction,

718
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
then the bitterness will disappear.
