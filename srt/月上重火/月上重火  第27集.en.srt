2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 27

4
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,360
He found someone?

5
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,880
How come I don’t know?

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,320
Who is this lady?

7
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,030
Zheng.

8
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,720
Don’t you want to tell me?

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,660
It’s Chong Xuezhi.

10
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,670
Ms. Chong.

11
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,160
Leader Chong Xuezhi of the Hall of Flames?

12
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,720
Well.

13
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,829
Peaceful Moon Valley

14
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,630
and high profile Hall of Flames.

15
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,829
I think they're a good match.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,110
Yes.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,829
I like Ms. Chong.

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,550
I can't bear to see them fight like this.

19
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,010
I even want to explain it to Ms. Chong myself.

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,390
But Tou won't let me.

21
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,440
You know the temperament of Tou.

22
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,960
Is he a man who explains himself?

23
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,630
Zheng.

24
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,360
You have followed me to Xiangzhou for years

25
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,720
and you haven't been home.

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,360
You haven't seen your family in a while.

27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,490
This time back home,

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,190
as his sister,

29
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,080
if you don’t deal with this,

30
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,190
and

31
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,390
Imperial Advisor is busy with politics,

32
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,390
when will Tou be able to

33
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,050
settle his personal affairs?

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,220
How about this?

35
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,160
Why don't you go ahead

36
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,829
and invite Ms. Chong

37
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,829
to Dongdu?

38
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,470
We're his sister and brother-in-law.

39
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,470
We mediate for them.

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,829
After they are back together,

41
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,630
Tou

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,670
can take

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,530
Ms. Chong to my father-in-law.

44
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,440
We can go back to Xiangzhou without worries.

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,160
Wouldn't it be better for all of us?

46
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,670
But we keep it from Tou,

47
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,960
what if…

48
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,960
Zheng.

49
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,960
In my father-in-law's eyes,

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
as well as yours and mine,

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,440
isn't Tou

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,130
the child we've always had to take care of?

53
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,440
Right?

54
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,360
Fine.

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,790
Then I'll write to Ms. Chong.

56
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,530
Alright, darling.

57
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,800
What are you doing back?

58
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,470
I've been back for two days.

59
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,190
When I found out you went the Hall of Flames,

60
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,390
I followed you there.

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,130
You went to the Hall of Flames?

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,130
Why didn't you show yourself?

63
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,390
I was being followed.

64
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,670
It's just

65
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,440
a pawn of Lord Lu.

66
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,870
Not much of a fighter.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,950
It's probably

68
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,070
a stakeout.

69
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,670
Did Lord Lu

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,050
give you a hard time?

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,720
No.

72
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,920
He just said some half-baked words

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,070
during the game.

74
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,440
Nothing new.

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,390
Right.

76
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,790
How'd it go with Feng She?

77
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,550
You were right.

78
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
Feng She

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,950
is Feng Cheng's son.

80
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,950
Wuming.

81
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,720
I want you to go back to Huashan

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,950
and keep an eye on the Huashan Sect.

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,350
Whatever happens,

84
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,230
without my letter,

85
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,760
don't leave Huashan!

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,670
Yes!

87
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,670
-We want to see Lord Lu!
-We want to see Lord Lu!

88
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,950
We want to see Lord Lu!

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,440
My Lord.

90
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,670
What's going on?

91
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,390
My Lord.

92
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,450
These five people claim to be members

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,390
of Sanying Sect and under the guise of goodness,

94
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,110
they clashed with another sect

95
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,070
and killed two.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,760
Then they're guilty of murder.

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,480
Why bring them here?

98
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,000
My apology.

99
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,270
Since it happened in front of your mansion,

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,480
we’re afraid it may disturb you,

101
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,160
so

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,620
we came here to apologize.

103
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,830
My Lord.

104
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,400
You’re in Dongdu now.

105
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,110
It's better to save trouble.

106
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,159
Alright.

107
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,390
I see.

108
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,390
Take them.

109
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,230
Yes.

110
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,070
Let’s go!

111
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,070
Lord Lu!

112
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,430
We would like to clear this up in person!

113
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,159
My Lord.

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,350
Alright.

115
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,510
What do you want to say?

116
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,600
My Lord.

117
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,040
We didn’t kill

118
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,270
someone innocent.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,790
He once killed our master

120
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,500
and bullied men and women.

121
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,640
We killed him as a public service.

122
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,680
What's wrong with that?

123
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,720
I understand why you're here.

124
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,550
All territories belong to the emperor.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,100
If you kill at the feet of the emperor,

126
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,390
you must confess your crimes.

127
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,790
My Lord.

128
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,760
No offence.

129
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,700
But we who practice martial arts know

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,270
that killing someone to revenge death

131
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,600
is the right thing to do.

132
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,550
If it’s the right thing to do,

133
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,670
then, what’s wrong with it?

134
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,880
There is no law says

135
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,350
that killing someone to revenge death is right.

136
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,230
These are just

137
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,640
your self-righteous hoodlums

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
looking for an excuse

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
for your own violence!

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,790
Take them!

141
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,510
Yes!

142
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,200
Let's go!

143
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,920
My Lord!

144
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,159
As a Lord,

145
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,000
you interfere in the world of martial arts,

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
isn’t it inappropriate?

147
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,159
How dare you!

148
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,720
The rule of law has no exception!

149
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,600
If people think they can avoid the law

150
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,320
by killing in the world of martial arts,

151
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
then the whole world is in chaos!

152
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm in Dongdu, and not

153
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,860
supposed to get involved with security issues.

154
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,670
But you have

155
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,160
committed murders right under my nose!

156
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,880
I will not allow anyone

157
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,880
to be above the law!

158
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,720
Dongdu is at the feet of the emperor.

159
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,230
Even my Xiangzhou

160
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,860
is the emperor’s land!

161
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,510
No world

162
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,659
is beyond the control of the emperor.

163
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
Take them away.

164
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,350
Yes.

165
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,270
Let's go!

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,600
Go!

167
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,040
Tou.

168
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,920
Did you

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,790
just see that?

170
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,390
Did I do it

171
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,000
fairly?

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,640
You did it properly and legally.

173
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,720
It's just...

174
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,920
Just?

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,110
Just what?

176
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,640
Martial artists have

177
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,510
their own way of doing things.

178
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,510
The world is used to it.

179
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,230
I'm afraid your sudden intervention

180
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,070
will cause

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,840
resentment among the martial artists.

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,110
I'm not afraid.

183
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,320
And I don’t care.

184
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,670
As a member of the court,

185
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,920
I should

186
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,230
share the burden.

187
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,230
It is the duty of us to protect the people.

188
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,600
It is the duty of the people

189
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,950
to behave themselves.

190
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,190
This is the foundation of the law

191
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,350
and also the foundation of people's livelihood.

192
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,350
It's a foundation

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,950
that cannot be shaken.

194
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,409
No matter who it is.

195
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,150
My Lord!

196
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:44,840
My Lord!

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,790
My Lord!

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,670
Sir.

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,010
What can I do for you?

200
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,350
You're

201
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
so perceptive

202
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
and eloquent.

203
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,760
But

204
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
now that we're in Dongdu,

205
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,960
we can't afford to show our true colors.

206
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,760
Otherwise...

207
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,910
What?

208
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,910
Otherwise,

209
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,810
the crown prince will notice.

210
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,570
It’s no good to the great cause.

211
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,670
What great cause

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,710
do you think I’m up to?

213
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,200
Well…

214
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,240
I wouldn’t dare to guess.

215
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,590
But I

216
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,050
will do my best to help you.

217
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,080
Shut up!

218
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,350
You must have lost it!

219
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,640
The crown prince and I

220
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,400
are of the same blood.

221
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,110
I cannot think of

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
any reason against him.

223
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,640
I dealt with these men

224
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,880
because I wanted to.

225
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,230
I care about the world

226
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,670
because I want to care!

227
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,550
That's the way it is.

228
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,990
There’s no intention

229
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,110
to take anything.

230
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,030
If you

231
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,280
want to help me

232
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,350
take over the throne,

233
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,110
then you might

234
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,840
as well find another job.

235
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,320
I

236
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,760
dare not keep you here.

237
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,230
I’m sorry!

238
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,710
I’m sorry!

239
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,110
I’m the one with vile mind.

240
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,160
It's alright if you misunderstand me,

241
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,440
but don't make it worse

242
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,470
and let the world

243
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,440
misunderstand me.

244
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,150
Yes.

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,030
It’s my fault!

246
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
It’s my fault!

247
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,400
Sir.

248
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,590
If you have time to apologize here,

249
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,590
why don't you go

250
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,440
hand out those invitations for me?

251
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,960
This time,

252
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,590
don't misunderstand things again.

253
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes!

254
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,590
Yes!

255
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,400
Leader.

256
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,350
What?

257
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,520
Your letter.

258
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,900
[The Hall of Flames; Lord Lu’s Mansion; Shangguan Zheng]

259
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,550
From whom?

260
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,350
Lord Lu’s wife.

261
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,380
[Leader Chong, ever since I saw you last time,
I’ve been missing you.
Please come to Dongdu and meet with me.]

262
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,440
Chief.

263
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,640
Chief.

264
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,520
Chief.

265
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,600
A letter for you.

266
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,180
[Lord Lu; Xue Lie]

267
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,350
I disagree.

268
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,640
Muyuan.

269
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,260
Think about it.

270
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,200
The court

271
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,990
is rushing these knives.

272
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,110
But she chose this time

273
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,280
to invite you there.

274
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,470
Don't you think

275
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,520
that's weird?

276
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,520
But,

277
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,030
she wouldn't

278
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,840
have written to me if she didn't

279
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,020
have something important to tell me.

280
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,200
That's true.

281
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,010
But now things wait to be done here.

282
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
You are the leader,

283
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,790
if you go to the dinner,

284
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,920
what will disciples

285
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,000
think of you?

286
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,280
That's why

287
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,900
I came to discuss with you.

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,030
Growing up,

289
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,250
I did everything your way.

290
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
But I still find this letter rather odd.

291
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,650
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.

292
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,960
There's so much confusion in my mind.

293
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,350
If I don't go,

294
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,850
how am I supposed to answer my questions?

295
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,250
You're not here to discuss with me.

296
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,840
You've already made your decision.

297
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,030
Fine.

298
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,660
If you insist on going,

299
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
promise me one thing.

300
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,520
Go ahead.

301
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,230
Let me go with you.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,150
Why did Lord Lu invite you to Dongdu?

303
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,120
We've been at odds with the Hall of Flames.

304
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,400
I guess Lord Lu

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
knew we lost the battle,

306
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,730
and he wanted to mediate

307
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,910
in order to

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,520
keep the peace.

309
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,590
Is this Lord

310
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,760
that kind?

311
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,740
Lord Lu has a good reputation.

312
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,640
His word

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,790
is trustworthy.

314
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Are you

315
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,330
really willing to make peace with the Hall of Flames?

316
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,320
The world is full of chaos.

317
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,630
To avenge your grandfather,

318
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,280
I've been

319
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,440
fighting all these years.

320
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm tired.

321
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,850
Ever since I found you,

322
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
I've been so grateful,

323
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,770
I don't want to fight anymore.

324
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,550
I guess

325
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,400
your grandfather

326
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,590
wouldn’t want to pass hatred

327
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,150
on to you and your brother.

328
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

329
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,980
As long as our Huashan Sect

330
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,400
is safe and strong,

331
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,200
I will listen to you

332
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,490
and give up the hatred of the last generation.

333
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,120
Oh, right.

334
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,120
Since it's a mediation,

335
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,470
I'm sure

336
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,840
Leader Chong will be there.

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,230
She’ll be there?

338
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,440
Alright then,

339
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,030
I’ll go with you.

340
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,840
Good.

341
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,030
Then you

342
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,790
need to pack your bags now.

343
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,080
We’re leaving.

344
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,880
Tou.

345
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,230
I beat you three times already.

346
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,640
Lord Lu,

347
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,350
your skill is excellent.

348
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,840
I’m no match for you.

349
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,760
I’m not excellent.

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,840
Just a little bit better than you.

351
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,960
You're a free and easy player.

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
The game shows what you are.

353
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,350
But you failed to see the bigger picture.

354
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,320
And I

355
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
can keep in mind every single piece

356
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,350
of threats.

357
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,350
So I

358
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,810
can see the whole picture.

359
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,320
Tou.

360
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,000
The world is like this board.

361
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,840
It is not the pieces

362
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,520
but the players

363
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,930
that really control the board.

364
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,780
Would you rather be a piece

365
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,080
or a player?

366
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,670
I'm

367
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,840
only willing to be an ordinary man

368
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,970
who enjoys himself.

369
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
That’s all I want.

370
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,110
I have no intention of the big picture

371
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,310
and I’m not capable of

372
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,120
being other people’s piece.

373
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,350
Tou.

374
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,230
You're selling yourself short.

375
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,030
You're not a piece.

376
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,170
You're good enough

377
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,880
to be a player.

378
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
I know you don’t want to be an official.

379
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,550
So you turned down my brother.

380
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,670
And I

381
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,030
would never ask you to.

382
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,880
What I really want

383
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,520
is for you

384
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,950
to play this game with me.

385
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,910
You can do

386
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,410
whatever you want with this game.

387
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,640
Alright?

388
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,080
Whatever I want?

389
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,550
Do you know

390
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,520
what I want to do now?

391
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,400
All I want to do now

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,710
is to stop playing this game.

393
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,760
We can

394
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,890
discuss this later.

395
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,790
Leader.

396
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,590
A letter from Lord Lu.

397
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,760
Lord Lu?

398
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,200
Right.

399
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Off you go.

400
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,520
Yes.

401
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,840
Lord Lu's trying to mediate between

402
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,040
the Hall of Flames and the Huashan Sect.

403
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,200
Why do I have to be there?

404
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,810
I’ve been avoiding these matters.

405
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,670
But I still

406
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,250
can’t do things on my will.

407
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,080
You're

408
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,880
in a good mood today.

409
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,190
That’s because

410
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,829
you’re here with me.

411
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,920
But

412
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm sure you'll be in a better mood later.

413
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,560
Why?

414
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,069
You'll see.

415
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,990
You've learned to keep secrets.

416
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,760
Tou.

417
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,400
I'll send for you later.

418
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Don't be late.

419
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Sure.

420
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,000
Beauty.

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There you are!

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,460
I've been waiting for you.

423
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
Feng She?

424
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you doing here?

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
If I tell you,

426
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,760
can you promise me you won't get mad?

427
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,640
You go first.

428
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,710
Actually…

429
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,160
Actually, Feng Cheng's my father.

430
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm here with him today.

431
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,680
Who?

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,280
How could

433
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,350
Feng Cheng be your father?

434
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,800
Man Feiyue told me.

435
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,830
I knew it when you came to

436
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,090
Divine Spirit Temple.

437
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,590
But I never made up my mind

438
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,990
to go to the Huashan Sect.

439
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,000
I knew that Feng Cheng was notorious.

440
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,040
Not only did he abandon my mother,

441
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,400
but he also let that crazy Man Feiyue

442
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
abuse me for years without coming to me.

443
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,070
He isn’t a very nice man or a good father.

444
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,400
But I've given it a lot of thought.

445
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,520
After all,

446
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,430
kinship is not something I can just cut.

447
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,490
I didn’t know all this before.

448
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,640
But now I do.

449
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
So I wonder what it's like to have a home.

450
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Beauty.

451
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,710
Will you ignore me on this?

452
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,760
Ignore you

453
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,400
or not

454
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,290
can’t change the fact that he is your father.

455
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,520
Even if Feng Cheng is a villain,

456
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,000
if he is really nice to you,

457
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,230
I'd be happy for you.

458
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,160
Feng She!

459
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,810
Chief Guardian.

460
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,160
She already said that.

461
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,730
Are you still trying to stop me?

462
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,590
The Leader just said she'd be happy for you.

463
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,090
But she didn't say you can hold her.

464
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
If you're friends with Leader,

465
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,920
you should

466
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,280
care for her.

467
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,000
All right, all right.

468
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,040
Feng Cheng came here today

469
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,350
to make peace with you.

470
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,350
Otherwise, I wouldn't be with him.

471
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,430
I came all this way for you.

472
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,110
Make peace?

473
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,920
Shangguan Zheng said

474
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,610
it’s just a gathering.

475
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,000
Nothing about making peace.

476
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Shangguan Zheng?

477
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,160
Beauty,

478
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,320
are you back with Shangguan Tou?

479
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,110
We will meet Her Highness later.

480
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,660
Are you coming with us?

481
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,560
I have no excuse to see her.

482
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,490
Then you should leave.

483
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,800
Muyuan.

484
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,180
Are you questioning Feng She?

485
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,590
No, I’m not.

486
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,430
It's just

487
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,940
Feng Cheng's here,

488
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,810
and he wants to make peace.

489
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,710
Do you still think it’s

490
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,050
Her Highness who wants to see you?

491
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,710
It must be Lord Lu.

492
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,230
So, later,

493
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,800
we see Her Highness as soon as possible

494
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
and then we leave.

495
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
We can’t stay.

496
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,590
Ms. Chong.

497
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,830
Your Highness.

498
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,230
That’s alright.

499
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,430
It's been a long time.

500
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
Your Highness.

501
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,710
I'm Chief Guardian Muyuan of the Hall of Flames.

502
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,240
Because the Hall of Flames had been ambushed.

503
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,430
It's a bit of a chaotic situation.

504
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,160
So, it's really not reassuring.

505
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,430
I'm here with my Leader.

506
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,830
I hope you'll forgive me.

507
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,310
Of course.

508
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,070
It’s a long journey.

509
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,560
You said in your letter

510
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
that you had something to tell us.

511
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
What is it?

512
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
It's nothing.

513
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,040
Guardian just said

514
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,920
the Hall of Flames was under attack.

515
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,280
What's going on?

516
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,830
It's in the past.

517
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,310
We've lost a lot.

518
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,430
But I'm confident

519
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,760
I can get through this.

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,920
That's good.

521
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,830
You are not the same

522
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,040
as last time we met.

523
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,160
I was too young and naive.

524
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Not at all.

525
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,330
I liked you the last time I saw you.

526
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,870
You're sweet and direct.

527
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,920
You and Tou are very different.

528
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,950
The famous Leader Chong is here.

529
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,150
Zheng didn’t tell me.

530
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,680
Made me lose my manners.

531
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,160
Your Highness.

532
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,230
Ms. Chong.

533
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,590
How have you been?

534
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,110
And this is…

535
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,710
This is Chief Guardian Muyuan.

536
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,590
He's here with Ms. Chong.

537
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,970
Chief Guardian Muyuan.

538
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,040
I've heard so much about you.

539
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,300
You’re indeed extraordinary in person.

540
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,640
I wanted to talk some private matters.

541
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,990
Now that Chief Guardian is here,

542
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,880
why don't

543
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,810
we put our personal matters on hold

544
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,350
and we'll settle business first?

545
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
Please, Your Highness.

546
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
A few days ago,

547
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,000
I heard of another incident.

548
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,230
Huashan Sect fought you and lost.

549
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,040
You're both very well-known sects.

550
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,070
You have joined me

551
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,190
in the relief effort.

552
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,000
You’ve done people of Xiangzhou a great service.

553
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,710
I really don't want to see you

554
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,560
both get hurt because of an old grudge.

555
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,760
Whatever it is,

556
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,110
it's true that my father killed Feng.

557
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,760
We knew we were in the wrong,

558
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,710
so we put up with it for years.

559
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,590
But the Huashan Sect is very aggressive.

560
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,040
If the Huashan Sect attacked us,

561
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,400
and we did nothing,

562
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,230
then I shouldn’t be the leader.

563
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,520
I didn't mean to provoke.

564
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,640
Ms. Chong.

565
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,400
Don't get me wrong.

566
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
I have no intention of blaming you.

567
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,520
It's just that Chief Feng is recovering here.

568
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,070
And you and Chief Guardian are visiting.

569
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,570
Why don't we all sit down together

570
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
and talk this out?

571
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,010
I've also invited Tou and Leader Lin.

572
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,950
They both from the martial world

573
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,490
and official families.

574
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,830
With them as witnesses,

575
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,800
this mediation

576
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,730
is bound to bear fruit.

577
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,170
Would you be so kind

578
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,160
to join us for dinner?

579
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,830
If we can make up with the Huashan Sect,

580
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,430
we'd love to go to the dinner.

581
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,880
Good. Very good.

582
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,520
Your Highness.

583
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,160
Your Highness.

584
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,040
Xuezhi?

585
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,280
What are you…

586
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,590
Tou.

587
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,070
Ms. Chong is my guest.

588
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,190
If you have something to talk about,

589
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,640
why don't we do it later?

590
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,710
Have a seat.

591
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,800
Everyone.

592
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,520
We've been in Dongdu for a few days.

593
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,430
We’re about to go back.

594
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,470
I'm holding this banquet to say goodbye.

595
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,210
We are all family and friends here.

596
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,830
Don't stand on ceremony.

597
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,710
I'm in a hurry.

598
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
There's nothing to entertain you.

599
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,950
Only this meat is delicious.

600
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,110
People outside call it Panlong Bird.

601
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,880
This chicken comes from a cold place.

602
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,470
Usually,

603
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,760
they come out in small groups.

604
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,160
They only scatter when they're feeding.

605
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,710
So,

606
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,950
they’re not easy to be captured.

607
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,400
These chickens know

608
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,330
birds of a feather flock together.

609
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Better to be alone

610
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:29,000
than to live in a busy city.

611
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,590
Uncle is right.

612
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,950
These chickens are certainly simpler

613
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,170
than people gathering for interests.

614
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,620
Your Highness.

615
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,590
Like this chicken,

616
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,090
I have been foraging alone for many years.

617
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,710
I can’t take being your uncle.

618
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,450
Your Highness is well-informed.

619
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,110
We're all sitting together today.

620
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,830
This meat

621
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,470
is worth a try.

622
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,800
Chief Feng was wrong about me.

623
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,830
I was sick when I was young,

624
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,810
so I had to learn.

625
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,400
That’s why I know about food tonic.

626
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,350
But I only know a few.

627
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
Not like Leader Chong

628
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,710
who has strong inner power.

629
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,280
If I were like Leader Chong,

630
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,950
I wouldn’t

631
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,520
have to learn about these boring things.

632
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,620
Your Highness.

633
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,430
I practiced and couldn’t get it.

634
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,400
I’d like health advice from Your Highness.

635
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,280
Since Tou is interested,

636
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,760
let me tell you something about it.

637
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
The key points are

638
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,560
from the five elements of Chinese medicine.

639
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,960
Balance the five tastes.

640
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,710
It means sour, sweet, bitter, spicy and salty

641
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,980
are all important.

642
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,330
It needs to be balanced.

643
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,520
In this way,

644
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,400
bones are straight and muscles are soft.

645
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,640
So one can live long.

646
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,110
That's the same as practicing martial arts.

647
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,070
All about equal and balance.

648
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,470
Drawing inferences about other cases from one,

649
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,930
Ms. Chong is indeed smart.

650
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,040
Really smart.

651
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,680
Once it’s not balanced,

652
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,540
one may get into the wrong way.

653
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,070
About this,

654
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,470
you people of the Hall of Flames

655
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,640
should know better than us.

656
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,300
Not only practicing skills is like this.

657
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,520
I’ve studied internal medicine for long.

658
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,920
I think all things are related

659
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,310
to the rule of balancing the five tastes.

660
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,880
As for this feast,

661
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,160
I share this drink with you.

662
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,560
This table is like the five elements.

663
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,000
The five of us

664
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,680
are like one body.

665
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,430
Please enlighten us.

666
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,310
Chief Feng.

667
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,330
A man like you with fire inside your lung,

668
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,520
health advice won’t be

669
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,400
of much help.

670
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,160
Tou is right.

671
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
Lung corresponds to Metal.

672
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Mainly for the governance of cleaning.

673
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,800
It eliminates the internal flow of toxics.

674
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,070
That's the Huashan Sect’s way.

675
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
Moving

676
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
like a shape knife cutting grasses.

677
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,960
One will be worth a hundred.

678
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,340
I wonder when Huashan Sect

679
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,160
attacked us,

680
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,160
whose grasses were being cut?

681
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,560
Leader Chong.

682
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,470
She is in charge of the Hall of Flames.

683
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,400
Like the name,

684
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,590
she is the flames.

685
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,560
Achieving great while still young

686
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,040
makes her burn others a little.

687
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,710
Besides,

688
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,110
Huashan Sect was wrong at first.

689
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,620
On behalf of Huashan Sect,

690
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,810
I’ll take one as self-punishment.

691
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,600
Fire corresponds to Heart.

692
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,500
Heart is in charge of blood

693
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
and pulse.

694
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,570
Your sect’s former Leader’s blood and pulse.

695
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,400
The position of the Hall of Flames

696
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,680
is no less important.

697
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,560
At the center of martial art world’s pulses.

698
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,560
I think it fits.

699
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,310
What do

700
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,110
you think, Leader Chong?

701
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,380
Your Highness.

702
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,290
The heart is the king of five viscera.

703
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,950
Only a royal like you fit.

704
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,430
Tou.

705
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,430
I think Tou should be Wood.

706
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,450
Wood corresponds to liver.

707
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,160
Gentle and steady, the master of release.

708
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,560
But also can make things right when it’s wrong.

709
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,880
The duty of Imperial Advisor.

710
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,280
Uncle Lin.

711
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,280
I think Uncle Lin should be Earth.

712
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,470
Earth corresponds to spleen.

713
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,680
Governs transport, carries, and accepts.

714
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,000
The remonstrant in the five viscera.

715
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,800
Uncle Lin may have changed fate,

716
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,880
abandoned the court and went into the outside,

717
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,810
but you’re still

718
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,370
an important subject of the emperor.

719
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
This way.

720
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,400
Your Highness should be Water.

721
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,720
Water benefits all things yet doesn’t fight.

722
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,560
Water corresponds to kidney.

723
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,490
The kidney governs essence and Qi.

724
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,280
Essence gathers talents all over the world.

725
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,950
Qi adjusts bad relations.

726
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,520
You are a better talker.

727
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,590
I like to be Water.

728
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,760
Engendering and restraining of the five
are natural.

729
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,110
Too much restraining is overwhelming.

730
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,280
Too little restraining is

731
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,350
mutual rebellion.

732
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,000
Like now,

733
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,190
two out of five

734
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,920
are inverse.

735
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,590
I want to do my best

736
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,040
and make them right.

737
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,310
Huashan Sect

738
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,560
accepts your kindness.

739
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,950
Please enlighten us.

740
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,040
What is right?

741
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,920
Heart controls blood; lung controls Qi.

742
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,950
The two must be connected.

743
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,230
If they don’t,

744
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,440
there will be troubles.

745
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
May I ask

746
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,040
how to connect them?

747
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,110
Unity brings connection.

748
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,190
Here.

749
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,350
I would like to

750
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,470
drink with you all.

751
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,950
Tou.

752
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,040
You don’t drink my toast.

753
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,330
Aren't you afraid of hurting your sister?

754
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,230
Ms. Chong.

755
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,590
Don't you want to fix it?

756
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,520
Fixing things with martial arts world

757
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,280
is our desire.

758
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,560
But I dare not

759
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,680
drink this one.

760
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,470
Ms. Chong.

761
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,430
His Highness means good.

762
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,800
It’s just a drink.

763
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,350
No other intentions.

764
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,350
The real intention of this drink

765
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,040
is clear to Your Highness and me.

766
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,110
Over the years, we have forged

767
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,680
weapons for the court.

768
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,310
Because forging weapons

769
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,070
is something we can do.

770
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,620
So it's incumbent upon us.

771
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,760
But we don't know anything

772
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,520
except how to forge weapons.

773
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,000
I really

774
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,190
dare not drink this.

775
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,630
I hope you'll forgive me.

776
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,350
It's just a glass of wine.

777
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,700
You insist on not drinking it,

778
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,950
then I can’t force you, can I?

779
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,210
Your Highness.

780
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,950
I’d like to toast on behalf of Hall of Flames.

781
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,330
I'll vouch for the Hall of Flames.

782
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,350
As long as the Huashan Sect isn’t trying,

783
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,880
the world

784
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,430
will be in peace.

785
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,470
But if Chief Feng

786
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,110
has to win,

787
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,800
then you

788
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,920
have to crush me first.

789
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Your Highness.

790
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Thank you for your hospitality.

791
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,560
We have important business to attend to.

792
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Excuse us.

793
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,000
Xuezhi.

794
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,090
You wait for me…

795
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,310
Thanks, Master Shangguan.

796
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,920
But this is Lord Lu's family dinner,

797
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,950
you can’t leave.

798
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,880
Xuezhi!

799
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,710
Little beauty! Little beauty!

800
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,400
Why are you running so fast?

801
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,560
Feng She.

802
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,030
You tell me honestly.

803
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,360
What’s Feng Cheng’s deal with Xue Lie?

804
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,680
Isn't Lord Lu supposed to be a peacemaker?

805
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,710
What deal?

806
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,280
Seeing how aggressive Lord Lu was today,

807
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,880
you think he’s making peace?

808
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,470
Little beauty.

809
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,000
You don't trust me anymore?

810
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,800
I really don't know

811
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,000
what Lord Lu has to do with Huashan Sect.

812
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,110
But I can assure you that

813
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,880
Feng Cheng has no intention of harming you.

814
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
He promised me he'd let you go.

815
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,240
Otherwise, I would never come with him.

816
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,640
Leader Chong.

817
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,000
Her Highness asks you to come.

818
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,770
Her Highness asks Leader,

819
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,190
then why sent you?

820
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,950
Because there’re only two masters
in the mansion.

821
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,680
His Highness and Her Highness.

822
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,160
Chief Guardian.

823
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,370
Lord Lu wants to see you.

824
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,230
Does it make any difference?

825
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:13,950
It does.

826
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,870
Because Her Highness and Master Shangguan

827
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,160
are waiting at Imperial Advisor’s Mansion.

828
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,800
And Lord Lu

829
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,860
is waiting at side garden.

830
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,430
Imperial Advisor’s Mansion?

831
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,950
Seeing parents already?

832
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,520
No way.

833
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,310
I must stay with my leader.

834
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,230
Chief Guardian.

835
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,590
Your leader has just humiliated Lord,

836
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,190
isn’t it enough?

837
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,470
Muyuan.

838
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,510
It’s alright.

839
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Feng She can come with me.

840
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,410
I have something important to ask him.

841
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,590
Chief Guardian, don't worry.

842
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,040
If anything happens to her,

843
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,950
I'm all yours.

844
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,350
I have no interest.

845
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,330
I don't want anything to happen to Xuezhi.

846
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,330
Just remember,

847
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,640
keep Xuezhi safe.

848
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,470
Don't worry, Muyuan.

849
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,400
I'll be right back. You be careful.

850
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:17,389
Chief Guardian.

851
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,949
What are you doing back here?

852
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,520
I was told you wanted to see me.

853
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,850
I asked you to come back?

854
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,630
Says who?

855
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,080
Your special envoy.

856
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:25,469
Guards.

857
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,429
Feng She.

858
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,710
Why did you and Feng Cheng come to Dongdu?

859
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,670
You tell me exactly what happened.

860
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,040
Here's the thing.

861
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,870
Your Highness.

862
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,120
He is not in the house.

863
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,250
Everything's gone.

864
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,469
Useless!

865
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,389
Make sure someone gets him back!

866
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,870
Yes.

867
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,150
May I ask

868
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,840
is Her Highness expecting my leader?

869
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,800
That's not possible.

870
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,280
Tou and her are talking in the bedroom.

871
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,760
Guards.

872
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,650
Tell Master Shangguan,

873
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,870
Ms. Chong is being held hostage.

874
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,630
Yes.

875
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,910
Sister!

876
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,710
Did you ever

877
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,120
think about this place

878
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,910
and what kind of person Feng Cheng is?

879
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,360
How could you bring Xuezhi to Dongdu

880
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,670
without consulting me first?

881
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,080
Tou.

882
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,430
I don't want to see you

883
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,150
and Ms. Chong like this.

884
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,320
I want to mediate.

885
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,430
This was Lord Lu's idea?

886
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,670
You think

887
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,670
he's plotting against Ms. Chong?

888
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,440
How can you even think that?

889
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,870
Lord Lu is my husband.

890
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,670
He's your brother-in-law, too.

891
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,190
Master.

892
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,080
Ms. Chong's been taken.

893
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,840
What?

894
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,910
Chief Feng.

895
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,290
Master Feng She is on the ride.

896
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,930
I'll leave you to it.

897
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,910
Thank you.

898
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,150
It's all for Lord Lu.

899
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,610
No need to say thank you.

900
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,950
I’ve already shown my face,

901
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,000
so please make sure this is done.

902
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,980
Otherwise,

903
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,440
me and Lord Lu couldn’t explain ourselves.

904
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,520
Don't worry about it.

905
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,410
Lord has already planned everything.

906
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,040
Go!

907
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,150
Feng Cheng!

908
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,760
What is this?

909
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,670
I’m Lord Lu’s man!

910
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,120
Your rebellion.

911
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,950
There's no place in Lord Lu's Mansion

912
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,950
for a man of your ambition.

913
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,000
Lord Lu is indeed a son of the emperor.

914
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,120
Give up a pawn to save the king.

915
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,150
What a

916
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,670
vicious plan!

917
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:09,950
Father!

918
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
Feng Cheng.

919
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,320
How dare you

920
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,280
kill a man of Lord Lu!

921
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,950
Under the name of Lord Lu,

922
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,840
this man tried to take you hostage.

923
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,700
It didn't work.

924
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,900
He killed himself.

925
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,040
Father.

926
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,390
You saved us.

927
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,670
Son.

928
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,830
If it weren't for you,

929
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,320
how could the Leader be so careless

930
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,190
as to inhale my poison?

931
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,560
Poison?

932
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,280
Father!

933
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,190
You!

934
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,560
Feng Cheng.

935
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,280
What do you want?

936
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,120
Nothing.

937
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,000
It’s a shame we didn’t fix things in Dongdu.

938
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,150
I'd like you

939
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,120
to come to Huashan for a visit.

940
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,560
In your dream!

941
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,390
Being poisoned and still fighting.

942
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,130
Nine Moves of Lotus God is really something.

943
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,520
Feng She!

944
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,660
Little beauty!

945
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,430
Take her.

946
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,950
This bastard.

947
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,320
He is tipping them off.

948
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,340
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

949
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,600
Did you find Leader?

950
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,560
Please relax.

951
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,930
He’s a just scholar.

952
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,010
He won't do anything to the Leader.

953
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,470
It’s my fault that I didn’t know him well.

954
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,840
That’s it?

955
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,390
What do you mean?

956
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,390
Are you questioning me?

957
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,160
Though I intend to befriend the Hall of Flames,

958
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,910
it's a personal favor.

959
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,710
As a lord,

960
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,150
the Hall of Flames is there or not

961
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,760
doesn’t matter to me.

962
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,970
Chief Guardian!

963
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,210
Chief Guardian!

964
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,150
Little beauty…

965
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,840
Where's Xuezhi?

966
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,670
Little beauty…

967
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,520
Huashan Sect…

968
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,650
Do you know how much I wanted to catch you?

969
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,100
I've imagined this scenario many times.

970
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,470
Today,

971
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,080
I finally got what I wanted.

972
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,950
Heaven helps me.

973
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,000
Feng Cheng.

974
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,390
If you hate me so much,

975
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,780
might as well make it quick

976
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,040
and just kill me.

977
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:43,850
Hate you?

978
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,160
I don't hate you.

979
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Chong Xuezhi.

980
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,840
Why would I hate

981
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,950
a stupid, naive little girl?

982
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,040
You just have the wrong family.

983
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
If you weren't Chong Ye's daughter,

984
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,950
you'd be living a normal life right now.

985
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,690
Don’t you think?

986
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,190
The only thing I admire about you

987
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,150
is your persistence

988
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,320
in avenging your father.

989
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I didn't realize

990
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,430
you were faking your filial piety.

991
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,870
In the name of killing bad,

992
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,000
you're just trying to get Lotus Wing.

993
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,000
Shame on you!

994
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,120
Despicable!

995
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,320
Didn't your father teach you anything?

996
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,080
Everyone in this world is a hypocrite.

997
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,470
No hypocrite, no martial arts world.

998
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,840
In this world,

999
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,250
don't judge a hero by his morality,

1000
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,000
only by his strength!

1001
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,870
Your Hall of Flames was

1002
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,000
the number one sect

1003
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,840
because of the power of Lotus Wing,

1004
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
not the character of Chong Ye.

1005
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,710
My father was a righteous man!

1006
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,880
You are in no position to judge him!

1007
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,840
Fine.

1008
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,870
Let's not talk about him.

1009
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,570
Tell me the Nine Moves of Lotus God

1010
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,000
and the Lotus Sutra.

1011
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,760
Bring it.

1012
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:31,870
This

1013
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,600
is the burning of the western regions.

1014
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,710
Most people don't last two days.

1015
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,870
Even if you're protected by the Lotus Sutra,

1016
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,670
in four days,

1017
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,120
you’ll be a dried-up corpse.

1018
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Unless,

1019
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,390
you write Lotus Wing down.

1020
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,430
You wish.

1021
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,560
Good.

1022
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,010
Your Highness.

1023
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,470
Young master is fine.

1024
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,800
Just need some rest.

1025
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,620
Thank you, physician.

1026
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,040
Your Highness!

1027
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,100
May I take a look at this piece of gold?
