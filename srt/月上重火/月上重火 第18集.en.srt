00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 18

4
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
Actually, I have

5
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,979
something important to tell you.

6
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,730
There are no outsiders now.

7
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,680
I can tell you without concern.

8
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,160
Uncle. What is it?

9
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
I thought

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
you didn’t have to

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,090
learn too much about your fathers.

12
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
You’d have burden

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,079
if you knew it.

14
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,900
But if I didn’t tell you anything,

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
you’d never know

16
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
the truth.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,930
I thought it over

18
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,920
and still decided to tell you.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,800
Mr. Lin.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,680
I know

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,250
you have your plans.

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Since we can’t change

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
the things of our fathers,

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,720
why not just let them go?

25
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,920
Muyuan,

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
you’re a good kid,

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,250
but Xuezhi has grown up.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
She should have her own opinion

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
on something.

30
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,920
Uncle,

31
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,120
Muyuan,

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,520
are you hiding something from me?

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,120
Xuezhi,

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,840
how much do you know

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
about your dad?

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,240
Word out there says

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,040
my dad killed many martial artists

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,240
because he    become  mad  with the martial art training

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
But I think he was through some hardships

40
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,360
because he was a good person.

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,320
You’re right.

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,360
Your dad was a decent man.

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
A great martial artist, and a virtuous man.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,720
It all started from

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,380
the Hero Assembly 15 years ago

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,440
where your dad, Chong Ye,

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,720
I,

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
and Muyuan’s dad,

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
Yuwen Yupan...

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,040
We got to know each other

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
through a fight.

52
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,680
We appreciated each other

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,210
and became sworn brothers.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Then your dad Chong Ye

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,960
invited us to the Hall of Flames.

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,200
The three of us

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
often exchanged martial skills

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,660
and had wine together.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
Then your dad

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
merged all our moves

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,170
into one improved move.

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
He named it

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,530
Nine Moves of Lotus God.

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,120
And Yupan

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
merged our inner power

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,500
into one heart method,

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,560
which is the Lotus Sutra.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,530
If one practices them both,

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,420
he or she will the best of the best.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,720
That’s

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,730
the origin story of Lotus Wing.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,240
Ye,

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,120
what’s the rush?

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,840
I’ve finally finished

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
the two sutras.

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
With them,

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,520
we’re the greatest martial artists
in the world.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,580
Congratulations.

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,659
Congratulations.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,800
Ye,

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
martial training is all about

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,820
improving and challenging oneself.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Ye,

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
why are you so obsessed?

85
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Yupan, don’t you

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,920
want to do something bigger?

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,200
But

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,860
improvement is made step by step.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
It can’t be rushed.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,720
If the Hall of Flames were to earn its name,

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,280
I must train hard.

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,700
Chong Ye was the best among us.

93
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,280
He became the first one to
grasp Nine Moves.

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
But back then, we didn’t know

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
that the two sutras supported
one another.

96
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
Yet he

97
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,000
only practiced Nine Moves.

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,120
He bypassed Lotus Sutra.

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,960
That’s why

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,080
he was driven into mania.

101
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,640
Mania?

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,280
Every time Nine Moves backfired on him,

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Chong Ye became a different person.

104
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,760
He would become cruel

105
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,580
and have no control over himself.

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,880
In the next two years,

107
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,250
he missed every Hero Assembly,

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,500
claiming he wasn’t feeling well.

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
No wonder

110
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,560
dad barely visited me those years.

111
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,200
Although he became a maniac,

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,040
humanity was still with him.

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,440
He was worried he might harm
innocent people,

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
so every time he had an outbreak of mania,

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,340
he’d order disciples to lock himself up.

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,720
But we didn’t see

117
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,580
the remaining humanity was decreasing.

118
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,080
Dad!

119
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Dad!

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480
Dad!

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,080
He even begged us to kill him,

122
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,280
to end his misery.

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,159
You may have heard of this.

124
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
“Shattered hairpin and broken mirror,”

125
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,140
“flames burn in the human world.”

126
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
“End all of your bonding”

127
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,800
“to achieve Lotus Wing.”

128
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
If you went into mania

129
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
when practicing Nine Moves,

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,440
you’d have to kill your family

131
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
to free yourself from earthly bonding

132
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,240
and desires,

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,460
to become one with the sky,

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
to destroy evils.

135
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,480
So

136
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,040
Yupan came up with an extreme solution,

137
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,420
which was trading his life

138
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,280
for Chong Ye’s humanity.

139
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,890
Brother, you cannot go.

140
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,720
Brother,

141
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
please,

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,120
let me go.

143
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
I can’t save one brother

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
at the price of another.

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
Sober up,

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,760
we’re out of options.

147
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,320
This is the only way.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
I can’t watch our big brother

149
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,370
suffer anymore.

150
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,070
There must be other ways.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,960
Think again.

152
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
Kill me.

153
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,880
Kill me.

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,400
Die.

155
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Kill me.

156
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,560
So

157
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
my dad asked for his death.

158
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
In order to save his dearest friend,

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,180
your dad sacrificed himself.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Yupan demonstrated friendship with his life.

161
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,250
I tried to stop him multiple times,

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
but this very thought

163
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,560
had rooted in his heart.

164
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
There was no way back.

165
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,040
Perhaps he blamed

166
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
himself for

167
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,920
creating Nine Moves,

168
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,840
which led Chong Ye into mania.

169
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,160
So...

170
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,480
So later, my dad...

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,930
Your dad thought

172
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,130
he killed Yupan with his own hands.

173
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,380
He was devastated.

174
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,160
He went back to normal,

175
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
but he was already

176
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,120
notorious at the time.

177
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,920
All sects

178
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,380
sieged the Hall of Flames,

179
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,530
demanding for your dad
and the two sutras.

180
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,640
But your dad knew that

181
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
the two sutras

182
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,760
meant everything

183
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,240
to the Hall of Flames.

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,060
To protect the sutras,

185
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,200
he had to die.

186
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,170
Maybe the greatest weight on his heart

187
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,840
was killing his own brother.

188
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,250
The reason why I left the Hall of Flames

189
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,620
was because I felt immensely guilty.

190
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,280
If my death could

191
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
allow either of them to live,

192
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,860
I wouldn’t be so dejected.

193
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
But ashes to ashes.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Today,

195
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,600
the reason I tell you the truth

196
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,890
is I hope you can understand

197
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,440
that your fathers

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
were both honorable men.

199
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,720
They both sacrificed themselves

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
for others’ benefit.

201
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,720
I hope

202
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
you won’t have doubts against

203
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,880
your fathers when you hear

204
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,600
unproven words from others.

205
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,050
Because any suspicion against

206
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,080
people like them would

207
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,280
be a great insult.

208
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,920
The history of the martial world

209
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,880
can’t be told as a short story.

210
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,040
Revenge

211
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,120
never ends.

212
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What’s in the past

213
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
stays in the past.

214
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
No matter what the last generation did,

215
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,330
no matter what hatred and gratitude they had,

216
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,320
the promises I made for my uncle,

217
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
for you,

218
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
and for the Hall of Flames

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,160
are unswerving.

220
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,600
Muyuan,

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,440
sorry.

222
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,640
It’s ok.

223
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,760
Since Shangguan Tou

224
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,180
came back from Divine Spirit Temple,

225
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,480
his inner injuries haven’t healed yet.

226
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,020
I didn’t want to bring this up,

227
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,520
but he did what I asked

228
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
him to do,

229
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,060
which was protecting you.

230
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,320
Hall of Flames owes him.

231
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,880
Back then,

232
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,130
Shangguang Tou was in trouble,

233
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,340
I passed half of my inner power to him.

234
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,210
To fulfill his promise,

235
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,840
he passed all his inner power to you.

236
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,400
Now he isn’t capable of

237
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,060
protecting himself anymore.

238
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,280
Even nasty people like Man Feiyue

239
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,200
could hurt him.

240
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,600
So

241
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,800
I’d like you to

242
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,260
impart Lotus Sutra to him.

243
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,360
Can Lotus Sutra

244
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,560
really help him recover his inner power?

245
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,200
Yes.

246
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,280
Not only it can

247
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,080
support Nine Moves practicing,

248
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,980
but it also is the best sutra for inner improvement.

249
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,960
I know that

250
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,280
in this world

251
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,130
you’re the only one that masters Lotus Sutra.

252
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
But I...

253
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,160
Xuezhi,

254
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,840
I don’t want to push too hard.

255
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,920
Think it over

256
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,160
whether or not you’re going to Moon Valley.

257
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,520
After all, aiding him in cultivation

258
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,960
will take a long time.

259
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,900
You’re now the leader of the Hall,

260
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,920
and you’re undertaking so many unfulfilled duties.

261
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
You mustn’t be impulsive.

262
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,200
Plus, seeing you’ve just

263
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
achieved Lotus Wing,

264
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
people out there

265
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
are watching you in the dark.

266
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,600
Uncle,

267
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,560
is Shangguan Tou

268
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,760
severely injured?

269
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Don’t worry.

270
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,330
Even if you don’t go to Moon Valley,

271
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
I’ll go take care of him.

272
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,120
And

273
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,880
he won’t blame you for

274
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,480
any decisions that you make.

[Hall of Flames]

276
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,920
Muyuan.

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Please look after

278
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,080
the Hall of Flames for me.

279
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,440
Don’t worry about it.

280
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,720
Be safe.

[Hall of Flames]

282
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,080
Bro,

283
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,359
you remind me of one word.

284
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,560
Great.

285
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,200
You know she’s there for Shangguan Tou,

286
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
yet you let her go.

287
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,619
Aren’t you worried that she won’t come back?

288
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
This is her home.

289
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,560
She will be back.

290
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,460
Very confident of you.

291
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,760
People like you

292
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,550
wouldn’t understand things like this.

293

Master Chong.

294
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,560
Where is your leader?

He’s resting inside.

Master Chong.

297
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
Sir,

298
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,080
look

299
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,240
who’s here.

300
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,960
Miss Chong.

301
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,920
Wuming,

302
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,260
change my clothes.

303
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes.

304
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
Sorry,

305
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,600
I didn’t see anything.

306
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,460
Honestly, I didn’t see anything.

307
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Miss Chong,

308
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
why are you here?

309
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,800
Mr. Yin,

310
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
why are you here?

311
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
This is a weird question.

312
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
This is

313
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
Moon Spring,

314
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,480
the herbal bath area in our valley.

315
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,450
Our leader is in the spring.

316
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
As one of Moon Valley people,

317
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,680
I’m here to attend to my leader.

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
I actually need to ask

319
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
why you are here.

320
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,720
What about Master Shangguan?

321
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,050
Is he severely injured?

322
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,600
It is tricky.

323
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,360
If he still had

324
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,600
his inner power,

325
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,120
with the quick healing of the herbal bath,

326
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,840
he would recover very soon.

327
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,560
But now,

328
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,000
not only has he passed his inner power to you,

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,600
but he also took a hit for you.

330
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Although I’ve treated him

331
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
with acupuncture and herbs,

332
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,100
he’s still limited to daily activities.

333
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,920
It’s extra hard for him

334
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,810
to recover the inner power.

335
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,240
If it goes on...

336
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,520
Don’t scare her, senior.

337
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,040
Do you like it?

338
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,200
As verses go,

339
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,720
“Ravishing smile,”

340
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,300
“Intoxicating eyes.”

341
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,800
You look so pretty

342
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
in these clothes.

343
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,840
How are you feeling, Master Shangguan?

344
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,120
Mr. Yin told me...

345
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,320
Don’t you know

346
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,450
what he’s like, Miss Chong?

347
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,280
He

348
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,800
always overreacts.

349
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,970
He treats every small problem
as a major disease.

350
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,650
He’s just eager to be a savior of the world.

351
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,040
Miss Chong,

352
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,200
he was bluffing.

353
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,900
I’m practically fine.

354
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,920
Master Shangguan,

355
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,160
don’t keep it from me.

356
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,280
My uncle said that you were badly injured.

357
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
This is why I’m here.

358
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,600
You’re here for me?

359
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,920
I’ve decided to impart Lotus Sutra to you

360
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,560
to facilitate the recovery of your inner power.

361
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,440
This-this isn’t a small thing.

362
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,380
I didn’t look too deep into

363
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,520
Lotus Sutra,

364
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,920
but I know one thing or two

365
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,450
about the No. 1 inner sutra.

366
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,440
Of Lotus Wing,

367
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,560
the nature of Nine Moves is Yang,

368
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,880
the nature of Lotus Sutra is Yin.

369
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,960
It’s impossible to impart someone

370
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,180
Lotus Sutra in a short period of time.

371
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Unless...

372
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,160
Unless the imparter

373
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,280
and the pupil practice together

374
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,730
so that they are connected.

375
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,240
Cut the time in half.

376
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Indeed.

377
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,160
This

378
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
would cause inconvenience

379
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,040
for you, wouldn’t it?

380
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,280
Not at all.

381
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,520
I’m here specially

382
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,280
to treat his inner injury.

383
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,440
All I want is

384
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,840
to speed up his recovery.

385
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,200
I don’t mind

386
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,770
what others may say.

387
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,000
You are more broadminded and noble

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,330
than the average person

389
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,760
Sorry for

390
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
saying negative things

391
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,280
about you previously.

392
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,080
Please don’t say that.

393
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,880
I endangered Master Shangguan multiple times.

394
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,080
If it wasn’t for your

395
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,280
great medical skills and day-and-night caring,

396
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,410
the most terrible thing would happen.

397
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,820
Every doctor has a kind heart.

398
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,890
And considering he is a decent man,

399
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,400
it’s worth it.

400
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,880
Mr. Yin,

401
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,410
I have another request.

402
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,760
Go ahead.

403
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Next,

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
I’ll be practicing Lotus Sutra

405
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,690
with Master Shangguan,

406
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
but he’s lost his inner power

407
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,000
for quite a period of time.

408
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,280
Judging from his current physical condition,

409
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,210
vital energy transfusion through

410
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,640
the sudden opening of meridians

411
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,520
would be too much for him to handle.

412
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,440
Please you may prescribe him

413
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,840
some physical strengthening medications.

414
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,880
Replenish his energy with medicine

415
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
to get him through the cultivation.

416
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,860
How thoughtful of you.

417
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,000
I, Yin Ci,

418
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
will do everything I can.

419
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,500
Thank you, Mr. Yin.

420
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Of all the things you said,

421
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
I guess the only two words

422
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,570
that Master Shangguan can remember is...

423
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,680
Lotus Sutra.

424
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,640
No.

425
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,240
It should be

426
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,440
“For me”.

427
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,040
Enough, Mr. Yin.

428
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,760
Master Shangguan,

429
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,440
your clothes are still wet.

430
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Why

431
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,640
don’t you change your clothes

432
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,170
in case you may catch a cold?

433
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,360
With you around,

434
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
Miss Chong, my heart feels warm.

435
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,930
I won’t catch a cold.

436
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
Not just warm.

437
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,080
I’m afraid

438
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
your heart is on fire.

439
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
It’s been a long and tiring journey,

440
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,320
Miss Chong.

441
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,720
Wuming will take

442
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,200
you to your room.

443
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,040
OK.

444
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,240
Wuming.

445
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,400
Miss Chong.

446
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
This way, please.

447
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,680
The rejuvenation spell Miss Chong cast on you

448
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,880
works well.

449
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,160
Oh, Mr. Yin.

450
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,560
Please don’t tell her the truth

451
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,920
about my health condition.

452
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
I don’t want Moon Valley to become

453
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
a place that distresses her.

454
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,890
I want her to feel different

455
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
when she’s in Moon Valley.

456
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
I want her to be carefree.

457
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
You fool.

458
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,480
I am.

459
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,400
How come there’s a room for girls

460
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,280
in Moon Valley.

461
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,720
Because

462
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,160
I prepared it just for you.

463
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
For me?

464
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
You knew I was coming?

465
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,810
I wished you could come,

466
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
and I kept waiting

467
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
for the day you come.

468
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,100
Master Shangguan.

469
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,280
I’ll start imparting

470
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,440
you Lotus Sutra tomorrow.

471
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
Please make sure

472
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,040
the cultivation room

473
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,640
is quiet and placid.

474
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
What’s with your smile?

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,240
I mean it.

476
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,620
I smile because

477
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,280
when you’re arranging things,

478
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,680
you look more like a leader

479
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,760
than I do.

480
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,880
The key to practicing Lotus Sutra

481
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,400
seems simple,

482
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,600
but it’s hard in practice.

483
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
If you don’t focus,

484
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
your inner power can’t be improved,

485
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,400
and the vital energy will impact your guts.

486
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,640
Miss Chong.

487
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,840
What?

488
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,720
What we’re doing here

489
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,600
reminds me of the past.

490
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,240
Hadn’t you given me all of your inner power,

491
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,900
I wouldn’t have achieved Lotus Wing.

492
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,560
Stay calm. Focus on lotus.

493
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,120
Heart and mind become one. Keep placid.

494
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,160
Nothing to abandon. No desire, no ego.

495
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,400
It’s remarkable

496
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,800
you’ve reached this level of mind.

497
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,120
During my practice,

498
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,160
I wanted a breakthrough,

499
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,210
but I never got the happiness of achievement.

500
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,400
I think

501
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
there’s a long way ahead of me

502
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,400
to achieve the ninth move.

503
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,520
So if you transfuse the vital energy to me,

504
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,320
you...

505
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
Don’t worry about it.

506
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,080
Focus.

507
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,920
Hold the vital energy.

508
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,420
Master Shangguan,

509
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,780
time for medicine.

510
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,760
It’s hot.

511
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,560
You’ve been practicing

512
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,880
Lotus Sutra for days.

513
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,480
Why do you still look ill?

514
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,400
Are you ok?

515
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,560
I’m fine.

516
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,000
Don’t worry about me.

517
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
It’s been tiring for you

518
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,920
to impart me during the daytime

519
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,480
while doing medical research

520
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,400
with Mr. Yin in the evening.

521
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,800
Thank you.

522
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,240
Miss Chong,

523
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,900
if you find the valley agreeable,

524
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,240
why don’t you

525
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,440
stick around for a while longer.

526
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,160
There’s an expanse of flowers on the hill.

527
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,490
It’s really beautiful.

528
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,920
I can take you there.

529
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,980
Master Shangguan,

530
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
do you remember

531
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,360
what you said to me

532
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,880
before the Weapon Ranking Convention?

533
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
I, Shangguan Tou,

534
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,320
has no love

535
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,680
or desire

536
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
for you.

537
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,120
I apologize

538
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,920
if I said or did

539
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
something wrong.

540
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,680
Yes.

541
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
I remember every word I said.

542
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,840
But

543
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,600
the reason I said that

544
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,980
was because my life experience bothered me.

545
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,800
I couldn’t open my heart to anyone.

546
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,610
But now it’s different.

547
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,340
I have changed.

548
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,820
I’m willing to learn how to love someone.

549
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,800
But

550
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,560
do you know how sad I felt?

551
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,160
Sorry

552
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,000
that I chose to let you go.

553
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,320
But do you know

554
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,200
ever since then,

555
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,380
I couldn’t get the moments we spent together

556
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,480
off my mind.

557
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,160
The only thing I could do

558
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,300
was keep the lovesickness at the bottom of my heart.

559
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Since we met in Peace County,

560
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
I could no longer

561
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
hold in my feelings for you.

562
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,600
Miss Chong,

563
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,760
I know

564
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,290
you still have feelings for me,

565
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,320
right?

566
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
Master Shangguan,

567
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,720
do you still remember

568
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,410
that I once said we were different?

569
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,000
You know,

570
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,000
I’m always scared.

571
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
I’m scared that

572
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,440
someday, you wouldn’t put with
my bad reputation,

573
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
that you’d leave me.

574
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,240
There’s so much weight on me.

575
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,480
I need to pay all the debts of blood

576
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,160
that my dad left.

577
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,760
Do you think

578
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
I’d have the heart

579
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,940
to see you being pointed at

580
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,440
or judged?

581
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,840
If you say so,

582
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,200
I can tell you that

583
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,960
I’m judged

584
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,280
or slandered

585
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,960
no less than you are.

586
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,720
You know,

587
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,880
people on the streets

588
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
call me a playboy.

589
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,480
Well,

590
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,970
why don’t we partner up?

591
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,680
So that

592
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,090
there’s less threat for the world.

593
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,480
Partner up?

594
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,120
Less threat?

595
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,960
Aren’t you worried that

596
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,200
I’ll turn the Hall of Flames into a cult

597
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,410
and your life will be in danger?

598
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,880
If you turn the Hall of Flames into a cult

599
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
and become a monster,

600
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,240
I’d go to hell with you.

601
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,760
OK.

602
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,760
Then you need to practice harder

603
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,840
so that you won’t fail me.

604
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,160
I’ll need you

605
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,240
to protect me.

606
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
It would be an honor.

607
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,500
[Hall of Flames]

608
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,880
What?

609
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,200
Let me see.

610
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
You’re bleeding.

611
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,520
Are you hurt?

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,800
I’m ok.

613
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,940
What are you doing?

614
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,360
Zhusha, what are you doing here?

615
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,080
I...

616
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,120
I’m helping him make weapons.

617
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,540
This dummy knows how to make a weapon?

618
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,710
Chequ is ingenious.

619
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Apart from weapon-making,

620
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,710
he can cook, build furniture, and make ceramics.

621
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,670
He can do everything.

622
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,480
Unlike you,

623
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,739
all you do is idle about and make trouble.

624
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,560
Zhusha,

625
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,880
come here, I have something to tell you.

626
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,670
What?

627
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,840
Come here.

628
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,000
What?

629
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,760
Louder.

630
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,710
Nothing.

631
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,200
Weirdo.

632
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,600
Hey, dummy.

633
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,880
Do you like Zhusha?

634
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,560
What are you talking about?

635
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,820
Why are you so nervous?

636
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Looks like it’s true.

637
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,520
You grew up together.

638
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,800
You are close.

639
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,240
You haven’t shown her your love?

640
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,920
Why?

641
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,840
Because I...

642
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,560
Does it have anything to do with you?

643
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,240
No.

644
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,640
Tell me about it.

645
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,160
Shoo!

646
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,160
Fine.

647
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,640
You don’t want to tell me?

648
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,130
I’ll go find Zhusha.

649
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,840
Look at you, Zhusha.

650
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
You’re pretty.

651
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,800
You do housework.

652
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,320
How wifely of you!

653
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,000
What’s your problem?

654
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,880
I’m just wondering

655
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,410
what you think of

656
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,680
Chequ.

657
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,900
Why do you ask this?

658
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,400
I’m curious.

659
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,800
You two grew up together.

660
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,240
Haven’t you got any feelings

661
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,520
for him?

662
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,450
What feelings would I have for him?

663
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,560
The guy

664
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,640
is like dummy.

665
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,360
All he does every day

666
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,800
is fiddle with those iron bars and wood blocks.

667
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,060
He knows nothing else.

668
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,160
He can’t wash or sew

669
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,240
his clothes.

670
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,360
And he says something

671
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,690
that pisses people off.

672
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,680
But

673
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,900
despite all of his shortcomings,

674
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
he is overall

675
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
a good person.

676
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,720
Good how?

677
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,160
He seems dumb

678
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,120
and dull,

679
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,160
but he’s very honest.

680
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,040
And you know what?

681
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,940
He’s the best craftsman here.

682
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,160
But he never gets complacent,

683
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,890
instead, he helps people a lot.

684
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,400
Done.

685
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,960
What’s done?

686
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,200
You and Zhusha.

687
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,000
No.

688
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,880
I asked her for you.

689
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,480
Zhusha

690
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
thinks you’re a good man.

691
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,120
It’s just...

692
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,400
Just what?

693
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,160
She also thinks you’re dumb and dull.

694
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,220
That you don’t say nice things to her.

695
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,210
What should I do?

696
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,480
To make a girl happy,

697
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,940
you need to send her gifts.

698
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Do you have money?

699
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,480
I do.

700
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,320
Give me the money,

701
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,200
I’ll go buy a gift for you to give Zhusha.

702
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
She’ll be very happy.

703
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,680
Thanks but no,

704
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,000
it’s my own business.

705
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,520
Come on!

706
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,920
I’ll handle it for you.

707
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560
I’m off.

708
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,850
Master Shangguan pretends to be cool,

709
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,480
but every midnight,

710
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,080
the all-over spasm gives him extreme agony.

711
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,600
He often has trouble sleeping,

712
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,330
which has lasted for many days.

713
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
He told me that

714
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,720
at the beginning of the cultivation,

715
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,050
a maladjustment of inner breath happens.

716
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,540
He told me not to say a word.

717
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,480
But

718
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,160
I know him too well.

719
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,440
He won’t say it

720
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,900
until the last minute.

721
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,770
Can’t believe we have such a patient here.

722
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,840
This, to me, is an insult.

723
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,400
It’s unacceptable!

724
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
Calm down, Mr. Yin.

725
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,600
The top priority now

726
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,800
is to find

727
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,040
a remission method.

728
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,560
This is serious.

729
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,290
Do you have a remission method?

730
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I’m afraid

731
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,440
it’s but a palliative.

732
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,800
I now

733
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,000
impart Lotus Sutra to him every day.

734
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,560
It’s supposed

735
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,240
to treat his inner injury

736
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,080
very effectively.

737
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,080
After all, our leader

738
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,240
is the first one whose

739
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,800
inner injury is treated with Lotus Sutra.

740
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,060
There’s no previous case for reference.

741
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
It’s possible that

742
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,960
he has unexpected symptoms.

743
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,720
But,

744
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,240
his inner breath is weak.

745
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,080
Blind impartation

746
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
may over-accelerate the recovery.

747
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
What do we do then?

748
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,880
From the perspective of five elements,

749
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,940
there’s too much vital energy in him.

750
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,810
Water might solve the problem.

751
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,610
Medicine advances transfusion and potency.

752
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,140
This is the only way

753
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,240
at this point.

754
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,300
[Pavilion of Breeze]

755
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,520
Miss Chong,

756
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,080
is that you?

757
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,040
Yes.

758
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,160
Are you ready?

759
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,840
I am.

760
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,160
Let’s begin.
