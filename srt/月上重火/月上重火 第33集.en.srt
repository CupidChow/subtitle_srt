[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 33

4
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,510
But Imperial Guards

5
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,080
did find weapons and armors

6
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,360
hidden by the Hall of Flames

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
in Imperial Advisor’s Mansion.

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,030
If you can provide

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,670
the evidence to deny the accusation,

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
I can plead with my father for his pardon.

11
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,440
Alright.

12
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,960
I’m going to the palace now

13
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,960
to see my father,

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,720
hoping he can show mercy.

15
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,829
But you’d better get prepared mentally.

16
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,960
The chance of amnesty

17
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,910
is slim.

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

19
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
Don’t leave here

20
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,630
until you get my message.

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,160
Master Shangguan.

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,390
Why not tell His Highness the truth?

23
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,470
I have no idea if he is trustworthy.

24
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,550
If

25
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,630
his intention is the same as Lord Lu's,

26
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,030
the accusation to my family will be undeniable.

27
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,800
Since you have doubts,

28
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,110
why are you still here?

29
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,190
I'm waiting for his reply.

30
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,110
If he really pleads with His Majesty,

31
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
it means Crown Prince has nothing to do with it.

32
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,360
What if

33
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,390
he wouldn’t?

34
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,320
Then we’ll have to fight it out.

35
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,000
Zheng.

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I know you’re worried about your father.

37
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,270
If he is truly framed,

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,440
I will

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
definitely clear his name.

40
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,110
If?

41
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,079
Isn’t it clear enough?

42
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,470
Zheng.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,829
I know Imperial Advisor would never rebel.

44
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,630
But without evidence,

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,600
how can I prove his innocence?

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Right?

47
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,720
Zheng.

48
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,829
What are you doing?

49
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,440
Xue Lie.

50
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,030
You’re Lord Lu.

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
A prince.

52
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,630
I’m your wife.

53
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,910
Now I am

54
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,080
begging you as the daughter of Shangguan

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,350
to save our family.

56
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,390
Zheng.

57
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,269
I’ll do what you say.

58
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,510
Rise first.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,270
Rise.

60
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Zheng.

61
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,880
I know you’re worried about Imperial Advisor.

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,950
It also concerns all the lives

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,070
of Shangguan family.

64
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,790
Thus,

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,230
I’m going to Dongdu right now

66
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,720
to look into it personally

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
and clear your father’s name.

68
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,230
Trust me.

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
I will surely clear his name.

70
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,390
Rest assured.

71
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,480
Chief Guardian.

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,880
You...

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,480
You’re here.

74
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,830
Any news from the Hall of Flames?

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,720
Not just the Hall of Flames.

76
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,920
Imperial Advisor’s Mansion is in trouble, too.

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,040
What happened to it?

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,790
It’s said Imperial Guards

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,040
found the blades

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,950
forged

81
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,320
by your sect in the Imperial Advisor’s Mansion.

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
They were caught red-handed.

83
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,790
Imperial Advisor

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,950
has been imprisoned.

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,230
Master Shangguan

86
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,830
is missing, too.

87
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,950
Xuezhi.

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,270
Chief Guardian.

89
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,760
Please listen to me.

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
I don’t think this thing

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,350
is against the Hall of Flames.

92
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,790
If you go rashly,

93
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,390
it may cause a big trouble

94
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,640
to the Hall of Flames.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,350
If Xuezhi goes to Shangguan Tou,

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,760
she’ll go through Dongdu to Moon Valley.

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,270
Although Shangguan Tou is on the run,

98
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,480
Mr. Lin is in the Valley.

99
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,270
He will surely take good care of Xuezhi.

100
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
If I go there recklessly,

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,320
the enemies will be alerted.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,230
I’d better wait and see.

103
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,040
You have a point.

104
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,040
The Leader will leave

105
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,550
for some days.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,670
During the period,

107
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,920
please help me

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
ask for the information about the Leader.

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
No problem.

110
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,390
I’ll go right now.

111
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,000
Given Imperial Advisor’s contributions
to the court,

112
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,160
father decided to

113
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,320
spare Shangguan family from the implication,

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,390
yet Imperial Advisor’s death penalty

115
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,390
will not be spared.

116
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
This is my father’s decree.

117
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,440
Imperial Guards have withdrawn.

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,790
You are safe

119
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,350
to leave anytime.

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,230
I appreciate it, Your Highness.

121
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,510
I’ll engrave your kindness

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
in my mind.

123
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,670
I’ll surely pay you back in the future.

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,600
It’s a shame

125
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,920
that I failed to convince my father.

126
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,920
Shangguan Tou.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,950
If Imperial Advisor is truly wronged,

128
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,040
I hope you can get the evidence ASAP

129
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
to prove his innocence.

130
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,070
Perhaps

131
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,760
his life can still be saved.

132
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,760
I’m afraid

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,000
the one who framed my father

134
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,350
has destroyed all the evidences.

135
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,720
What are you going to do?

136
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,270
You are on your own.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,670
Can you turn it around?

138
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,550
I’m all alone,

139
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,950
but I will never give up.

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,950
If you need,

141
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,159
I can help you.

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,040
Your Highness.

143
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,270
You've done more than enough for me.

144
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,070
Moreover,

145
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,320
the accusation of rebellion is huge.

146
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,270
If you interfere,

147
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,640
I’m afraid you’ll be implicated.

148
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,950
I know

149
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,390
you don’t want me to interfere in it.

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,110
But I’m willing to do my utmost

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,110
to clear Imperial Advisor’s name.

152
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,720
I am

153
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,720
the Crown Prince of the world.

154
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,720
I do not allow anyone

155
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,390
to play politics

156
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,480
in the court.

157
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,230
If anyone dares to use power for personal gains,

158
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,230
I will not let them off.

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,950
Your Highness.

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,830
You may

161
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,880
do me another favor.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,510
Father.

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
I’m not a good son.

164
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,710
Tou.

165
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,520
You did nothing wrong.

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,590
I got you into this.

167
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,909
Hadn’t you done it for me,

168
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,710
you wouldn’t be wronged and imprisoned.

169
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,280
Father.

170
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,840
You did this

171
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,230
to let me forgive you?

172
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,320
Father.

173
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,280
I forgave you long ago.

174
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,520
Tou.

175
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,670
What I did

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,080
wasn’t to let you forgive me.

177
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,840
I did it to forgive myself.

178
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,350
Hadn’t I done these things,

179
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,320
that girl could have died.

180
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,880
I had a dream last night.

181
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,080
I dreamed of your mother.

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I said to her

183
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,200
our son

184
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
was in love with a lovely girl.

185
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,710
Knowing it,

186
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,470
your mother felt relieved.

187
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,710
Father.

188
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,640
We may compromise.

189
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,400
I can’t watch you leave me like this.

190
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,590
I haven’t brought my love to see you yet.

191
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,350
I haven’t had your grandsons and let you

192
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,350
enjoy the bliss.

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,400
I cannot let you die like this.

194
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,230
Tou.

195
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,640
The saying has that

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,150
things don’t occur as you wish.

197
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,320
Ever since I became an officer,

198
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,710
I’ve been ready

199
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,440
to face an ending like this.

200
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Now you are also

201
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,470
in this game.

202
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,470
Don’t make any mistake.

203
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,350
Don’t withdraw a move due to your mistakes.

204
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,080
Otherwise, you’ll lose the whole game.

205
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,590
All of this...

206
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,400
All of this

207
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,080
had nothing to do with you originally.

208
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,080
How can I watch you bear all of these

209
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,960
in my stead?

210
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Tou.

211
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,320
You remind me of the time

212
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,710
when I was in love with your mother.

213
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,230
Back then,

214
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,710
I also thought about

215
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,960
doing anything

216
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,110
for...

217
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,910
for the one I loved.

218
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,790
But,

219
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,350
I failed to stick to my heart.

220
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,200
In front of power,

221
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,590
I chose to forsake love.

222
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,670
Now I just don’t hope

223
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,150
the tragedy of your mother and me

224
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,790
repeats on you again.

225
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,320
Father.

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,910
Tell me.

227
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,350
What should I do to get you out?

228
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,470
Don’t save me, Tou.

229
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,280
You’re supposed to

230
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,710
save

231
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,080
your crazy brother-in-law,

232
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,790
and save all the sects in the world.

233
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,670
Since the day

234
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,080
I sent you to the Sword Manor,

235
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,550
your life

236
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,320
has been bound to the entire martial arts world.

237
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,790
You can choose to elude.

238
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,350
But you are the one

239
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,550
who can stop Lord Lu

240
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,280
most likely.

241
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,550
I’m not stopping anyone.

242
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,150
Father.

243
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,150
I only want to get you out.

244
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,960
I have to get you out!

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,840
Tou!

246
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,880
Crown Prince

247
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,440
just asked for mercy for our family.

248
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,320
Do you want to get him in trouble?

249
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,710
You want me to watch you die

250
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,400
from the false accusation? Father!

251
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,760
But my death can save you and your sister!

252
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,640
Father!

253
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,030
Tou.

254
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,080
There is a long time to go ahead.

255
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,790
Tou.

256
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,320
Our family

257
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,150
cannot bear the stigma of rebellion forever.

258
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,710
If I run away today,

259
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,230
the guilt of rebellion will be undeniable,

260
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,400
and Lord Lu will

261
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,280
have his way.

262
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,910
Think about it.

263
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,640
If the court starts a war

264
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,590
with the sects,

265
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,080
that will be a catastrophe.

266
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,670
Between me and the whole world,

267
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,400
Tou,

268
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,670
you have to make a choice.

269
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,440
I don’t care about justice

270
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,440
or the world.

271
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,350
I don’t care.

272
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,640
I just hope

273
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,880
those whom I love

274
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,590
can live in peace.

275
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,150
Tou,

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,960
I know you’re a good son.

277
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,200
But I’d rather

278
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,910
you could live well for me.

279
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,440
All people will die.

280
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,470
Family

281
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,790
will also part.

282
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,960
Everything in the world

283
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,080
has their destiny.

284
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,230
Don’t regret.

285
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,080
Don’t dwell on the past.

286
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,400
Finish what you are doing.

287
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,000
Let go of all the feuds

288
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,760
and have a good life.

289
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,580
[Prison]

290
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,590
Open the door.

291
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,640
Yes.

292
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,440
Your Highness.

293
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,640
You come sooner than I thought.

294
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,880
Since you knew I’d come,

295
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,280
I believe you know

296
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,550
why I’m here.

297
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,640
I’m afraid I can’t do anything

298
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,880
for what you want.

299
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,640
Imperial Advisor.

300
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,320
You are

301
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,470
making it hard on me.

302
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,840
Whether hard or not,

303
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,320
I’m sure you already

304
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,710
made your decision in your mind.

305
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,280
Imperial Advisor.

306
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,840
You are loyal and patriotic.

307
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,200
But why are you

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,590
always involved in the affairs of the sects?

309
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,080
Your son is

310
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,640
always against me.

311
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,670
If you

312
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,080
help me persuade your son

313
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,520
not to be hostile to me,

314
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,110
your name

315
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,790
can be cleared.

316
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,440
Sorry, but I can’t help, Your Highness.

317
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,349
You don’t know, Imperial Advisor.

318
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,069
In a few days,

319
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,230
it’ll be the night of full noon.

320
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,160
Don’t you

321
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,280
want to get out of this dark cage,

322
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,760
reunite with your family

323
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,760
and enjoy the full moon with them?

324
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,560
I am contented with my life.

325
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,470
I’m no longer

326
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,190
lingering on this mundane world.

327
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,350
However,

328
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,830
I have to advise you

329
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,400
that the court is not like the sects.

330
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,000
The people of the sects

331
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,920
are not as kind as those in the court.

332
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,350
The saying has that

333
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,920
the wrath of commoners

334
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
is like a comet striking the moon

335
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,230
and the white rainbow goes across the sun.

336
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,230
The people of the sects

337
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,400
Live by chivalry and valor,

338
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,590
whose energy is way beyond

339
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,070
our imagination.

340
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
You don’t have to worry about

341
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
my safety.

342
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,230
Anyone who offends me

343
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,280
will

344
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,350
end up

345
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,640
with death.

346
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,190
Your Highness.

347
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,950
I only have one request.

348
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,590
Please don't hurt Zheng.

349
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,310
She has nothing to do with politics.

350
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,590
Rest assured.

351
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,000
Zheng is

352
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
my wife.

353
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,950
I will protect her for sure.

354
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,230
Close the door.

355
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,590
Mr. Lin!

356
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,680
Mr. Lin!

357
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,310
Lin…

358
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,590
Xuezhi.

359
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,560
I've known it.

360
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,760
Why did you lie to me?

361
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,160
How come you’re here?

362
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,400
I met Yuan Shuangshuang.

363
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,880
She told me everything that happened back then.

364
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,680
She set you up

365
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,520
and forced you to leave the Sword Manor.

366
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,830
Why didn’t you tell me?

367
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,800
Why didn’t you explain anything to me?

368
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,280
That's because

369
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,800
there’s no need to explain.

370
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,160
Do you want me

371
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,880
to mistake it forever?

372
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,470
Since we’re meant to part,

373
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,520
it’s unnecessary

374
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,040
to explain it.

375
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,920
It doesn’t matter to misunderstand me.

376
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,430
What do you mean?

377
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,430
I mean

378
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,400
I loved you with my true heart.

379
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,110
What about you?

380
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You’d rather believe

381
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,520
the rumors which didn’t exist.

382
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,230
You didn’t trust me, either.

383
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,350
Do you really love me?

384
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,280
Or

385
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,830
you love my family background?

386
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,880
Otherwise,

387
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,470
how come a small misunderstanding

388
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,680
could tear us apart?

389
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,880
If our relationship is so fragile,

390
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,710
I’d rather not have it.

391
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,830
Do you know what you are saying?

392
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,640
Haven’t I made it clear?

393
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,190
Chong Xuezhi.

394
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,400
I did so much for you.

395
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,110
All I got in return was your leaving.

396
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
If it were you,

397
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,680
would you still hold on to this relationship?

398
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,760
Miss Chong.

399
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,350
To be blunt,

400
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,800
I forgot you long time ago.

401
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,800
Because it’s impossible for us

402
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
to be together.

403
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,680
You're lying.

404
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,640
You did so much for me.

405
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,040
Now you say you don’t love me.

406
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,070
You think I believe it?

407
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,760
Looks like you’ve heard of something else.

408
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,680
I know you went to Huashan and saved me.

409
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,710
I know the Hall of Flames

410
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,640
was framed by villains,

411
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,160
and you freed Muyuan and me

412
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,470
from the military penalty.

413
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,070
You did so much for me.

414
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,400
You say you don’t love me.

415
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,640
You think I believe it?

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,160
It seems

417
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,680
you’ve really been

418
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,950
spoiled by the Hall of Flames since little,

419
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,710
and think everyone should listen to you.

420
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,110
Right.

421
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,310
I did save you in Huashan.

422
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,000
That’s because I loathed Feng Cheng,

423
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,110
the hypocrite who advocated

424
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,310
he was

425
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,830
devoted to the justice of the world.

426
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,070
As for the closure of the Hall of Flames,

427
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,190
saving you

428
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,310
and Muyuan

429
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,880
was just lifting a finger.

430
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,800
I

431
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,400
am not

432
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
that affectionate,

433
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,110
but I’m a decent man at least.

434
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,280
Saving you

435
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,520
is to tell people of other sects

436
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,920
that as long as the sects are in danger,

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,830
I will do what I can

438
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
to help them  when they need.

439
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,430
Miss Chong.

440
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,350
You’re really over thinking.

441
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,640
Alright.

442
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,520
Do you dare to say

443
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,430
all you did wasn’t for me?

444
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,710
Do you dare to say

445
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,280
you’ve never ever

446
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,160
loved me since the very beginning?

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
Please leave.

448
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,350
By the way,

449
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,710
from now on,

450
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,830
don’t let me hear

451
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,950
any gossips about you and me.

452
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,110
Don’t you leave?

453
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,110
You want me to send you away?

454
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,950
No need.

455
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,920
I know the way.

456
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,520
Now that you say you don't love me anymore,

457
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,520
I’ll go far away,

458
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,000
so that you’ll never find me

459
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,230
and no one will hurt me again.

460
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,400
Why did you lie to her?

461
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,560
She doesn’t know about you,

462
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,950
but I do.

463
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,160
To save Xuezhi,

464
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,640
you exhausted your inner energy.

465
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,520
In Huashan,

466
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,160
you nearly got killed to save her.

467
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,830
You obviously love her,

468
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,560
yet you said those words to hurt her.

469
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,400
Tou.

470
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,350
Are you hiding anything from me?

471
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,310
Master Shangguan.

472
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,880
Everything is ready.

473
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,950
We can set off anytime.

474
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:40,760
Wuming.

475
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,760
Wait for me outside with them.

476
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,760
Yes.

477
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,920
You are...

478
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,310
Mr. Lin.

479
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,520
My father was

480
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
framed by Xue Lie for rebellion.

481
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
He is in jail now.

482
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,560
His Majesty ordered

483
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,190
to execute him in two days.

484
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,560
How come?

485
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,640
No.

486
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,310
I’m going to His Majesty.

487
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,760
I’m his brother.

488
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
I believe he’ll show mercy

489
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,520
for my sake,

490
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,280
and re-investigate it.

491
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,350
Mr. Lin.

492
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,710
It’s no use.

493
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,800
According to the law,

494
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,800
all my family

495
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
should be executed.

496
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,640
It’s Crown Prince

497
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,190
who pleaded with His Majesty

498
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,640
to change the judgment

499
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,920
into killing him only

500
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,400
so that my family could be saved.

501
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,470
There are too many doubts on it.

502
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,190
The judgment shall not be made rashly.

503
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,830
A rebellion

504
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
can overthrow the state,

505
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,920
which won’t be tolerated

506
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,400
even by the wisest emperor.

507
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,830
Even he is slightly suspicious of it,

508
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,470
he’ll get it to the bottom.

509
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,470
Even killing the innocents by mistake,

510
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,710
he will not let any rebel go away.

511
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,680
Will you rescue him from the execution ground
with them?

512
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,350
That's my father.

513
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,190
I can’t

514
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,230
watch him die from false accusation.

515
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,430
Tou,

516
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,190
rescuing him there is a death penalty!

517
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,710
I know.

518
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,880
But I am his son.

519
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,950
I have no way

520
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,640
to watch my father die for no reason.

521
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,000
This time,

522
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,560
I will go

523
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,470
even if I have to die.

524
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,350
Alright, Mr. Lin.

525
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,520
Don’t try to persuade me.

526
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,950
I’ve made up my mind.

527
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,400
Hadn’t you determined

528
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,470
to die for it,

529
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,040
you wouldn’t have said the hard words to Xuezhi.

530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,800
Mr. Lin.

531
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,800
This time,

532
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,950
if anything really goes wrong,

533
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,000
please take good care of Xuezhi.

534
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:06,830
Zheng.

535
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,430
Xue Lie!

536
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,520
How is it?

537
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,110
Did His Majesty withdraw the decree?

538
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,280
Crown Prince pleaded with His Majesty.

539
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,680
Shangguan family was spared of death penalty.

540
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,560
Really?

541
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,710
That’s great!

542
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,590
Did His Majesty say

543
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,110
when my father will be released?

544
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,520
Tell me.

545
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,830
When will father be released?

546
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,190
His Majesty

547
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,000
spared Shangguan family’s death penalty,

548
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,520
but...

549
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,110
But what?

550
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,880
Say it.

551
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,160
But Imperial Advisor’s death penalty

552
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,190
isn’t exempted.

553
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,640
Zheng.

554
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:49,920
Zheng.

555
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,520
Xue Lie.

556
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,710
I want to see my father the last time.

557
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,160
Can you help me?

558
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,110
Sure.

559
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,310
I’ll listen to you.

560
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,160
Go back to rest now.

561
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
We're going there tomorrow morning.

562
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,680
I can’t wait until tomorrow!

563
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,040
Alright.

564
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,880
Let’s go now.

565
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,040
Right now.

566
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,590
Sure.

567
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,190
I’ll do whatever you say.

568
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,400
We're going now.

569
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,710
Leader.

570
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:28,950
Master Shangguan.

571
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,800
We’ve checked out around.

572
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,710
There are three exits here.

573
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,070
Tomorrow

574
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,310
there must be tons of Imperial Guards here.

575
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,350
If we save Imperial Advisor from here,

576
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,230
it will be a fierce battle definitely.

577
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,590
In tomorrow’s battle,

578
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,920
I just want to save my father.

579
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,350
Don’t hurt the innocent.

580
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,680
-Yes.
-Yes.

581
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,040
Shangguan Tou.

582
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,950
Wuming.

583
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Leave us alone.

584
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,430
How come you are here?

585
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
A coincidence, maybe.

586
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,880
But I have something to ask you.

587
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,110
The execution ground is to execute felons.

588
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,950
How come you’re here?

589
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,710
It has nothing to do with you,

590
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,520
Miss Chong.

591
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,310
Stop hiding it from me.

592
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,880
I heard what you said just now.

593
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,110
You meant to save your father.

594
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,000
But you’re afraid to get me in danger.

595
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,470
So, in Moon Valley,

596
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,350
you turned me down coldly.

597
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,230
You kept me in the dark more than once.

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,830
At this moment,

599
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,230
you still keep it from me?

600
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,310
It’s my own business.

601
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,520
You don’t have to worry about it.

602
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,560
Alright.

603
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,710
Since you don’t tell me,

604
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,000
I won’t force you.

605
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
I’ll follow you.

606
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,350
Tomorrow,

607
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,680
there will be a result.

608
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,800
No.

609
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,680
It’ll be extremely dangerous tomorrow.

610
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,040
You can’t stay here.

611
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,400
Tou.

612
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,920
You saved me so many times.

613
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,640
It’s my turn to back you up.

614
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,000
Xuezhi.

615
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,160
Those that we used to fight were the sects.

616
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,230
It’s different this time.

617
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,950
-This time we’re going to fight...
-If anything else,

618
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,520
we may talk after your father is saved.

619
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,520
Xuezhi.

620
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,590
Tou.

621
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,430
We’ve been through

622
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,160
so many things

623
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,560
and so many misunderstandings.

624
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,070
If

625
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,070
we are predestined to die together,

626
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
I hope,

627
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,310
at least before death,

628
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,830
we can be honest with each other.

629
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,800
So, I only have one question now.

630
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,230
When we were in Moon Valley,

631
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,040
you said you didn’t love me anymore.

632
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,280
Is it true?

633
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,190
Xuezhi.

634
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,880
I thought

635
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,680
I’d never see you again in this life.

636
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,040
Promise me.

637
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,310
From today on,

638
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,190
don’t leave me again.

639
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,400
I promise you.

640
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,230
-Open it!
-Open the door.

641
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,680
Zheng.

642
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,160
Father!

643
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,710
Zheng.

644
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,640
Father, how are you?

645
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:09,429
Zheng.

646
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,670
Zheng, why are you here?

647
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,150
You shouldn’t come, Zheng.

648
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,150
What happened to you?

649
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,389
What did they do to you, father?

650
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,150
Zheng.

651
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,360
I’m fine.

652
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,469
It’s my bad.

653
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,230
I got you

654
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,429
worry about me.

655
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,429
Don’t cry.

656
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,800
Zheng.

657
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,360
What's wrong, Zheng?

658
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,870
Father.

659
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,560
I’m pregnant.

660
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,909
You...

661
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,360
Does His Highness know it?

662
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,190
I haven't told him yet.

663
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,040
Zheng.

664
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,320
Anyway,

665
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,910
he is the father of the child.

666
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,150
You should let him know.

667
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,560
Father.

668
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,470
Tell me.

669
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,390
Who on earth would frame you?

670
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,800
Zheng.

671
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,390
It doesn't matter who it is.

672
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,950
I’ve realized long ago

673
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,430
that I’d end up like this.

674
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,710
Father.

675
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,000
I know a thing or two even if you don't tell me.

676
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,360
I know you have a beef with Xue Lie.

677
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,760
Is there any misunderstanding between you two?

678
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,280
I’ll go beg Xue Lie

679
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,320
and let him plead with His Majesty.

680
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,360
His Majesty will surely acquit you.

681
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,000
Zheng!

682
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,520
Zheng.

683
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,230
These things

684
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,430
are not as simple as you think.

685
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,870
Father.

686
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,040
I don’t understand.

687
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,840
Zheng.

688
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,710
Lord Lu and I

689
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,320
have been fighting for years

690
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,040
due to political disagreements.

691
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,870
I didn’t want you to marry him back then.

692
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,800
But you were so silly

693
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,000
and said

694
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,910
you only loved him

695
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,800
and would only marry him.

696
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,390
Father.

697
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,430
It’s my fault.

698
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,390
It’s my fault.

699
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,910
Zheng.

700
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,150
Zheng, you shouldn’t blame yourself.

701
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,800
Xue Lie and I

702
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
have never been on the same side.

703
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,150
But I know

704
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
he truly loves you.

705
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,600
You didn’t see him wrong.

706
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,520
Zheng.

707
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,390
You must keep it in mind

708
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
that he is your husband,

709
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,230
the father of your child.

710
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,760
Whenever it is,

711
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,470
the politics have nothing to do with you.

712
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,560
Zheng.

713
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,840
I’m afraid

714
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,430
I can’t see the baby to be born.

715
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,000
But you must remember,

716
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,670
for this child,

717
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,390
do not do anything stupid.

718
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,390
Besides,

719
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,150
take good care of Tou.

720
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,870
He has been traveling in the world these years,

721
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,000
but he is always concerned about our family.

722
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,870
He knows I’m leaving.

723
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,470
He can’t accept it for sure.

724
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,840
No matter what,

725
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you must stop him

726
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,670
from seeking avenge for me, Zheng.

727
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,520
You must tell him

728
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,760
to let go of the court,

729
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,670
the sects

730
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,630
and the feuds,

731
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,430
to live a happy life.

732
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,430
Father!

733
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,670
Zheng.

734
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,190
I don’t want you to die.

735
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,320
No!

736
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,150
Zheng.

737
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,150
Father!

738
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,040
Sir.

739
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,630
It's about the time.

740
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,470
Drink the wine

741
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,150
and go on your way.

742
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,230
No!

743
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,870
No!

744
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,870
No!

745
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,040
Go!

746
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,470
-Go with me!
-Zheng!

747
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:03,670
-Father!
-Go away!

748
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,390
Don’t leave!

749
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,870
-Zheng!
-Father!

750
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,800
-Go!
-Go!

751
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,320
Zheng!

752
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,000
-No!
-Zheng!

753
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,630
Zheng!

754
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,600
Father!

755
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,950
Zheng! Zheng!

756
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,710
Remember what I said!

757
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,320
Go!

758
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,320
No!

759
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Zheng.

760
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,360
Zheng.

761
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,470
How come?

762
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,760
How could it be like this?

763
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,760
Move!

764
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,500
[Prison]

765
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,320
Your Highness.

766
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,280
How is the preparation going?

767
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,670
All set, Your Highness.

768
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
Shangguan Tou.

769
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,800
It’s been a long time,

770
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,000
yet you have no progress on your game skills.

771
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,630
Every move you take

772
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,080
is in my expectation.

773
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,390
Shangguan Tou.

774
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,390
Stop wasting your time.

775
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,390
Imperial Advisor has taken

776
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,950
another way to the execution ground.

777
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,360
Xue Lie.

778
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,950
Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?

779
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,230
Now that I come in person,

780
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,120
I’ve gotten everything well prepared.

781
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,430
You cannot

782
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,840
save your father today.

783
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,360
So, I come to help you

784
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,630
reunite with him

785
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,280
in the underworld.

786
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,800
Master Shangguan.

787
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,670
We’ll cover you and Miss Chong to leave.

788
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,080
Xuezhi!

789
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,600
It’s magic!
