00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 10

4
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,470
Wild chervil

5
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,829
is good for the spleen,

6
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,170
which can promote blood circulation
to arrest pain.

7
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,880
Agastache rugosa,

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
can remove inner heat.

9
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,910
Trepang.

10
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,390
Agastache rugosa.

11
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,970
Please bring this to Mr. Shangguan

12
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,720
for me.

13
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,670
This is...

14
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
This is herbal tea.

15
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,550
Tell him this is made

16
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,790
by me

17
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,720
if he asks.

18
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,040
Go now.

19
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,620
Mr. Shangguan.

20
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,860
Mr. Shangguan.

21
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,270
What is this?

22
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,600
This

23
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,480
is made by Ms. Chong.

24
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Put it away.

25
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,920
Bring it away.

26
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,670
Yes.

27
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,230
Mr. Lin.

28
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,480
I thought you went to visit Ms. Chong.

29
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,510
Why are you here?

30
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
What? Have you become an immortal?

31
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,880
Can’t I be here?

32
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
You know I don’t mean that.

33
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,200
Tou.

34
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,980
Do you know what do I like the most
about the Moon Valley?

35
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,200
I like the fine weather, the fresh air,

36
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,830
the bright moon and the breeze here.

37
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,720
What a pity.

38
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,670
They are all ruined.

39
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,050
What do you mean by that?

40
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,790
You should look at yourself in a mirror.

41
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,790
Look how twisted your eye brows are.

42
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,230
You’re making fun of me.

43
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,200
Why don’t you drink the tea Xuezhi made for you?

44
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,970
That’s not true.

45
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,720
You tasted it

46
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,230
but didn’t drink it.

47
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,480
The tea made by Ms. Chong

48
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,440
tastes

49
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,240
very unique.

50
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,390
Not everyone

51
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,640
in this world

52
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,520
can taste the tea made by Xuezhi.

53
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,720
I can’t take the tea

54
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,390
made by Ms. Chong.

55
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,350
Do you mean the tea becomes different

56
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,080
because of the one who makes it?

57
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,720
Tea is all the same.

58
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,070
But you can’t force me to take it.

59
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,480
Xuezhi is still young.

60
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,480
Everyone tries to kill her,

61
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,160
so it’ll be hard for her.

62
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,930
The reason why I entrust her
to you is that,

63
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,320
firstly,

64
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,070
I think you’re

65
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,390
reliable and upright.

66
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,830
Secondly,

67
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,760
I’m a coward

68
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,550
and dare not to get myself involved

69
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,950
in troubles in the world.

70
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,550
I know.

71
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,480
You have your own reasons.

72
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,550
This time, Ms. Chong was nearly assassinated.

73
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,010
And he intends to kill her.

74
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,600
I’ve asked Wuming to investigate it.

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Please rest assured.

76
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,050
You don’t know that.

77
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,070
That’s not like you.

78
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,650
I am different from you.

79
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,720
You’re experienced

80
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,040
and can withdraw yourself

81
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
whenever you like.

82
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,920
I’m different.

83
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,440
I have burdens from my clan.

84
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
I am caged by fame

85
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,390
and the heaven would weep for me.

86
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,640
I’m all alone.

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,390
That’s why

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,130
I can’t take the tea.

89
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You made so much comments on the tea

90
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,000
just because it was made by Xuezhi.

91
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,150
Yes.

92
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,940
Ms. Chong misunderstands it.

93
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,940
I can’t take it.

94
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,030
Everyone knows it well

95
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,000
that Xuezhi’s father was obsessed
with martial arts.

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,400
He mastered martial arts

97
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
due to his obsession.

98
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,910
Xuezhi is like her father

99
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
while I suffer

100
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,230
from my being unwise.

101
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,550
Forget it.

102
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,590
It’s useless to talk too much.

103
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,400
Tou.

104
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,400
Xuezhi was brought here by you.

105
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,770
Although she and I were reunited,

106
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,440
I’m afraid that in her heart,

107
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,120
her family no longer exists.

108
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,120
You need to think carefully

109
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,680
where should her heart go

110
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,250
and where it is supposed to go.

111
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,550
But anyway,

112
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,940
I know you hope she’ll be all good.

113
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,080
Rest assured.

114
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,080
I know what to do.

115
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,200
Is it that awful?

116
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,320
Mr. Shangguan.

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,580
I was about to go to you.

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,670
Perfect timing.

119
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,070
I have something for you.

120
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,230
Come on in.

121
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,450
There is no need.

122
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,590
I’ll talk here.

123
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,470
This is your room.

124
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,670
It’s yours now

125
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
since I gave it to you.

126
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,450
We have boundaries.

127
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,760
What boundaries?

128
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,150
Boundaries between different genders?

129
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,030
Come on in.

130
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
What is it?

131
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,200
This is the Poison Immune Pill.

132
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,280
It it the precious pill

133
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,670
kept by Mr. Yin?

134
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
Right.

135
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,080
Ms. Chong.

136
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,440
Do you remember that Mr. Xia

137
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,570
who was poisoned at the Hero Assembly?

138
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
He was poisoned

139
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
by Man Feiyue

140
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,760
right after he drank the tea originally made for me

141
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,910
This matter

142
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,230
Is a reminder for you

143
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,760
that there are many vicious

144
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
and scheming people.

145
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
Moreover,

146
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,590
you have responsibilities.

147
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,670
It’s inevitable that people try to kill you.

148
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,150
You’ll be immune to all poisons

149
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,320
and toxic drugs

150
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,720
after you take this pill.

151
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,840
This is too precious.

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,880
I can’t take it.

153
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,470
I promised

154
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,770
that I will keep you safe and sound.

155
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,840
So,

156
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,670
you can be immune to all poisons

157
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,790
after you take it.

158
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,440
Then

159
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,910
I can rest assured.

160
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,200
What’s more,

161
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,370
that’s what your uncle wants.

162
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,030
Mr. Shangguan,

163
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
did my uncle mention anything else

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,710
about me

165
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,590
before he asked you to protect me?

166
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,230
He mentioned your name,

167
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,440
and your birthday.

168
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,290
No wonder you knew
the animal of my birth year.

169
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,710
Anything else?

170
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,110
No.

171
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,910
Did he

172
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
entrust you

173
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,710
anything special?

174
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,710
No.

175
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,710
I never asked anything about you.

176
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,230
Nor did I ever inquire

177
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,290
any of his privacy.

178
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,790
I promised him that I’ll protect you

179
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,760
because he saved my life once.

180
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,590
Saved your life?

181
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,050
When did he save your life?

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Mr. Shangguan.

183
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
I always wonder

184
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,710
why can you be both the son of
the Imperial Adviser

185
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,030
and the leader of the Moon Valley?

186
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,040
Do you want to know it?

187
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,640
I won’t tell you.

188
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,550
Do you have any

189
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,880
dirty secret?

190
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,470
I’ll ask my uncle

191
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,110
if you don’t tell me.

192
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,790
Okay, you win.

193
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,400
Fine.

194
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,760
I’ll tell you.

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,910
Five years ago,

196
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,240
I was plotted by an enemy

197
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,630
and was assassinated by him.

198
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
Stop.

199
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,230
You’re poisoned.

200
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,880
Who are you?

201
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,990
What did you just give me?

202
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,680
This is Poison Immune Pill.

203
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,490
This can detoxify your poison.

204
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,000
Besides, you can be immune to all poisons.

205
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,550
Thank you, sir.

206
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,440
So,

207
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,170
you had one Poison Immune Pill?

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,080
Then, why did they assassinate you?

209
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,000
And they even poisoned you?

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,730
They clearly tried to kill you.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Are they your father’s enemies?

212
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,000
Because I heard

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,860
that the court is much more scheming
than the world.

214
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,440
Fine.

215
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,700
I’m done commenting.
You can keep going.

216
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,640
After that,

217
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,770
Mr. Lin and I happened to pass by this place

218
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,260
and found it pretty and peaceful.

219
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,470
So,

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,910
I decided to live in seclusion here.

221
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,910
That’s how the Moon Valley is built.

222
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,030
It was lucky for you

223
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,320
to meet my uncle.

224
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,350
But later,

225
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,760
he decided to leave

226
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,880
after I started to recover.

227
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,960
How are you feeling?

228
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,730
I feel much better.

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,210
I don’t know how to repay

230
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,150
your rescue of my life.

231
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,230
If you don’t mind,

232
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,400
and this place is quiet

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,440
and pretty,

234
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,030
how about

235
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,790
staying here with me?

236
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,550
I’ll take good care of you

237
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
for the rest of your life.

238
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Is it palliative care?

239
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,310
I can’t take it, then.

240
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,530
You misunderstand it, sir.

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,880
I just want to do

242
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,280
everything I can

243
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,910
to repay you.

244
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,000
You’re grateful.

245
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,350
Give me your hand.

246
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,760
You’re a natural talent for martial arts.

247
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,670
Tell me,

248
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,570
who is it that tried to
abolish your martial arts?

249
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,520
I think you’re a talent.

250
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,840
What about I

251
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,760
pass you half

252
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,090
of my life cultivation?

253
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,320
You can see it

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,960
as my gift.

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,790
Sir.

256
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,760
You...

257
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,710
He gave me half of his martial arts cultivation

258
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,600
so that I can be as excellent as I am now.

259
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,910
My uncle is straightforward.

260
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,590
It means he trusts you

261
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,670
if he is willing to give half
of his cultivation to you.

262
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,710
You’re trustworthy for him.

263
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,069
So,

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,829
Keep it.

265
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,210
It was supposed to be yours.

266
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,400
No.

267
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,800
It is too precious.

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
I think

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,520
you should give it to someone
who needs it more.

270
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,310
What do you want me to do

271
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,819
so that you can keep it?

272
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,680
What about let’s have a game?

273
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,230
I’ll keep it if you win.

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Okay.

275
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,640
I’ll do what you said.

276
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,920
You lost.

277
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,160
Ms. Chong.

278
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,710
Please keep

279
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,000
your promise.

280
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,280
Take it.

281
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,800
I can break my promise.

282
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,600
I don’t care. You can’t force me.

283
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,310
It’s fine if you don’t care

284
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,440
or I can’t force you.

285
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
It took my great efforts

286
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,800
to get this Poison Immune Pill

287
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
from Mr. Yin Ci.

288
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,920
Ms. Chong.

289
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,640
Be good.

290
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Take it.

291
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,660
How do you feel?

292
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,920
Ms. Chong? Ms. Chong?

293
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,950
Ms. Chong spit blood

294
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
not because she took the pill

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,560
but because she had internal injuries
a few days ago.

296
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Plus, she hurt her inner force
when she tried to use it.

297
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,000
She has to rest for a few days.

298
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,280
I must have been hurt

299
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,230
Yin.

300
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,800
Can she fully recover?

301
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,710
Are you humiliating me?

302
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,040
Do you look down on my skills

303
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
or her health condition?

304
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,200
Rest assured.

305
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,230
She will recover

306
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,930
after a few portions of medical herbs.

307
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,560
It’s so kind of you, Yin.

308
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
This herb,

309
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,680
bowl and drink one portion of it a day

310
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,070
at midnight.

311
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,430
And take this pill

312
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
every 7 a.m.

313
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,590
Wait. Wait.

314
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,880
That’s too much.

315
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,590
And I need to take them at specific time?

316
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,650
It’s complicated.

317
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,280
Some medicine is positive,

318
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,000
which have to be taken in daytime,

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,230
while some of them are negative,

320
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,030
which have to be taken at nights.

321
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,350
They have different effects

322
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,590
and functions.

323
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,680
You have to take them accordingly.

324
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,520
Sir.

325
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,470
Are you trying to give me a hard time?

326
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,800
Ms. Chong.

327
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
Mr. Yin is a recluse and a doctor,

328
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,510
residing at Moon Valley.

329
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,690
He knows well how to use medicines.

330
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,710
I’ll keep the times for the medicines

331
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,640
for you.

332
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,520
Ms. Chong.

333
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,240
I won’t treat you

334
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
like an animal.

335
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
I’ll heal you.

336
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,160
Remember,

337
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,680
never fight

338
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
or use your inner strength

339
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,100
before you fully recover.

340
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Thank you so much.

341
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,760
Sweetie,

342
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,570
rest well and recover soon.

343
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,470
Tou,

344
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
please take good care of her.

345
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,710
Of course.

346
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Sir.

347
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,520
Is this for Ms. Chong?

348
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,230
What do you think?

349
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,920
It’s so bitter.

350
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,190
Bitter but effective.

351
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,070
Excuse me.

352
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,190
Can you make it

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,830
less bitter?

354
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,190
Petals?

355
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,190
Put them in.

356
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,950
Then the medicine will be less bitter.

357
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
Will these affect the medicine?

358
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,310
No.

359
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,350
Neither will it improve the effect.

360
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,030
Maybe they’re useful

361
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,470
for emotional pleasure.

362
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,470
I’ll go gather herbs.

363
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,070
Thank you, sir.

364
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,590
Why are there petals?

365
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,310
They can remove the bitterness

366
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,430
so that the medicine won’t

367
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,560
taste that bitter.

368
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
If I known it earlier,

369
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,280
I’ll put some into the tea I made for you.

370
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,470
Ms. Chong,

371
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,130
you don’t have to take care of me like that.

372
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,000
I have to.

373
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,160
I

374
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,090
didn’t do it well this time,

375
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,430
but I can do better

376
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,310
in the future.

377
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,470
Mr. Shangguan,

378
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,950
have you ever

379
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,400
protected a girl

380
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,470
like you’ve done to me?

381
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,680
Never.

382
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,190
Well.

383
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,800
Have you

384
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,070
ever taken care of a girl

385
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
like you’ve done to me?

386
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,760
Never.

387
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,000
I heard some rumors

388
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,710
at the Winehouse of Fairyland,

389
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,710
saying that you’re a play boy

390
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,040
that you have broken

391
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,440
the hearts of many girls,

392
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,140
and that you fell in love with many girls.

393
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,840
Do you buy it?

394
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,280
You’re

395
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
a so-called witch

396
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,680
according to the rumors.

397
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,310
My rumors were spread

398
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,840
by me intentionally.

399
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,090
That’s the difference between us.

400
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,710
Intentionally?

401
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,710
Why?

402
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,470
Never mind.

403
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,630
It has something to do

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,110
with my clan.

405
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,150
Don’t you care what they’d think of you?

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,310
It makes no difference

407
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,830
if I care or not.

408
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,880
There’s a line

409
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,830
between right and wrong.

410
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,680
Ms. Chong,

411
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,110
does it matter to you

412
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,740
what kind of person

413
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,310
I am?

414
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Of course it does.

415
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,310
Although,

416
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,040
I have known you not for long,

417
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:08,640
we

418
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,210
experienced many things together

419
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,630
that others never experienced before.

420
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,800
You are right.

421
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,400
But,

422
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,430
we’re from different worlds.

423
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,640
The real me

424
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,580
may not be the same in your cognition.

425
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,310
I’ll leave you alone.

426
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,520
Bunny, here is your carrot.

427
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,040
Bunny,

428
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,400
tell me.

429
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,880
What does he

430
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,590
mean?

431
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,160
Why would he

432
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,280
let people speak ill of him?

433
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,770
Can it be that

434
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,350
his family

435
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,320
arranged an engagement for him?

436
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
But he doesn’t like that girl

437
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,160
so he released those rumors

438
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,880
to scare her away?

439
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
If he’s engaged,

440
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,070
there should be rumors.

441
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,070
I know.

442
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,350
He must say these to me intentionally

443
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,680
to scare me away.

444
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,430
But,

445
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,400
he

446
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,040
denied that

447
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,410
he has ever protected any girl.

448
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,590
If he feels nothing about me,

449
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,950
why would he

450
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,010
take good care of me

451
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,280
along the way?

452
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,560
But,

453
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,160
he never admits

454
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,160
that he likes me.

455
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,000
eat it.

456
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,000
You don’t want it?

457
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,260
You refuse to respond.

458
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,780
[I’ll be waiting for you]

459
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,660
[I’ll be waiting for you
at the grove behind the Hall. Xuezhi]

460
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,110
Xuezhi.

461
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,880
Xuezhi.

462
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,160
Xuezhi.

463
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,350
Master.

464
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,740
The leader is gone.

465
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,760
I can’t find him

466
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,310
in the whole Hall.

467
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,280
Bunny.

468
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,430
Calm down.

469
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,680
Ms. Chong

470
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
wouldn’t see you suffer.

471
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,950
So,

472
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,400
I’ll release you all.

473
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,590
Then,

474
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,950
she can rest assured.

475
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,230
Go now.

476
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,560
Yin, you ask to see me?

477
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,290
Is anything wrong with Xuezhi?

478
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,880
Changran.

479
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,680
She’s fine.

480
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,520
Let’s have a drink.

481
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,430
Come on.

482
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,640
I am not in the mood.

483
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,560
I need to test on you with my medicines.

484
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,590
Test?

485
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,000
What kind of test?

486
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,470
Shangguan Tou

487
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,710
released

488
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,430
all my rabbits, chicken and ducks.

489
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,430
I have no animals to test on.

490
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,560
I have to test on you.

491
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,640
I...

492
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,310
I am in perfect condition.

493
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,570
I don’t need your test.

494
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,210
How about that?

495
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,830
I’ll buy you

496
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,930
those animals.

497
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,230
It’s too late.

498
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,690
-It’s too late.
-It’s not.

499
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,160
Sir.

500
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,110
He asks to see you.

501
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,820
You need to see me, sir?

502
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,420
Mr. Shangguan,

503
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,870
it’s great that you come.

504
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,710
Tell me,

505
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,710
you released

506
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,290
all my rabbits, didn’t you?

507
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,160
I did.

508
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,350
How about my ducks?

509
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,390
I released them, too.

510
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,810
Then don’t blame me.

511
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Let me run my tests on you.

512
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,710
Tests?

513
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
It’s for Ms. Chong.

514
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,090
Should we test it before giving it to her?

515
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,280
Of course we should

516
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,740
since it’s for her.

517
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,640
Okay, then.

518
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,800
Listen,

519
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,160
it’ll take another hour

520
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
before it’s done.

521
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,470
Remember to take it.

522
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,280
Listen,

523
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,560
this is a medicine

524
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,880
newly developed by me.

525
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,920
Unknown side effects

526
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,110
may occur.

527
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,110
I’ll close the door for you

528
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,830
so that embarrassment is avoided
from the servants.

529
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,230
Take it.

530
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,590
Take it and rest assured.

531
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
Keep a close eye on it.

532
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,110
Nothing special.

533
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,540
It’s you again.

534
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,590
Did you see my uncle?

535
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,160
He was at Mr. Yin’s place to test medicines.

536
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,910
Why is the door closed

537
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,710
if they are testing?

538
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,310
Can it be herbal bath?

539
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,350
Uncle.

540
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,870
Are you in an herbal bath?

541
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,640
I feel upset and annoyed.

542
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,770
I need to talk to you.

543
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,680
What about I talk to you outside?

544
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,110
I may understand

545
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,350
what “waiting” and “missing”

546
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,110
you mentioned means.

547
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,430
I know

548
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,590
now,

549
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,920
we haven’t found out who stole
the Nine Moves of Lotus God

550
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,430
and we don’t have any clues of

551
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,360
the traitors of the Hall of Flames.

552
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,090
I shouldn’t have a crush

553
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,070
on Mr. Shangguan at this time.

554
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,400
But,

555
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,950
I can’t lie to myself

556
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,430
about what I feel about him.

557
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,890
Ever since the Hero Assembly,

558
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,350
Mr. Shangguan

559
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,520
rescued my life for several times.

560
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,920
He told me

561
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,180
how scheming and dirty

562
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,920
this world and its people can be.

563
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,560
Then,

564
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,880
he escorted me all the way here

565
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,760
to the Moon Valley

566
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,020
so that we can reunite.

567
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,830
In this process,

568
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,000
I think that

569
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Mr. Shangguan

570
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,710
is trustworthy that I want to be
with him for the rest of my life.

571
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,590
He is

572
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,510
a person that deserves my heart.

573
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,070
Right. Uncle.

574
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
You’ve known him for years.

575
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,760
Do you know well about him?

576
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,000
Rumors have it

577
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,430
that he’s a play boy

578
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,580
who flirts with lots of women.

579
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,470
But I don’t think he is

580
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,350
according to what I saw.

581
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,280
He told me

582
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,830
that the rumors

583
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,350
were spread by him

584
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,840
and he doesn’t care.

585
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,800
But I do.

586
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,170
I hate it when people speak ill of him.

587
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,800
Uncle.

588
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Since

589
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
my father was gone,

590
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,070
you left the Hall.

591
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,810
The Hall of Flames is closed for years.

592
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,400
I was caged by it

593
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,070
only with Muyuan being my company.

594
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,830
I thought life is dull and boring.

595
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,430
I don’t know

596
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,880
the meaning of my life.

597
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,070
But,

598
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,950
my world changed

599
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
since I left the Hall

600
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,310
and met Mr. Shangguan.

601
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,190
I am so happy

602
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,800
and pleasant

603
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,670
being with him.

604
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,320
But,

605
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,760
uncle,

606
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,199
I think Mr. Shangguan

607
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,360
has tried to avoid me

608
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,389
recently.

609
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,840
I don’t know

610
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,600
if I did anything wrong

611
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,870
that irritates him.

612
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,949
I can feel

613
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,870
his pain clearly.

614
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,360
I don’t know how to comfort him.

615
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,320
Seeing him in pain

616
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,150
makes me painful, too.

617
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,670
Uncle,

618
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,560
tell me.

619
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,150
Is it

620
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,230
love?

621
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,670
Uncle,

622
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,760
tell me...

623
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,320
Mr. Shang...

624
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,280
Ms. Chong,

625
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,910
I heard

626
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,150
what you said.

627
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,840
Good.

628
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,950
Anyway,

629
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,600
I was about to tell you this.

630
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,670
The other day,

631
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,490
I haven’t thanked you for your tea.

632
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,520
Today,

633
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,040
thank you for being frank.

634
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,670
But

635
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,520
I don’t think I deserve your love.

636
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,560
If you wish me all the best

637
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,120
please don’t force me.

638
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,390
What do you mean?

639
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,630
Then,

640
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,560
you saved my life for several times

641
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,670
protected me,

642
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,190
gave me gifts,

643
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
got me the Poison Immune Pill

644
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,570
and risked your life for me,

645
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,360
not because you love me,

646
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,770
but because...

647
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,870
because

648
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,560
you need to repay my uncle?

649
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,910
I just

650
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,670
want to

651
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,670
keep you safe.

652
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,870
My task is accomplished

653
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,560
when you arrive at Hall of Flames
safe and sound.

654
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,630
That’s it?

655
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,040
Then,

656
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,320
do you dare to say

657
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,520
that

658
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,810
you’ve never had a crush on me?

659
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,080
If you say no,

660
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,430
I’ll let it go.

661
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,560
I’ll not pester you.

662
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,760
Say something. Mr. Shangguan.

663
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,620
That’s enough.

664
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,840
Ms. Chong.

665
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,840
I, Shangguan Tou,

666
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,230
feel nothing

667
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,560
about you.

668
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,630
I don’t love you.

669
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,390
What I did for you

670
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,550
was just to repay Mr. Lin
for his saving my life.

671
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,410
I’ll make an apology

672
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,000
if I did anything

673
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,190
that makes you misunderstand that.

674
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,520
Well, then...

675
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,040
I flattered myself.

676
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,520
Well.

677
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,950
Well.

678
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,080
Now that

679
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,840
you don’t love me,

680
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,710
I’ll leave you alone.

681
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,760
I hope that you

682
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,760
know what you’re thinking

683
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760
and mean your words.

684
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,280
Sir.

685
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,820
You asked to see me?

686
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,230
Be seated.

687
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,190
Drink with me.

688
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,710
Come on.

689
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,910
I’ve witnessed

690
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,830
what happened in the valley.

691
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,410
Xuezhi has grown up.

692
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,280
I’m her uncle,

693
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,390
but you have to solve it

694
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,870
when it comes to your relationship.

695
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
However...

696
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,360
You want to know

697
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,360
why I would turn her down, right?

698
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
I’ve known you for years.

699
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,150
You always remain restrained

700
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,610
and haven’t changed a bit.

701
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,710
I don’t understand.

702
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,870
Do you feel nothing

703
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,390
towards Xuezhi?

704
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,230
Ms. Chong

705
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,630
is an accident

706
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,360
in my life.

707
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
She is a gift

708
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,390
sent by the heaven,

709
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,950
which is precious and valuable.

710
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,890
At the very beginning,

711
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,150
I just wanted to repay you

712
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,000
because you rescued my life.

713
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,320
So I tried my best

714
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,520
to protect her.

715
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,140
Nevertheless,

716
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,680
I gradually feel different

717
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,150
as the time we spend together

718
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,840
goes by.

719
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
I love to see her

720
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,120
and to be with her.

721
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,840
Her smile makes me happy.

722
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,270
Her sorrow pains me, too.

723
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,470
I like it.

724
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,800
But,

725
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,510
I am frightened and panicked

726
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,000
when I discovered

727
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,710
that Ms. Chong

728
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,000
feels the same towards me.

729
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,390
Now that you feel something between you two,

730
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,390
why would you hide your feelings?

731
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,470
You can tell her how you feel.

732
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,910
Sir,

733
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,060
I never get along well with my family,

734
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,080
or with my father,

735
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,710
but I am a descendant of my family.

736
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,530
Such a noble family

737
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,990
would definitely introduce me into the court.

738
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,070
My future life is full of unknown troubles.

739
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,000
I don’t want her

740
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,080
to live such a life with me.

741
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,190
More importantly,

742
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
I am a witness

743
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,370
of my father’s indifference towards my mother.

744
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,170
I’ve never felt the warmth of a family.

745
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,800
I don’t know

746
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,080
how to love someone,

747
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,080
or how to accept someone’s love

748
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,950
and her trust.

749
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,910
I don’t think you’re that ruthless.

750
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,430
Why don’t you try to

751
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,510
open your heart for someone?

752
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,430
I can’t.

753
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,100
I’m so frightened.

754
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,190
I’m afraid that once I open my heart,

755
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,320
I would

756
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,430
enforce my resistance into Ms. Chong.

757
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,040
If I can’t let go of my burden,

758
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,520
if I can’t give her a complete me,

759
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,760
I’ll bring pains

760
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,710
and sorrows to her.
