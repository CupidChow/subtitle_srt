[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 38

4
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,389
Since he won first prize in the Hero Assembly,

5
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,800
I appreciate him very much.

6
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

7
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,520
Welcome to our manor.

8
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,880
Fengzi and I will call on you to express gratitude.

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright. Alright.

10
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,270
I've admired you.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,800
In the future,

12
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
I have many things

13
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,270
to count on you.

14
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,390
Okay.

15
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,740
Your Highness.

16
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,190
I’m already a commoner.

17
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,010
He’s just an ordinary kungfu practitioner.

18
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,390
How can we afford Your Highness's favor?

19
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,750
Uncle.

20
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,550
Don't misunderstand me.

21
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,390
I came here this time

22
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,960
just to be close to you.

23
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,110
Since childhood,

24
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,880
I’ve thought kungfu practitioners are awesome,

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,470
let alone talented people

26
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,270
like Young Hero Xia.

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,030
I have yearned for kungfu since my childhood,

28
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,210
but because of my poor health,

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,370
I can’t practice it.

30
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,360
So even if I want to do something,

31
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,360
I have no strength.

32
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,750
Uncle, Sword Manor

33
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,000
enjoys high prestige in Wulin.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,000
And all sects in Wulin follow your lead.

35
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,670
If you help me get what I want,

36
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,270
it will

37
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,079
get twice the result with half the effort.

38
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,520
All of you may leave.

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
Yes.

40
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,880
You mean that

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,280
you want me to help you

42
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,750
control Wulin.

43
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,850
You should say it like this.

44
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,440
You

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,520
and I

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
can make Wulin better.

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,390
Lord Lu is very modest

48
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,720
and cherishes talents.

49
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,790
He takes good care of people on the same side.

50
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,270
But he isn’t soft on

51
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,920
those disloyal to him.

52
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,950
Now Hall of Flames has been sealed up.

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,270
Mr. Lin.

54
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
You should

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,760
make arrangements for yourself.

56
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,390
Was Hall of Flames sealed up

57
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,070
because of you?

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,159
I just wanted to have a chat.

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,760
Why did you mention

60
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,220
these unrelated matters?

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,230
Yes.

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,580
Young Hero Xia.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,390
I heard that in the Hero Assembly,

64
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,720
you were excellent and unrivaled.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,480
But I didn't have a chance to see it.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,440
If you don't mind,

67
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,950
can you

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,480
have a competition with my warrior

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
to feast my eyes?

70
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Qingmei.

71
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,510
Since Lord Lu said so,

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
you can have a try.

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,760
Remember.

74
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,160
Stop at where it should.

75
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
You may leave.

76
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Your Highness, please forgive him.

77
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,470
There is a winner or loser

78
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,000
in the competition.

79
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,720
But I hope

80
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,230
you

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
can fight with all your strength next time.

82
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,200
Well,

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
so,

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,720
I’m leaving.

85
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,410
Please think about

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,230
what I said just now.

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,200
If we are united,

88
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,159
we will

89
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,200
be ever successful.

90
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,060
Your Highness.

91
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,650
You just fought with Xia Qingyang.

92
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,960
What do you think of his kungfu?

93
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,250
Your Highness.

94
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,250
Although he uses ordinary moves,

95
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,440
he has strong inner strength,

96
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,550
far better than me.

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Your Highness.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,350
What do you want to do next?

99
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,790
Since he doesn't want to fight with my people,

100
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,470
I'll find another one to fight with him.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,510
If a man who has a grudge against him

102
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,320
is in front of him,

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,640
he must

104
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,920
be able to fight with him.

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,070
Qingmei.

106
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,350
Just now,

107
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,570
Lord Lu obviously wanted to test your kungfu.

108
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,130
I don’t know his intention,

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
but you must remember

110
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,790
not to show your real strength.

111
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,230
Okay.

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,000
But

113
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,480
I think Lord Lu

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,050
might test me again.

115
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,800
We don’t need to worry about the competition.

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,680
In my opinion,

117
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,710
he came here this time

118
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,500
to send wedding gifts on the surface,

119
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,670
but in fact, he is forcing us with authority.

120
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,330
You heard what the adviser said just now.

121
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm afraid he wanted to

122
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,270
warn us with Hall of Flames

123
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,000
and draw Sword Manor to serve him.

124
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,070
Serve him?

125
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,950
He is a prince.

126
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,390
Why is he suddenly so interested in Wulin?

127
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,390
Last time when we had a family dinner,

128
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,920
I found that he was quite interested in Wulin.

129
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,830
According to what he did today,

130
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,830
he has coveted Wulin for a long time.

131
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,720
Hall of Flames

132
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,050
has been removed by him.

133
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,920
Next one

134
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,520
will be Sword Manor, I’m afraid.

135
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,310
How do we deal with it?

136
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,270
I must stop him.

137
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,690
I will warn the whole Wulin

138
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,160
of his plot.

139
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,550
The Jianghu has been broken up for many years.

140
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,150
It's time to unite all sects.

141
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,110
But Qingmei,

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,350
I have to invite some unrelated persons

143
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,080
to attend your wedding.

144
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,150
Master, it doesn’t matter.

145
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,880
I’ll follow your arrangement.

146
00:08:43,380 --> 00:09:01,140
[Sword Manor]

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,960
Take invitations and send them to all the sects.

148
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,400
Brother Xia. Brother Xia.

149
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,760
Be careful.

150
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,150
You must send invitations

151
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,810
to the chiefs of all the sects.

152
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

153
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,760
Let’s go.

154
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
Your Highness, as you expected,

155
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,400
Lin Zongxing

156
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,200
sent his disciples out

157
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
at midnight.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
According to the spy,

159
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,960
they went to

160
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,000
Emei Sect,

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,730
Shangqing Sect and Luduan Temple respectively.

162
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,110
He intended to keep everything simple,

163
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,410
but now he wants to entertain guests.

164
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,350
So he has to send invitations in secret.

165
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,110
Lin Zongxing is careful.

166
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,550
He deliberately avoided Huashan Sect.

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,590
Since Uncle Lin didn't invite Chief Feng,

168
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,670
let's have him come here on his own.

169
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,000
I have to get them together.

170
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,590
Feng Mo

171
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,470
is indispensable.

172
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,960
Yes.

173
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,300
Your Highness.

174
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,230
What should we do next?

175
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Lin Zongxing considers carefully.

176
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,640
The pressure I put on him in the daytime

177
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,150
has bothered him.

178
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
But he doesn't know

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,710
what my real intention is.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,030
So he's just trying to woo people

181
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,440
to protect himself

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,440
He

183
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,970
helps me gather people from the Wulin,

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,880
I feel relieved.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,330
The day when Sword Manor holds the wedding

186
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,000
is the day when Sects Alliance is established.

187
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,210
Has Chief Guardian come back?

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,880
Not yet.

189
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,320
Do you think

190
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,790
Chong Xuezhi

191
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,210
will die this time?

192
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Yuwen Muyuan was eager for an antidote.

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,840
As the old saying goes,

194
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,170
care brings confusion.

195
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,840
Perhaps the fake antidote

196
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,910
has been taken by Chong Xuezhi.

197
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
It depends on her luck.

198
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,400
I hope Chief Guardian will come back soon.

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,910
I need him when I take actions

200
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,710
Have you met the commander of imperial guards?

201
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,520
I just visited him.

202
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,840
For the search of Imperial Advisor’s Mansion,

203
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,300
he handled it impartially and was rewarded.

204
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,140
He is very grateful to Your Highness.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,350
He got a report

206
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,960
and enjoyed the fruits of others' work.

207
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,290
How could he not like it?

208
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,840
So when he heard that

209
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,320
he could return the favor,

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,550
he agreed.

211
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,470
Okay.

212
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,230
Let his people wait.

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,000
If the people I'm waiting for don't come,

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,760
his men

215
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,110
are just on standby.

216
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
You may leave.

217
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,670
Yes.

218
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,710
How can a common fellow

219
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,490
read the mind of a great man?

220
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,960
I put it here.

221
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,150
Here.

222
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,550
Wait.

223
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,280
I…

224
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,520
I put it here.

225
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Are you sure?

226
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,320
Wait.

227
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,960
Take it back.

228
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,350
I’ll make a change.

229
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,880
Make a change.

230
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,080
A gentleman should not retract in a chess game.

231
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,410
Do you understand that?

232
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,110
But I am a girl.

233
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,640
I just got the news.

234
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,840
Lin Zongxing sent invitations

235
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,670
to chiefs of all sects

236
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,910
to gather at Sword Manor

237
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,840
on the fourth day of the next month.

238
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,440
It’s strange.

239
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Uncle Lin never gets involved in affairs of Wulin.

240
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,000
He even sent Chief Disciple to participate in

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,710
the biennial Hero Assembly.

242
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,400
This time,

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,590
how could he

244
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,790
invite all sects in Wulin

245
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,110
to Sword Manor?

246
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,350
Xuezhi.

247
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,350
Do you remember

248
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,150
when Mr. Lin stood out last time?

249
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,670
Do you mean that the five-year agreement

250
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,550
Uncle Lin made

251
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,170
with all sects in Wulin

252
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,690
to protect Hall of Flames?

253
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,840
Right.

254
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Sword Manor

255
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,840
is the largest sect in Wulin at present.

256
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
But Mr. Lin

257
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,200
keeps a low profile.

258
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,670
In Wulin,

259
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,200
he always remains neutral.

260
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,640
That's why all sects in Wulin trust him

261
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,520
and respect Sword Manor.

262
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,550
Except for

263
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,440
the five-year agreement he made for Hall of Flames,

264
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,550
Mr. Lin

265
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,280
has hardly interfered in affairs of Wulin.

266
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,110
This time,

267
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,110
in the name of Sword Manor,

268
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,350
he gathers all sects.

269
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,880
It must be a great event vital to Wulin.

270
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,960
I'm not as thorough as you think,

271
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,230
but I also think

272
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,560
Lin Zongxing's is very strange this time.

273
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,880
Tou.

274
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,400
Do you have any plans?

275
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,470
Xuezhi and I have a special identity.

276
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,910
Let's wait and see.

277
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,440
Tou.

278
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,440
It's vital to Wulin.

279
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,080
Do we really not participate?

280
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,910
Mr. Lin took great pains.

281
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,110
It must be Xue Lie who is forcing him.

282
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,200
You and I are Xue Lie's eyesore.

283
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,880
If we act rashly,

284
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,520
we may provoke him.

285
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,740
I'm afraid that Mr.Lin’s plan

286
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,960
will be in vain.

287
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,230
Let’s

288
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,110
just wait and see

289
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,080
and take no action.

290
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,760
When we have the exact information,

291
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,820
we will make a plan.

292
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,590
Okay.

293
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,350
But no matter what happens,

294
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,840
you can't hide it from me.

295
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,500
Let's face it together, okay?

296
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,520
I promise you.

297
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,080
Sister Hongxiu.

298
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,520
Xuezhi.

299
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,470
You don't taken medicine today, right?

300
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,180
[To Shangguan Tou]

301
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,590
They prepared it just now.

302
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,850
I'll ask her to take you to drink it, okay?

303
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Tou.

304
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,910
You have to stay.

305
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,030
I have to calculate

306
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,080
your food, drink and accommodation fees

307
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,680
in Winehouse of Fairyland during this period.

308
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,690
I’ll follow your arrangement.

309
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,200
Xuezhi.

310
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
You go first. I'll be there later

311
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,550
Hongxiu.

312
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,440
What’s up?

313
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,260
[To Shangguan Tou]

314
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,250
This is a letter from Crown Prince of Dongdu.

315
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,960
Crown prince?

316
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,550
Chief Guardian.

317
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,110
I've been

318
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
concerned about you.

319
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
I, Yuwen Muyuan,

320
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,530
will pledge to follow Your highness.

321
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Chief Guardian.

322
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,500
What’s the matter?

323
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,450
Please stand up.

324
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,440
Has

325
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,230
Master Chong been cured?

326
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,210
Chong Xuezhi doesn't need me anymore.

327
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,320
Or rather,

328
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,400
She never needed me.

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,980
Shangguan Tou is with her.

330
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
How could she see me?

331
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,320
Is

332
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
the antidote not working?

333
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,010
Shangguan Tou is with her all the time.

334
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,000
How could she take the antidote I gave her?

335
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,250
The antidote Your Highness gave me

336
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,300
was thrown away by me in a rage.

337
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,720
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

338
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,530
It doesn’t matter.

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
I gave it to you.

340
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,270
You can dispose of it at will.

341
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,520
I just feel sorry for you.

342
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,670
In the end,

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
you still failed.

344
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,150
Since she trampled on my love

345
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,030
again and again,

346
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,000
why should I care about her?

347
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,330
Just think about what I’ve done for her so many years,

348
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,960
I feel unworthy.

349
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,840
What’s your

350
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,080
next plan?

351
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,880
From now on,

352
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,670
in my mind,

353
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,430
there will be no more personal affection,

354
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,280
but

355
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,980
only Hall of Flames

356
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,680
and Your Highness’ Sects Alliance.

357
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,760
Guards.

358
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,800
Guards.

359
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,280
Yuwen Muyuan,

360
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,990
in front of His Highness,

361
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,400
no weapons are allowed.

362
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,800
Your Highness, thank you.

363
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,950
I, Yuwen Muyuan,

364
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,770
will pledge to follow Your highness,

365
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,760
so will

366
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,470
Hall of Flames.

367
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,040
Step back.

368
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,780
Great Guardian, please stand up.

369
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,080
That's what a real man should do.

370
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,280
Instead of being trapped in love,

371
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,850
you should try your best

372
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,350
to achieve a great cause.

373
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,310
I

374
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,630
will do my best

375
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,560
to help Hall of Flames.

376
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,810
Thank you, Your Highness.

377
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
The Crown Prince said in the letter that

378
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,310
Imperial Advisor’s Mansion had been checked.

379
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,370
There is something

380
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,830
he wants to hand over to me personally.

381
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,030
So he invites me to go.

382
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:33,920
Do you trust him?

383
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,590
What's your plan?

384
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,710
At that time,

385
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,190
when my father was put in jail unjustly,

386
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,400
it was Crown Prince

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,190
who explained the situation to His Majesty.

388
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,950
So my sister and I were not involved in the case,

389
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,680
and survived.

390
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,400
I know very well that

391
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,950
His Highness's

392
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,760
invitation

393
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,830
is just a pretext.

394
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,070
He can't tell

395
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
the truth.

396
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,490
The thing that he can’t tell me

397
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,070
must be a tough one.

398
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,190
Tou.

399
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,560
You just rescued Xuezhi.

400
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,950
Lord Lu's business

401
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,800
has nothing to do with you.

402
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,190
Why do you get involved in it?

403
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,850
On my father's fiftieth birthday,

404
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,560
he taught me that

405
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,350
no matter whether I’d engage in politics or not,

406
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,080
we are subjects of His Majesty.

407
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,280
Loyalty, filial piety and righteousness

408
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,470
must be put first.

409
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,930
Now that you’ve made up your mind,

410
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,070
you have to think it carefully.

411
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,640
Don't act impulsively.

412
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,120
You can rest assured.

413
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,430
First,

414
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
Crown Prince is benevolent and virtuous.

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,110
He won't frame me.

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,710
Second,

417
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,310
in the Jianghu,

418
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,040
a storm is brewing.

419
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,040
If I keep avoiding,

420
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,160
I'm afraid that when Lord Lu is in power,

421
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,190
It’s impossible for me to acquire a peaceful end.

422
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,400
If I want to stay with Xuezhi forever,

423
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,950
I won’t allow him to do so.

424
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,640
I know

425
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,350
you've made up your mind.

426
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,050
It's no use persuading you.

427
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,910
I just want to tell you

428
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
to be careful.

429
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,950
Hongxiu.

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,070
After I leave,

431
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,800
I have to count on you

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,260
to take care of Xuezhi.

433
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,230
She has not yet fully recovered

434
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,560
and needs careful care.

435
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,070
You write down

436
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
all the fees.

437
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,590
When I come back,

438
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,950
I'll pay them in full.

439
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,110
Who asks you to pay?

440
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,230
Winehouse of Fairyland is huge.

441
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,560
Do I really mind if you

442
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
eat and live here?

443
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,190
You.

444
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,190
You promised Xuezhi

445
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,070
that you would never hide anything from her.

446
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,430
Did you forget that?

447
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,590
Even for selfish reasons,

448
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,090
I have to keep it

449
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,880
from her.

450
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,520
Alright, alright.

451
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,560
If you

452
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,000
love her less,

453
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,880
you won't be so selfish.

454
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,190
Sir.

455
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,290
For Yuwen Muyuan’s defection,

456
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,680
what do you think?

457
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,760
In my opinion,

458
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,110
we can trust him.

459
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,190
But after all, he is from the Jianghu.

460
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,430
We should be careful.

461
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,800
Chong Xuezhi is really lucky.

462
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,960
We failed to kill her this time.

463
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,640
Chong Xuezhi

464
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,400
will die sooner or later.

465
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,290
Your Highness, take your time.

466
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,470
We have got something this time.

467
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,350
Yuwen Muyuan

468
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,320
thinks no more of Chong Xuezhi.

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
It's not a waste

470
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,560
of my best poison.

471
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,950
Fortunately, the poison

472
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,920
wasn't found.

473
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,310
Otherwise,

474
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,500
it’s difficult for us to succeed.

475
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,760
I have passed Yuwen Muyuan’s test.

476
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,560
But he

477
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,760
hasn't passed my test yet.

478
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,950
I need to further test

479
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,470
his loyalty.

480
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,520
Xuezhi.

481
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,730
When I got back downtown

482
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,710
I realized how happy I was in the mountain.

483
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,770
The sun is covered pine trees.

484
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,750
Wine is made from plum blossoms.

485
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,350
But now…

486
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,560
From now on,

487
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,110
I can't be with you anymore.

488
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,180
What are you looking at me for?

489
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,480
You are quite pretty today.

490
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,000
So you mean

491
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,730
I was not pretty before?

492
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Of course not.

493
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,880
You are pretty all the time.

494
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,590
In fact,

495
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,320
I seem to have yearned for

496
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
the days like this for a long time.

497
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,040
Now I finally have them.

498
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I feel very happy.

499
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
We’ll have

500
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,170
a lot of them in the future.

501
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,040
Tou.

502
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Now,

503
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,110
when I think back to

504
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,280
our first meeting,

505
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,590
I feel like…

506
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,110
I feel like I'm dreaming.

507
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,350
Xuezhi.

508
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,240
It’s not a dream.

509
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,000
It’s true.

510
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,430
We've gone through

511
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,510
so many twists and turns,

512
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,890
and finally stayed together.

513
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,230
In the future,

514
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,000
nothing

515
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,350
can separate us.

516
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,760
Well,

517
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,310
when I recover,

518
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,720
we'll go back to Moon Valley

519
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,430
to stay with Uncle,

520
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,560
brew tea, grow flowers,

521
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,950
and pay no attention to other affairs, okay?

522
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,880
Pay no attention to other affairs?

523
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,640
Okay.

524
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,070
I listen to you.

525
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,070
Xuezhi.

526
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:47,040
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

527
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,170
I'm going to Dongdu.

528
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,860
I'll be back in three days.

529
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,800
With this red line,

530
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,560
I am anxious to return.

531
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,880
Wait for me.

532
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
[Lord Xin’s Mansion]

533
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,910
Don’t worry about me.

534
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,590
I wonder

535
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,950
why Your Highness

536
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,190
wants to see me.

537
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,500
Mr. Shangguan.

538
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,160
I do have a request.

539
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,410
Because of Lord Lu?

540
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,950
Now I

541
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,110
really can't see through

542
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,160
him.

543
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,480
He came to Dongdu this time,

544
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,590
in the name of

545
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,040
sending wedding gifts

546
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,440
to Uncle Lin’s daughter.

547
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,950
As far as I know,

548
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,640
Uncle Lin never invited

549
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,710
any officials.

550
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,310
He came uninvited this time.

551
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,680
I really feel uneasy.

552
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,800
But

553
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,430
you know,

554
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,710
not long

555
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,260
after he came to Dongdu last time,

556
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,470
Imperial Advisor…

557
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,590
Your Highness, I know what you mean.

558
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,870
I feel the same as Your Highness.

559
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
This time Lord Lu

560
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,950
came here

561
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,920
not just for sending gifts.

562
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,190
I heard that

563
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,830
Mr. Lin

564
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,040
sent out invitations

565
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,750
to all sects to attend the wedding banquet.

566
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,430
If I guess correctly,

567
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,710
Lord Lu

568
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,160
will certainly attend.

569
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,950
This time,

570
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,470
I can go and find out something

571
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,530
for Your Highness,

572
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,150
so that Your Highness can rest assured.

573
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,430
Well,

574
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,830
thank you.

575
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,430
I can't attend in person.

576
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,230
In Wulin,

577
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
I don't have anyone to trust.

578
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,210
So I have to trouble you.

579
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,210
For my father's injustice,

580
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,470
Your Highness helped the Shangguan family a lot.

581
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,310
Now,

582
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,040
since Your Highness has entrusted me,

583
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,950
I

584
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,800
will never refuse.

585
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,230
I know

586
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,310
Lord Lu

587
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,350
wanted to kill you.

588
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,590
But you can rest assured.

589
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,880
Although I can’t attend in person,

590
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,920
I will protect you

591
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,070
in secret.

592
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,680
Your Highness

593
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,890
is also suspicious of Lord Lu.

594
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,070
In the past,

595
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,680
I would never believe that Lord Lu

596
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,350
would do a rebellious thing.

597
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,590
But

598
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,230
since your father…

599
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,680
I know

600
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,540
Imperial Advisor died unjustly,

601
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,160
but I can't find any evidence.

602
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,560
If this matter

603
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
is really related to him,

604
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,470
such cruel and meticulous scheming

605
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,830
makes me

606
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
shudder.

607
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,440
You have long been estranged from Lord Lu.

608
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,350
What Lord Lu thinks,

609
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,470
of course you don’t know.

610
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,350
I've been fond of him.

611
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
He is my brother.

612
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,850
I know that he is not in good health,

613
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,800
so I always hope that

614
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,090
he can read more historical books,

615
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,350
and may be put in an important position.

616
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,160
If Lord Lu

617
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,680
could understand Your Highness,

618
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,040
now

619
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,950
he would not go astray.

620
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,920
Seriously,

621
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,580
I still don't believe he did those wrong things.

622
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,190
In fact, Lord Lu

623
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
is already mature.

624
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,130
But Your Highness doesn't want to believe that.

625
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,560
In that case,

626
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
I'd like to

627
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,090
go to find out the truth for Your Highness.

628
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,170
On the wedding day at Sword Manor,

629
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,680
I will send someone to protect you secretly.

630
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,940
But my men won't show up

631
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,640
until they have to.

632
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,920
Otherwise,

633
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,560
I’m afraid someone will make an issue of it.

634
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,560
So

635
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,230
we’ll

636
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,160
take the cuckoo's call as a signal.

637
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,400
In case of any accident,

638
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,430
you can follow the call

639
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,800
to a safe place.

640
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,980
Your Highness, thanks for your protection.

641
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,070
Your Highness.

642
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,000
Lord Lu came to Dongdu this time.

643
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Do you have any news about my sister?

644
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
I don’t know the details.

645
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,110
I only know that

646
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,430
Princess Lu

647
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,460
didn't come with him this time

648
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,130
That’s good.

649
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,590
She is safer

650
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,390
in Xiangzhou.

651
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,520
I'm really envious of

652
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
the relationship

653
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,120
between you and your sister.

654
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,230
My sister

655
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,430
is my only relative now.

656
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,110
As long as she is safe,

657
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,310
I am willing to bear everything for her.

658
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,170
Mr. Shangguan.

659
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,770
I'm counting on you.

660
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,760
Xuezhi.

661
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,090
What are you thinking?

662
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,160
Don't worry about him.

663
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,800
Hongxiu.

664
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Tou said

665
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,040
he will come back in three days.

666
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,880
Tomorrow is the last day.

667
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,590
I'm really worried.

668
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,470
Silly girl.

669
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,130
Don't worry about him anymore.

670
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,350
Be at ease.

671
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,760
Perhaps,

672
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,920
he is on his way back now.

673
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,190
Xuezhi.

674
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,310
Xuezhi.

675
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Hongxiu.

676
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Today is the third day.

677
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,400
I'll meet Tou in person.

678
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,900
[Sword Manor]

679
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,680
Here comes the bride.

680
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,120
They looks good.

681
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,760
Perfect match.

682
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,970
The first bow is for the heaven and earth.

683
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,560
Make a bow.

684
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,760
The second for the parents.

685
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,110
Make a bow.

686
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,000
The third for each other.

687
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,920
Make a bow.

688
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,830
Done.

689
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,950
Good, good.

690
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,880
Here comes Huashan Sect.

691
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,110
Is it him?

692
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,230
Congratulations, Mr. Lin.

693
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,710
Congratulations, Mr. Xia.

694
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,040
Is he here to make a mess?

695
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,040
Yes.

696
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,710
Sword Manor has a wedding.

697
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,920
Mr. Lin.

698
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,190
Why didn’t you invite Huashan Sect

699
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,730
to celebrate together?

700
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,640
Miss.

701
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
Don't take it off.

702
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
It's unlucky.

703
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,430
Qingmei.

704
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,190
Take Fengzi away.

705
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,950
Alright.

706
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,040
What’s happening?

707
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
They’re leaving?

708
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,680
Such a big day.

709
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,190
Mr. Lin.

710
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,890
Why do you have such a simple wedding?

711
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,170
I didn’t invite you to congratulate me today.

712
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,560
Chief Feng came here without invitation.

713
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,640
Good.

714
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,190
Both of us are in the Jianghu.

715
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,560
Since we can't avoid each other,

716
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,020
we'd better make it clear.

717
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,400
Mr. Lin, if you have anything,

718
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
just say it.

719
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,830
To be honest,

720
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,030
what I am talking about today

721
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,430
is related to Lord Lu.

722
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,520
Everybody,

723
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,429
Hall of Flames was destroyed suddenly.

724
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,290
Don't you think it's strange?

725
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,120
You mean

726
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,850
the event of Hall of Flames

727
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,710
has something to do with Lord Lu?

728
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,280
Priest Xingyi

729
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,040
You're slinging mud.

730
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,870
Lord Lu

731
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,000
is lenient.

732
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,739
He is not from the Jianghu.

733
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,389
How could he do such a thing?

734
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,520
Yes or no,

735
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,949
just have a test.

736
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,360
I guess Lord Lu will take actions soon.

737
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,120
His goal

738
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
is probably to

739
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,100
control the Wulin.

740
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,600
Mr. Lin, how do you want to test?

741
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,060
You have to state your stand before test.

742
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,630
If Lord Lu

743
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,270
does fight against the Wulin in the future,

744
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,150
whether against Sword Manor

745
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,840
or other sects,

746
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,630
will you

747
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,560
follow him?

748
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,610
Everybody.

749
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,280
Are you all confused?

750
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,040
Hall of Flames is a living example.

751
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,650
Now the Jianghu is in a state of flurry.

752
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,230
Without the care of Lord Lu,

753
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,650
I'm afraid it would have fallen apart.

754
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,610
It seems that Chief Feng

755
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,430
is determined to follow him.

756
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,320
If following Lord Lu

757
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,800
can benefit Wulin,

758
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,230
Huashan Sect

759
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,160
is willing to follow him.

760
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,910
Good.

761
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,360
Since Chief Feng has already made a statement,

762
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,190
I will…

763
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,040
Lord Lu is here.

764
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,600
Why is he here?

765
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Why is he here?

766
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,120
Yes.

767
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,040
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

768
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Pay respects to Your Highness.

769
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,730
Chief Feng, don’t to be polite.

770
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

771
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:51,520
Here comes Hall of Flames.

772
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,090
Hall of Flames is also here?

773
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,800
What's going on here?

774
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,080
Yeah.

775
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,430
Why Hall of Flames is here?

776
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,920
Chief Guardian, please.

777
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,190
Mr. Lin.

778
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,360
Long time no see.

779
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,390
It’s you.

780
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,190
You rat.

781
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,530
Why are you here?

782
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,910
Chief Feng.

783
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,710
Now he is my respected guest.

784
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,280
In such an occasion,

785
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,000
how can he not come?

786
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,120
Am I right?

787
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,000
Your Highness has already sent gifts, right?

788
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,320
Why are you

789
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,600
here again today?

790
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,910
I’ve sent gifts,

791
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
but

792
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,360
I should also congratulate them in person.

793
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,280
It's a pity the ceremony has finished.

794
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,430
Your Highness made the trip in vain.

795
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,150
Never mind.

796
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,630
Now that the ceremony has finished,

797
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,470
I'll discuss another event

798
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,390
in your place.

799
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,630
But as a host,

800
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,440
I really don't deserve this.

801
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,150
I think

802
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,800
the wedding

803
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,540
is cold and cheerless.

804
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,800
A wedding

805
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,040
needs a lot of people to be lively.

806
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,840
Right?

807
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,230
Master.

808
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,600
There are many officers and men outside.

809
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
What should we do?

810
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,360
Uncle, what’s up?

811
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,860
Your Highness.

812
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,810
Let’s have a chat in the side hall.

813
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,470
Your Highness.

814
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,430
What do you mean?

815
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,670
Uncle.

816
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,080
If you still don't understand me now,

817
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,390
we

818
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,550
may not be able to have a chat.

819
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:44,910
Your Highness.

820
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,040
Hall of Flames has been sealed up.

821
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,280
I just provide a shelter

822
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,710
for its disciples.

823
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,420
They are innocent.

824
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,800
Why do you press hard on them?

825
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,230
You know Hall of Flames is sealed up?

826
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,630
But by whom?

827
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,390
Me?

828
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,280
No.

829
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,610
It’s sealed up by His Majesty.

830
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,140
It’s sealed up according to laws.

831
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,970
I'm not disrespectful to His Majesty.

832
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,320
I just helped them

833
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,590
out of Jianghu morality.

834
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,580
What is Jianghu morality?

835
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,230
It's

836
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,670
a clear excuse for their lawlessness

837
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Your Highness.

838
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,150
You did this

839
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,120
just to get

840
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,650
the support of Sword Manor?

841
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,670
Uncle.

842
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,670
You are a wise man.

843
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,520
You know best

844
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,800
why Imperial Advisor was convicted that day.

845
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,080
You can’t get involved

846
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,740
in the event of Hall of Flames.

847
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,150
It’s okay that you saved

848
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,080
the disciples of Hall of Flames.

849
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,360
But you leaked out information.

850
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,050
And the imperial guards got the information.

851
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,600
If in your manor,

852
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,320
you have a conflict with the imperial guards

853
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,840
and make a big trouble,

854
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,000
even if I want to help you,

855
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,910
I am powerless.

856
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,190
I’m not afraid of death.

857
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,200
I just want a clear conscience.

858
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,430
I know

859
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,150
you

860
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,320
have integrity

861
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,440
and are not afraid of death.

862
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,080
But you have to know

863
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,040
why you die.

864
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,000
If the disciples of Hall of Flames you saved know

865
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,060
someone in Sword Manor practices Nine Moves secretly,

866
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,910
got a lot of lawsuits,

867
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,910
and made Hall of Flames a scapegoat,

868
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,760
I wonder if they will still

869
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,290
appreciate your kindness.

870
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Then Sword Manor

871
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
will lose its reputation.

872
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Impossible.

873
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,000
My disciples are always strict with themselves.

874
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,120
They will never steal kungfu from other sects,

875
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,520
let alone the Nine Moves.

876
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,220
It seems you still don't know.

877
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,080
As far as I know,

878
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,950
The one who practices the Nine Moves

879
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,190
is your own Chief Disciple,

880
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,670
Xia Qingmei.

881
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,040
No.

882
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,840
He is now your son-in-law.

883
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,950
Nonsense.

884
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,800
If I'm talking nonsense, you can test him.

885
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,600
Now Chief Guardian is outside.

886
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,800
He can compete with Mr. Xia.

887
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,330
Then you’ll know the truth.

888
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,080
I'm here today

889
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,390
to congratulate you sincerely.

890
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,760
How could I hope my cousin

891
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,010
and her husband don't get along

892
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,520
as soon as she gets married?

893
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,560
What do you want?

894
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,800
Just say it.

895
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,800
It’s easy.

896
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,560
Today,

897
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,630
I brought Yuwen Muyuan here

898
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,950
to help you

899
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,800
deal with Hall of Flames.

900
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,120
As soon as you speak,

901
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,120
the imperial guards will retreat.

902
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,930
And I will not spread

903
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,880
the information about Mr. Xia.

904
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,150
Hall of Flames

905
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,280
will be taken over by Yuwen Muyuan.

906
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,230
Sword Manor

907
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,800
can escape unscathed

908
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,030
from the chaotic situation.

909
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,390
Why don't you do it?

910
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Your Highness.

911
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,910
It seems that

912
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,390
I underestimated you.

913
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,630
You're not the only one

914
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,670
who underestimated me.

915
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,200
Mr. Lin, you stopped midway in your explanation.

916
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,800
I don't know what you are going to discuss

917
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,800
with your guests you invited to the Sword Manor.
