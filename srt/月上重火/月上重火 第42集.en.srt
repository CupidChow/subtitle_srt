Let me feed you.

5

Come on.

6
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,170
I’ve told you

7
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,560
I wouldn’t eat these things.

8
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,200
These...

9
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,730
These are all your favorite foods.

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,480
It’s sweet. Try it.

11
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,170
Don’t buy them for me again.

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,850
I bought you so many things,

13
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,060
yet you don’t want any of them.

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,079
Is it funny to be against me?

15
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,840
You got them by working for Lord Lu.

16
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,760
I won’t touch them.

17
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,040
What's wrong with working for Lord Lu?

18

I’ve learned the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

29

Even Shangguan Tou couldn’t beat me

33

34
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,240
By the way,

Shangguan Tou is dead!

39
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,760
He was killed by Yuwen Muyuan.

40

You’re sad, aren’t you?

41

Aren’t you sad?

I’m sad, too.

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
He shouldn’t have died so early.

44
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,560
He died early.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
I have no chance to prove I’m number one.

46

I haven’t beaten him. What should I do?

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
I want to

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,720
ask you a question about martial arts.

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,120
Go ahead, Your Highness.

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,370
There are numerous sects in the world,

67
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,250
and each has its own merits.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,360
I wonder

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,260
if there are good ones or bad ones.

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,880
As I know,

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,120
martial arts have no good ones or bad ones.

72
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
For instance,

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,960
a double-edged sword can both attack and defend,

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,820
yet it’s not as strong and powerful
as a broadsword.

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,400
For another instance,

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,760
fist skills are more offensive and direct,

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,440
while palm skills are more flexible

78
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
and effective.

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,880
Since they have no good ones or bad ones,

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,940
do they have strong ones or weak ones?

81
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,760
Martial arts

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
have no strong ones or weak ones as well,

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,920
yet martial artists

84
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,370
have strong ones and weak ones.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Muyuan.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,040
Looks like you didn’t get my meaning.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,480
I got it.

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,480
You’re asking

89
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,200
how martial arts counter each other.

90
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,280
Right?

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,000
Exactly.

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
For martial arts,

93
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,560
the speed matters the most.

94
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
As long as it's fast enough,

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
even ordinary moves can be

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,400
the most powerful martial arts in the world.

97
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
Perhaps that’s why Nine Moves of Lotus God

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,450
are overwhelming in the world.

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,970
Exactly.

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,720
The secret of Nine Moves of Lotus God

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
is

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,400
to gather all the inner power to one point,

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
which bursts out

104
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
while the moves

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
are made.

Do you know

108
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,890
how to counter Nine Moves of Lotus God?

109
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
To my knowledge,

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,520
no way.

111
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,480
I know an approach

112
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,060
that may counter Nine Moves of Lotus God.

These are Black Fires

possessed by imperial alchemists originally.

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
A unique function was found later.

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,900
So, Ministry of Industry hid them away secretly

119
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,280
for future wartime needs.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
But I secretly

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,320
stole the formula from the Ministry.

These...

124
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes.

125
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
These are common materials.

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,210
When they are combined,

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,610
they can get an unexpected effect.

128
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,810
The mixture of these materials

129
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
is highly flammable

130
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,700
and can generate tons of heat.

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,640
If sealed into a vessel like this,

132
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,930
it can produce a thunder-like effect.

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Yu Chuzhi is here.

177
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,480
Don’t you find

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,440
he is suspicious somewhat?

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,880
Suspicious?

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,600
No.

181
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,300
But I saw him enter the secret chamber today.

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,180
What are you doing?

183
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,540
It’s you, miss.

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,210
What are you doing here?

185
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
I saw many books here.

186
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
I didn’t know there’d be a library here.

187
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,140
So, I came to have a look

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,640
and borrow some books to read.

189
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
This isn’t a library.

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,450
Those are not books.

191
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
This room is...

192
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,420
You don't need to know.

193
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,410
Don’t stay here.

194
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Get out.

195
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
I’m ignorant.

196
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,440
My apology, miss.

197
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
I...

198
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,120
I’m leaving now.

199
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,280
Why did he go there?

200
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
He said

201
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
he mistook it as a library.

202
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
But I’m worried

203
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,300
he was a spy disguised by someone.

204
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,400
Disguised?

205
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
Really?

206
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
Even in disguise,

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,320
how could he

208
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,360
blatantly disguise as Shangguan Tou?

209
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,440
Father.

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,320
Father.

211
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,760
What brings you here?

212
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,400
Go inside and sit.

213
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,600
Sure.

214
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,880
I’m going to boil water.

215
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,440
No.

216
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,360
Fengzi. Sit.

217
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,840
Fengzi.

218
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Come back with me.

219
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,240
You need someone to take care of you.

220
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
I don’t feel at ease as you live here.

221
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,880
Father.

222
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,520
I'm already married.

223
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
This is my home now.

224
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,720
Home?

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,850
Look around.

226
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,560
Is it like a home?

227
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,960
Fengzi.

228
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,600
What did Xia Qingmei say to me

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
before you left Sword Manor?

230
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
He said he’d be good to you

231
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
and wouldn’t let you suffer.

232
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,840
He’d give you a better life than in Sword Manor.

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,930
Is this so-called better life?

234
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,800
Father.

235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,600
Calm down.

236
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,080
I’m living well.

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,840
Really.

238
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,200
We are not wealthy,

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,040
but Qingmei is very kind to me.

240
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,120
Father.

241
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:32,880
Look.

242
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,530
All of these were bought by Qingmei for me.

243
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,480
He is

244
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,020
reluctant to rely on Sword Manor.

245
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,210
He wants to prove

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
that he’s capable to take care of me.

247
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,160
I believe he can.

248
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,050
How about this, father?

249
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
When I feel better,

250
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,600
I’ll take him

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,080
to Sword Manor to visit you.

252
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,040
Alright?

253
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,160
Alright.

254
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,530
I will listen to you.

255
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,680
But

256
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,570
if you have any problem,

257
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
be sure to tell me.

258
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Don’t worry, father.

259
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
By the way, father,

260
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,460
you haven't eaten, right?

261
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,620
Stay here and have dinner with us.

262
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,920
I’m going to cook some dishes for you.

263
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,720
Yuwen Muyuan.

264
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,080
Don’t think just because you are backed by Lord Lu

265
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,600
That I dare not hurt you.

266
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,520
I’m backed by Lord Lu,

267
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,320
yet you are my senior.

268
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,770
You better know that Lord Lu values me.

269
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Now that you know,

270
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,960
how dare you be rude to me?

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
You’re mocking me?

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,160
Chief Feng.

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,080
I’m not mocking you at all.

274
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,360
You see

275
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,680
I have so much work to do today.

276
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,720
I really don’t have time for you.

277
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
You may go back, Chief Feng.

278
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,280
It’s said

279
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,450
that Lord Lu asked you to prepare Black Fires.

280
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,440
But

281
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,240
tomorrow he will hear of the news

282
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,380
that Muyuan made a mistake on Black Fires

283
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,320
and set the workshop on fire accidentally,

284
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,200
and

285
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
he’s burnt to death as well.

286
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,680
Chief Feng.

287
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,760
You want to kill me,

288
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,589
yet you’re afraid Lord Lu will know it.

289
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,109
Looks like

290
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,319
you’re not daring to take the consequence.

291
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,760
Consequence?

292
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,900
Do you have nerve to talk about consequence?

293
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,720
You killed my father!

294
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,680
If you dare to take the consequence,

295
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,140
you should kill yourself now for your guilt!

296
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,800
You think too much, Chief Feng.

297
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
Your father

298
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,440
deserved his death.

299
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
Yuwen Muyuan!

300
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,640
-You...
-Chief Feng.

301
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,840
Think about it.

302
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
You’re in Xiangzhou,

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
not in your Huashan Sect.

304
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Behave yourself.

305
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
You have no right

306
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,640
to order me around!

307
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,640
Do you know

308
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,520
what place this is?

309
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,360
What is it?

310
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,920
It’s nothing but a place

311
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
where you will burn to ashes with it!

312
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Looks like

313
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
you’re determined to make it hard on me.

314
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,600
Yuwen Muyuan.

315
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,760
You’ve been flaunting yourself lately.

316
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,810
I put up with it all the time.

317
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
Lord Lu is out today.

318
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
No one else will protect you.

319
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,840
You want to kill me.

320
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,000
It’s OK.

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,360
If His Highness’s plan is delayed due to this,

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,080
will you take the responsibility?

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,240
It’s just Black Fire.

324
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,300
You are not the only one

325
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
who can make it in the world!

326
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,240
I see.

327
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,720
You want to kill me

328
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,290
not to avenge your father’s death.

329
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,320
You’re just afraid I’ll steal your show

330
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,240
in front of His Highness.

331
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,480
Yuwen Muyuan.

332
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,720
You betrayed your sect.

333
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,520
You don’t deserve to be my equal.

334
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
No matter what,

335
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,200
I’ve never betrayed my sect.

336
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,560
Not like you.

337
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,330
To climb higher,

338
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,000
you even hurt

339
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
the woman you loved.

340
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,880
Chong Xuezhi is your leader.

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
She is still alive

342
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,480
and you’re eager to set up your own sect.

343
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,820
You’re right, Chief Feng.

344
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,160
Compared to you,

345
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,040
I’m much inferior.

346
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,160
Because I’m not capable

347
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
to take all the disciples of my sect

348
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,920
to enjoy the glory and wealth under Lord Lu.

349
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
Chief Guardian Muyuan

350
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,280
is such a traitor and lackey

351
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,680
who justifies himself well.

352
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,720
It’s lucky of you

353
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,450
that you were not killed

354
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,280
by the stones that day.

355
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,160
Excuse me?

356
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,410
Chief Guardian Muyuan.

357
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,960
You’re so forgetful.

358
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,860
Don’t you remember

359
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,480
the day when you delivered the Mo Knives?

360
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,200
How bold!

361
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
What the heck are you doing here?

362
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,780
Your Highness.

363
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
Muyuan killed my father.

364
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
I have to revenge,

365
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,380
or I feel ashamed to face my father in heaven.

366
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
So, I meant to duel with him.

367
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,680
Chief Feng.

368
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,970
Have you forgotten what I told you?

369
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,340
Sorry, Your Highness.

370
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Chief Feng, rise.

371
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,880
You’re both my right-hand men.

372
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,280
You’re ought to live in harmony.

373
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
The Sects Alliance was just founded.

374
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,880
We still have enemies there.

375
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
How could you fight with each other?

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
If you fight,

377
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,840
one will die and the other will be hurt.

378
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,440
I will not let that happen.

379
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,320
Muyuan.

380
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,000
You may leave.

381
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Yes.

382
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,680
Chief Feng.

383
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,480
I ordered Yuwen Muyuan

384
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,420
to prepare the Black Fire.

385
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,360
I hope you know it’s public business.

386
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,320
I got the news just now

387
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,300
that Chong Xuezhi is in Winehouse of Fairyland.

388
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
I hope you can

389
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,280
kill her

390
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
for me.

391
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,400
I know

392
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
you aren’t her match.

393
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,440
But I’ll send my men to help you.

394
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,760
They’re Warriors in Black I hired
from a foreign land.

395
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,420
Their unique martial arts

396
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,760
can counter Chong Xuezhi’s Nine Moves.

397
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,400
Plus,

398
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,680
I got you a trump card.

399
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,560
Hongxiu.

400
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,160
What are these fans for?

401
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,400
They are my gifts to customers.

402
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
Most of my customers

403
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,280
are scholars.

404
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
These people

405
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,930
like holding something in hand

406
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
to match their grace.

407
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,640
So, fans

408
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,250
are perfect gifts for them.

409
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,970
Younger sister,

410
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,610
What’s on your mind?

411
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,360
It occurred to me that

412
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
I didn’t give any gift

413
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,480
to Tou when he was with me.

414
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,240
Do you feel

415
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
it’s a shame?

416
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,360
Things we missed in life

417
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,480
were long gone.

418
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,800
I’m afraid I can no longer

419
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,580
have a chance to feel that.

420
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Not exactly.

421
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,640
At least,

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you understand it more than ever.

423
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,200
Hongxiu.

424
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,570
In your opinion,

425
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
what kind of fan does Mr. Yu like?

426
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,000
You want to give him a fan?

427
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Are you still testing his identity?

428
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,800
No.

429
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,560
I know he isn’t Tou.

430
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,760
Since you know he isn’t,

431
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,240
how do you know he likes fans?

432
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,200
He sent me back that day.

433
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I think

434
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,080
I should thank him.

435
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,020
So, you want to give him a gift?

436
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,520
I’m afraid he’s picky about fan faces.

437
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,210
I don’t think he likes the fan faces

438
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,920
made by ordinary craftsmen.

439
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,040
Since you can’t decide,

440
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
you may give him this fan frame.

441
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
He can make decision

442
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
about what he likes.

443
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,160
Good idea.

444
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,840
Please do me the favor

445
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,620
and give him the fan frame.

446
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,740
What are you doing thinking all by yourself?

447
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,520
Why bother doing this?

448
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Why don’t you tell her directly?

449
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,080
She is smart.

450
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,420
She’ll figure it out sooner or later.

451
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,000
Hongxiu.

452
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,200
I can’t tell her the truth.

453
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,520
If Xue Lie knows I’m still alive,

454
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
he will kill me

455
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,680
and all the people I care about.

456
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,600
My sister is dead.

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,080
Xue Lie hates me.

458
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,560
He is capable of anything.

459
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,720
I can’t let Xuezhi

460
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,360
be in danger again because of me.

461
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
But since Xuezhi believes you’re dead,

462
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,730
She’s been thinking how to avenge your death.

463
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,240
Isn’t it more dangerous for her?

464
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,960
I thought Mr. Lin could make her

465
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,680
let go of the grudge temporarily.

466
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I didn’t think...

467
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,680
You don’t think anyone can stop her.

468
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,320
Tou.

469
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,280
Ask yourself.

470
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,640
If it was Xuezhi

471
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,040
who fell off the cliff,

472
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,330
would you worry about yourself

473
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,760
and not avenge her death?

474
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,020
I really don’t know

475
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,680
you want to protect her

476
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,800
or hurt her?

477
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Tou.

478
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,920
I’m tired of keeping the secret for you.

479
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,920
I’m afraid

480
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,450
I might say something wrong

481
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
and eventually give you away

482
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,290
Thank you, Hongxiu.

483
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,100
I have information

484
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,160
about what you asked me to find out.

485
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,920
It’s true that some disciples of Hall of Flames

486
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,450
were hiding in Sword Manor.

487
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,640
But it’s weird

488
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,170
that after Lin Fengzi got married,

489
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,120
these disciples went missing.

490
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,850
The Crown Prince

491
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,160
wants me to figure out Xue Lie’s scheme.

492
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,920
But

493
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,360
Xue Lie, while appearing to be transparent

494
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,280
Is actually underhandedly planning.

495
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,610
Epidemic. Wiping out the Hall of Flames.
Killing my father.

496
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,480
He was behind all of it.

497
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,560
But with each case,

498
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,520
no evidence can be found related to him.

499
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,200
It’s extremely difficult to find clues

500
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,920
connecting him.

501
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,520
I want to

502
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,900
start investigating the people around him.

503
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,840
You mean

504
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,960
Yuwen Muyuan?

505
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,080
I’ve been wondering

506
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,120
why Yuwen Muyuan joined Xue Lie so suddenly.

507
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
It’s possible

508
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,570
that he lost his mind because he failed

509
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,280
to win Xuezhi’s heart,

510
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,360
I will never believe that.

511
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,320
I don’t like him,

512
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,520
but

513
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
I can’t believe

514
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,720
he would do a thing like that.

515
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,760
If

516
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,240
he made such a risky move

517
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,490
just to get the Hall of Flames back,

518
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,240
using Xue Lie,

519
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,160
that is possible.

520
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,640
You mean

521
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
the disciples hiding in Sword Manor

522
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,840
were taken away by Xue Lie’s men?

523
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,140
Except for Xue Lie,

524
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,840
who else could have done it so quietly

525
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,010
without a trace?

526
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,740
Even Leader Lin didn't say a word.

527
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,130
It looks like

528
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,520
these disciples

529
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,280
are gifts

530
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,720
given by Xue Lie

531
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,680
to Yuwen Muyuan, the new leader.

532
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,610
What are you going to do?

533
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,860
Currently,

534
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,640
Xue Lie alone is formidable enough.

535
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,040
If Yuwen Muyuan gets stronger,

536
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,280
we

537
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,400
don’t stand a chance at all.

538
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I’m going to Xiangzhou for a few days

539
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,380
At present,

540
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
Sects Alliance is already causing chaos.

541
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,200
I think

542
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,320
only by getting to them can I figure it out.

543
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,600
Also,

544
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,960
the Hall of Flames is very important to Xuezhi.

545
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,080
I will surely

546
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,000
get it back for her.

547
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,760
Tou.

548
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,080
You are important to Xuezhi, too.

549
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,720
Take it.

550
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,760
This is Xuezhi’s gift

551
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
to Yu Chuzhi.

552
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,200
Mr. Yu.

553
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,520
Thanks for your gift.

554
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,960
It’s just that

555
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
I don’t know

556
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,720
why you gave me a gift.

557
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,560
It means nothing, actually.

558
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,680
I just don't want to be in your debt.

559
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,800
You were drunk that day

560
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,560
and

561
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,440
called out the name Shangguan Tou repeatedly.

562
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,920
Can you tell me

563
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,920
your relationship

564
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,960
with him?

565
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,840
My relationship

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,400
with him

567
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,560
is a long story.

568
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,520
Can you tell me

569
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,480
where he is now?

570
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,400
He is dead.

571
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,920
So,

572
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,120
you’re burning

573
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,120
paper money for him

574
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
at this hour.

575
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,120
It’s also for another important official,

576
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,280
who was a respected elder.

577
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,520
He was loyal,

578
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,850
yet was wrongly accused and executed.

579
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,200
I watched the tragedy happen,

580
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,570
yet I couldn’t do anything.

581
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
There's another

582
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,880
gorgeous woman

583
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,880
of noble rank

584
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,920
She thought

585
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,160
married the man she loved.

586
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,120
But discovered, that he is a vicious snake.

587
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,200
After a few years of blissful illusion,

588
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,480
she and her unborn child

589
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,640
died with regrets.

590
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
These

591
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,240
are burned for myself.

592
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,680
Miss.

593
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,920
Why do you say so?

594
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,280
Mr. Yu.

595
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,640
I have a request.

596
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,520
Maybe this request is kind of hard

597
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,440
for you.

598
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,920
But I hope

599
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,240
you can call me Xuezhi.

600
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,040
Why do you have such a request?

601
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,720
Because that's how

602
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,760
Tou called me.

603
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,360
I don't know if there's afterlife.

604
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,840
I don’t know

605
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,200
if I can meet him in the other world, either.

606
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,840
If I can’t,

607
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
I hope when I’m alive

608
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,320
I can hear him call my name again.

609
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,400
I know he is already dead.

610
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,000
But I have no way to let him go.

611
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,120
Do you know how happy

612
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,200
I was when I saw you on the bridge

613
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,560
that day?

614
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,960
At that moment,

615
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,760
I thought he came back.

616
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,600
You may think I’m deluding myself.

617
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,080
But

618
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,280
I do hope

619
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,840
you can grant my request.

620
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,630
Miss.

621
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,650
I don’t know what you've been through.

622
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,560
But

623
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,760
I believe

624
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,000
if that Shangguan knew,

625
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,760
he wouldn’t want you to do these things

626
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,670
and suffer.

627
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,920
I can’t grant your request.

628
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,640
Miss,

629
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,040
don’t say these sad words.

630
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,080
Do you have someone you love?

631
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,560
If you

632
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,040
love someone,

633
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,200
you would understand me.

634
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Sorry.

635
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,000
I missed him so much that night.

636
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,720
So, I mistook you as him.

637
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,360
You tell me

638
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,440
If he knew

639
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,040
I mistook you as him,

640
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,200
would he be unhappy?

641
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
He is gone.

642
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,080
Even the most beautiful view

643
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,120
in the world

644
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,320
is colorless

645
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
in my eyes.

646
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,520
Just like this,

647
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,800
he watched me

648
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
as you do,

649
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,840
the same way you’re looking at me.

650
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
Don’t worry.

651
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,200
I won’t commit suicide.

652
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,000
He died for no reason.

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,260
I haven’t avenged him.

654
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,640
I surely will kill his enemy for him

655
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,960
to console his sister and father in heaven,

656
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,680
to let him rest in peace.

657
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,440
Miss.

658
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,000
You’re young.

659
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,530
Can you shoulder a huge feud like this?

660
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,880
I can’t

661
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,800
marry him this life,

662
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,720
but I’ve seen him as my family all the time.

663
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,680
His father and sister

664
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,840
are also my family.

665
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,520
Avenging for my family,

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,080
how can I not do it?

667
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,040
I’m sorry

668
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
for my rudeness.

669
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,440
Miss.

670
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,280
Sorry.

671
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,720
I didn’t grant your request.

672
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,360
I should say sorry to you.

673
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,240
I'm leaving soon.

674
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,500
When all of this is gone with the wind,

675
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,080
all regrets

676
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,680
will be gone as well.

677
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
This red string

678
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,920
was tied by him for me when he left.

679
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,440
He said

680
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,240
bound by this red line,

681
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,600
he would miss me and come back very soon.

682
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
But now he's gone.

683
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,800
Let this red line

684
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,080
lead me

685
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
to him.

686
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,160
Miss.

687
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,840
Do you have to go?

688
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,040
Yes.

689
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,120
I have to.

690
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
You go to revenge rashly.

691
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,370
You’ll be in danger.

692
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,160
Think about it.

693
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If that Shangguan were still alive,

694
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,560
would he wish you to go?

695
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,840
Yeah.

696
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,240
He never wanted me to take any risk.

697
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,720
Every time there was danger,

698
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,840
he kept me away, stopped me,

699
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,680
and shouldered it alone.

700
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,680
For me,

701
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,120
he could forsake everything.

702
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,520
For me,

703
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,840
he could

704
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,400
bear everything.

705
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,200
But now,

706
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,880
he can’t stop me anymore.

707
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,680
Mr. Yu, goodbye.

708
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,330
You should have been killed

709
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,280
by the stones that day.

710
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,520
Commander.

711
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,320
We were attacked on the road.

712
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,640
The rest of Mo Knives were robbed.

713
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,680
Soldiers!

714
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,360
You failed to complete the military order.

715
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,290
You will be punished accordingly.

716
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,520
Chong Xuezhi, the Leader of Hall of Flames,

717
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,080
Muyuan, Chief Guardian, failed their duty,

718
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,680
lost imperial weapons and violated military law.

719
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,210
They’ll be executed today.

720
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,560
Their property, the Hall of Flames
is confiscated.

721
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,000
From today on,

722
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,960
this domain is

723
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,380
[The Hall of Flames]

724
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,040
governed by the Commander-in-chief.
