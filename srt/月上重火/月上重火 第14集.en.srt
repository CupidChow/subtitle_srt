00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 14

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,030
Where were you

5
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,630
when I despaired

6
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,960
the whole world?

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,370
Where were you then?

8
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,240
You were lost in the glory and wealth

9
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,630
at your honorable position

10
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,440
Tou,

11
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,550
I’m not a good father.

12
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,800
Not a good husband either.

13
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,520
Power…

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
Power is a mire.

15
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
One step into it

16
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,560
and you’ll never get out.

17
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,630
This wound in my heart

18
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,910
is like a fire.

19
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,030
Every day,

20
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,320
every second,

21
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,670
it is burning me

22
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,520
like hell.

23
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,960
Family…

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,270
How precious it is

25
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,320
among all other things in the world!

26
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,470
But I discarded it,

27
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,750
and volunteered to be the victim of power.

28
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,440
I…

29
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,390
I just couldn’t escape.

30
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,110
Oh, save it.

31
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
You sacrificed the woman

32
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,550
who loved you with her life to power

33
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,340
in exchange for your own rank and wealth.

34
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,750
She ended up

35
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
losing her life

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,550
because you’d broken your vows.

37
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,950
How dare you

38
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,640
talk about redemption, you hypocrite!

39
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I did think about redemption.

40
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,880
But my way of redemption

41
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,160
didn’t help.

42
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,550
In the past years,

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,920
everything I have done

44
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,040
is for making up for my mistake.

45
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,200
But

46
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
you know what?

47
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,110
My mistake had grown so big

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,440
that it then became

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
beyond remedy.

50
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,480
I had no choice but to hide it from you.

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,600
Tou,

52
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,110
remember that I held you in my arms

53
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,510
for a long time

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,040
before I saw you off the other day?

55
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,950
That’s because I feared that

56
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,790
I’d never see you again,

57
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,790
once I let go of you.

58
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,840
These are the shoes your mother made for you

59
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,780
when she was carrying you.

60
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,270
They are

61
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,670
all I was left with to remind me

62
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
of you.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,110
I have already

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,920
lost your mother.

65
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
I can’t afford to lose you either.

66
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,440
Tou,

67
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,040
I don’t really know

68
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,350
how should I

69
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,390
face you.

70
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,830
Then don’t bother.

71
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,400
Tou.

72
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,030
Tou.

73
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,320
I’m here because

74
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,400
I’ve heard of

75
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,980
your quarrel with Father.

76
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,400
So you’re here to give me a lecture?

77
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,040
Can you just forgive him

78
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,110
for my sake?

79
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,960
Zheng,

80
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,300
you’ve long known about this,

81
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:11,840
right?

82
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,590
Tou,

83
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,840
I’ve always seen you as my dearest brother.

84
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,720
Though we have different mothers,

85
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,400
we grew up together

86
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,030
under the same roof.

87
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,550
And we share one father.

88
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,760
sister,

89
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
you know what?

90
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,280
I envied you when we were children.

91
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,950
I didn’t know what I’d done wrong

92
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,320
to make them treat me like that.

93
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,960
I worked so hard.

94
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,600
How I wished them to treat me the way they treated you.

95
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,670
But then?

96
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,790
I didn’t know what to do at the end of the day.

97
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,550
Tou,

98
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,110
you’ve done nothing wrong.

99
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,240
You might just

100
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,710
misunderstand Mother in some way.

101
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,760
I know for sure

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,330
that she’s never blamed you for anything.

103
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,250
The one she truly hated was Father.

104
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,790
Your mother wasn’t

105
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,790
the only one that got hurt by Father.

106
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,440
And after all these years,

107
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,500
Mother has decided to forgive him

108
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
and accept you as her family.

109
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,710
I won’t forgive

110
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
a treacherous man.

111
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,110
Tou,

112
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,840
what can I do

113
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,150
to get you back home?

114
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,670
Zheng,

115
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,560
all I want is to live on my own.

116
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,850
I know you’ve been treated unfairly.

117
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,890
I won’t force you to make a choice.

118
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
But remember,

119
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
Father is protecting you.

120
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,590
Young Master,

121
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,170
be careful when practicing martial arts.

122
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,470
Because no one will heal you if you’re injured

123
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,440
when I’m not here.

124
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,350
Young Master,

125
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,880
take good care of yourself.

126
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,110
I’ve prepared staple food,

127
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,710
and meat.

128
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
Eat on time, will you?

129
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,080
Don’t work too hard.

130
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,440
Drop it if it’s too much for you.

131
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,550
OK, I get it.

132
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,790
Stop gabbing.

133
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,710
Young Master,

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
I promise you

135
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,820
I’ll put the Hall in perfect order

136
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,400
during your closed-door study.

137
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,740
This is the last time I call you Young Master.

138
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,810
Because when you come out,

139
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,110
you’ll be

140
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,090
the official Leader of the Hall of Flames.

141
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,670
Also,

142
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,000
may the late Leader

143
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,580
Chong Ye bless you.

144
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,520
See you then.

145
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,080
Young Master.

146
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
This is your food.

147
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,230
Young Master.

148
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,030
The quilt and clothes are ready.

149
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,880
Careful.

150
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,200
Mr. Hong,

151
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,640
you were severely injured.

152
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,130
I don’t think you should move.

153
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I’ve got some food for you.

154
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,110
Why did you save me?

155
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,880
A righteous martial man

156
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,450
should always lend a helping hand

157
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,960
to those in danger.

158
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,880
I don’t buy that.

159
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,910
You are not the first man

160
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,710
I’ve seen who brags

161
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,150
about being righteous.

162
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Mr. Xia,

163
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,310
you don’t strike me as a fool.

164
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,200
Just save the nonsense

165
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,790
and tell me the truth.

166
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,520
Mr. Hong,

167
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,280
I want you

168
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,110
to teach me the Nine Moves.

169
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,520
The Nine Moves. I knew it.

170
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,470
I didn’t expect

171
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,670
Mr. Xia Qingmei from the respected Sword Manor

172
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,030
would covet the evil art from the Hall of Flames

173
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,470
just like anybody else.

174
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,880
Evil art?

175
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
It depends on who the learner is.

176
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,280
Every martial art is evil

177
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,490
if practiced by an evil person.

178
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,230
I want to learn it

179
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,520
because

180
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,470
I want to enhance my competency.

181
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,790
I’m not like all those rascals out there.

182
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Everyone knows

183
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,320
the Nine Moves is a once-in-a-blue-moon art.

184
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,460
If I get to learn it,

185
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,030
plus the Sword Manor’s reputation,

186
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,080
I’ll rule the world.

187
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,760
Exactly.

188
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,550
Who will resist such a

189
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,470
once-in-a-life-time chance?

190
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,840
Never mind.

191
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,840
I’m almost wasted now.

192
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,470
Even if I’m recovered,

193
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,360
I won’t be able to practice martial arts again.

194
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,030
I’ll just

195
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,950
impart to you the Nine Moves

196
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
so that I’ll get to see with my eyes

197
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,589
how invincible this art is

198
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,470
to make everyone

199
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,880
scramble for it.

200
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,410
Thank you, Mr. Hong.

201
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,110
The new weapons are more lethal than before.

202
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,590
I specially designed a hollow on it.

203
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,950
So that when stabbed by it,

204
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,810
the enemies won’t stop bleeding.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Very good.

206
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,470
Ever since the Weapon Ranking Convention,

207
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,870
all schools have stopped

208
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,480
purchasing weapons from us.

209
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,880
However, the purchase from the government

210
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,160
has doubled in order to

211
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
fight against the invaders.

212
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,160
We must deliver

213
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,230
the weapons on time

214
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,800
to cover our last year’s expense.

215
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,430
Don’t worry, Chief Guardian.

216
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,490
Keep working hard.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Stretch your arms.

218
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
Keep your half squat stable.

219
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,760
Go on.

220
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,830
I thought you’ll stay in the Imperial Advisor’s place

221
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,560
after you knew about your past.

222
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
I will never take another step there

223
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,090
since I know I don’t belong there.

224
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,110
My father sent me away

225
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,110
so that Mo…

226
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,090
Mrs. Shangguan would not need to stay with me.

227
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,640
Don’t put him into a dilemma.

228
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,470
You seem to be even more confused

229
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,520
after knowing your history.

230
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,230
Master,

231
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
what about me going with you to

232
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
the Winehouse of Fairyland for some music

233
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,350
and fun?

234
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
It’s you who want to go there, right?

235
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,870
I’m worrying about you, Master.

236
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,470
I want to distract you from depression

237
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,560
and annoyance.

238
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,040
Can you swear that you have never

239
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,810
felt for me even for a second

240
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,350
from the very beginning?

241
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,890
A simple “yes” from you,

242
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,490
and I’ll let the bygones be bygones

243
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,550
and won’t annoy you anymore.

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Indeed.

245
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,600
I do feel depressed.

246
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,270
I used to believe that

247
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
music and alcohol

248
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,950
can solve any problems in the world.

249
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,590
But then,

250
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,710
alcohol can only save you

251
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,950
from agony for a while

252
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,890
by taking away your soberness.

253
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
And music won’t make you any happier

254
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,490
but help you present a false outer peace.

255
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,110
Anyway,

256
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,880
it’s nothing but a temporary evasion.

257
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,350
We won’t need to go to

258
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,230
the Winehouse of Fairyland

259
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,640
if you’ve thought everything through.

260
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
No place is better than the Moon Valley

261
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,760
for Master to contemplate

262
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,890
as we have fresh air,

263
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,610
fragrance of flowers, and sound of nature here.

264
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,640
We have wine that

265
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,070
will never run out.

266
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,590
Come and

267
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,680
try my plum wine.

268
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,560
Can you smell the sweetness of plum

269
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,290
and the mellowness of alcohol?

270
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,830
I said

271
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,240
earlier during the daytime

272
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,590
that drinking was but a temporary evasion.

273
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,450
And look what I’m doing now.

274
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,470
Ridiculous.

275
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,520
Tou,

276
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,680
you really think drinking is a temporary evasion?

277
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,110
People say

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,110
the Moon Valley is an Eden.

279
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,760
They all scramble for coming here.

280
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,370
But that’s also an evasion, isn’t it?

281
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
But what can I do now

282
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,440
apart from evasion?

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,710
Tou,

284
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,720
you’ll come around some day

285
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,810
that an evasion

286
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,190
is of no use.

287
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,480
You are the son

288
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,320
of the Imperial Advisor.

289
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,160
It’s impossible for you

290
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,710
to live a care-free life

291
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,160
like I do.

292
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,430
Mr. Lin,

293
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,160
I just don’t understand.

294
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,110
What on earth

295
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,880
is my father after?

296
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,440
Forgiveness.

297
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,270
Just like your father, you won’t

298
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,510
forgive yourself for the rest of your life.

299
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,760
Why did he send me to the Sword Manor

300
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,280
and avoid me for a long time?

301
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,900
You should confront him yourself

302
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,350
for all these questions you have.

303
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,520
Listen,

304
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,960
hatred and complaint

305
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,680
can bring you nothing but torture.

306
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,540
You won’t get your answers there.

307
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,190
Remember,

308
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,710
an apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

309
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,710
You have to know about your father first

310
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,640
before you can know about yourself.

311
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,710
Both his good sides

312
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,750
and bad sides.

313
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,110
Well,

314
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,830
I prefer to drink alone.

315
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,760
Sleep on it.

316
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,230
These are the shoes your mother made for you

317
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,170
when she was carrying you.

318
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,590
They are

319
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,190
all I was left with to remind me

320
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,160
of you.

321
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,400
I have already

322
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,310
lost your mother.

323
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,350
I can’t afford to lose you either.

[Take in the drips around a waterfall,

325
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,400
Tou,

326
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,880
you know what a “gem” is?

327
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,070
I know.

328
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,830
“Gem” means fine jade.

329
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,400
There are lines in the Songs of Chu that read

330
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:56,060
[Take in the drips around a waterfall,
and keep the essence of a gem.]

331
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,830
“Take in the drips around a waterfall,

332

and keep the essence of a gem.”

333
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,070
Gem is used as a metaphor for a gentleman’s virtue.

and grow stronger.

337
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,560
When I become invincible,

338
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,520

339
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,140
you won’t dare to rise up against me then.

has made bigger progress? Me or Chequ?

345
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,470
From my perspective,

346
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,400
Chequ’s making greater progress.

347
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,590
That’s not possible.

348
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,310
Why?

349
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,560
He didn’t exert his full strength yet,

350
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,820
but you ended in a draw.

351
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,680
I don’t believe this.

352
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,540
Get up. We’ll have another round.

353
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Leave me alone.

354
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,950
Get up. You won’t defeat me anyway.

355
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,760
-I can’t defeat you?
-Enough.

356
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,830
You do this tomorrow.

357
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,760
Chief Guardian still need us to supervise the forge of weapons, right?

358
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,400
Speaking of him,

359
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,000
he’s been

360
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,230
pulling a long face lately.

361
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,300
Something must be on his mind.

362
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,730
I haven’t seen him smile

363
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,400
ever since Young Master started her closed-door study.

364
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,000
Exactly.

365
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,280
Young Master has been there

366
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,610
for almost a whole year.

367
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,230
I wonder

368
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,520
how she’s doing inside.

369
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,230
Xuezhi,

370
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,250
it’s been almost a year.

371
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
How are you doing?

372
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,290
I’ve realized my promise to you

373
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,000
and have kept the Hall in perfect order.

374
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,280
It’s a pity that I can’t help you now.

375
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,360
You must keep pushing yourself.

376
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,000
I want to be proud of you

377
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,040
when you come out.

378
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,340
[The Luduan Temple]

379
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,350
Abbot Shiyan,

380
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,560
for what do you

381
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,920
gather us here?

382
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
That’s textbook.

383
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,520
The plague is rampaging.

384
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,430
He must be calling us here for solutions.

385
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,070
Doctor.

386
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,800
Doctor.

387
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,830
Doctor.

388
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,800
Doctor.

389
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,830
Please, save her!

390
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,590
But

391
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,920
it’s of no use to come to me.

392
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,040
I don’t know how

393
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,430
to treat this flu.

394
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,400
Everyone,

395
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,680
the plague is rampaging.

396
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,920
Apart from plain people,

397
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
Save me!

398
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,070
many martial men

399
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,470
have fallen ill too.

400
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,590
Normal doctors are unable to treat them.

401
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,000
I gather you here today

402
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,470
to see what solutions we can get

403
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,430
from a group of elites

404
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,310
to deal with this situation.

405
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,350
As you say,

406
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,190
the flu

407
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
is fierce,

408
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,590
and

409
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,160
its symptoms are abnormal.

410
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,760
The disease came from Anping County.

411
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,460
Then what does it have to do

412
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,230
with the rest of us?

413
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,800
Exactly.

414
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,430
That’s right.

415
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,710
That’s none of our business.

416
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,710
The Shark Sect

417
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,280
is in the south,

418
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,380
[Tie Xiao, Leader of the Shark Sect]

419
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,640
far apart from Anping County.

420
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,430
No matter how many people will fall ill here,

421
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,280
my people

422
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,760
won’t be infected anyway.

423
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,640
That’s right.

424
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,590
What does it have to do with us when the county

425
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,920
under the Hall of Flames is attacked by plague?

426
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,470
That’s right.

427
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,760
-exactly.
-That’s none of our business.

428
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,310
Right.

429
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,470
20 days ago,

430
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,720
The flu only existed in Anping County.

431
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,590
But now,

432
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,350
it has been found in 7 villages in the

433
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,040
3 counties near Anping.

434
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,150
It is said that

435
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,520
the flu is spread

436
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,190
by the patients who traveled.

437
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,760
It’s spreading rapidly.

438
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,760
Once a person catches the flu,
and the whole family will suffer.

439
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,389
Patients of this flu

440
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,320
feel hot for some time

441
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,520
and cold for another.

442
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,710
Then they can only remain on bed.

443
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,690
Many people can’t even make a living now,

444
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,150
let alone seeing a doctor.

445
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,560
Chief Guardian,

446
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,320
Anping County is right at the foot of our mountain.

447
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,280
I say we should not

448
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,080
go there these days.

449
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:42,389
As I remember,

450
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,389
most of our delivery men

451
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,840
come from Anping, right?

452
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,080
Can we

453
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,159
find some strong young men,

454
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,040
keep them at the foot of the mountain for a while,

455
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,430
and ask them to deliver the weapons

456
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,230
after making sure they’re fine?

457
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,780
That’s not a good idea.

458
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,810
Most of the young men in Anping

459
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,630
have helped us before.

460
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,810
As the plague is going rampant,

461
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,390
most families have been deprived of labors.

462
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,450
At a time like this,

463
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,620
we should be the ones to help them.

464
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,320
Listen.

465
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,470
You two go and prepare some solid food

466
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,150
and clothes

467
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,040
and hand out to them.

468
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,170
The more the better.

469
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,600
-Yes.
-Yes.

470
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,770
Chief Guardian,

471
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,450
what about the weapons?

472
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
I’ll handle this.

473
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,950
-OK.
-OK.

474
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,190
Where did the plague come from?

475
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,280
Anping County.

476
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,470
And who’s in charge of this place?

477
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,600
The Hall of Flames.

478
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,560
God is punishing the Hall of Flames

479
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,390
as He is furious about

480
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,470
all the evil things they have done.

481
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,710
Mr. Feng,

482
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,120
most of the residents in Anping

483
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,800
are ordinary people.

484
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,190
They’ve suffered enough

485
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,720
from the terrible disease.

486
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,320
Don’t you think you’re being too mean

487
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,320
to say this?

488
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,080
Besides,

489
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,360
Though Anping is the most severely afflicted area,

490
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,160
it’s not the only epidemic area.

491
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,600
Some villages at the foot of our mountain

492
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,150
are also affected.

493
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,800
Leader.

494
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,820
Leader.

495
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,360
Some of our disciples have been infected too.

496
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,120
What?

497
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,360
When?

498
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,390
About 4 days ago.

499
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,910
I have an emergency to deal with.

500
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,150
Please excuse me.

501
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,520
Goodbye.

502
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,040
What?

503
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,490
How could this happen?

504
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,320
Tell me about it.

505
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,720
Huashan is far away from the Hall of Flames.

506
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,080
The flu is spreading

507
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,320
much faster

508
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,910
and wider

509
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,190
than we’ve expected.

510
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Abbot Shiyan,

511
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,890
though we are good at making health products,

512
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,410
they are basically for health improvement.

513
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,390
I don’t think they can cure

514
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,150
the terrible disease.

515
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,000
That’s true.

516
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,670
The flu is so fierce

517
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,760
that it’s now beyond our ability

518
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,320
to control it.

519
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,130
Then what do you think, Abbot?

520
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,670
We need the government

521
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,670
to control such large-scale disease.

522
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,630
I will write a letter to the Imperial Advisor

523
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,600
and ask him

524
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,600
for help.

525
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,840
Thank you.

526
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,040
Zhusha.

527
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,670
Are these everything we’ve got?

528
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,780
We have more in the warehouse.

529
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,280
Another three trips of transportation will do.

530
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,950
But there are so many people here in Anping.

531
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,810
We won’t able to cover all of them.

532
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,710
But that’s all we’ve got now.

533
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

534
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,470
Thank you.

535
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,190
Zhusha.

536
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
That man’s with a saber.

537
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,470
Wait until it’s your turn.

538
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,190
Thank you.

539
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,120
Thank you.

540
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,890
They seem to be bandits.

541
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,200
Go tell Chief Guardian!

542
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,000
Emergency!

543
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,970
Chief Guardian!

544
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,600
Chief Guardian!

545
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,200
The bandits have come to rob.

546
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,950
Where are they?

547
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,870
On the plaza.

548
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,870
Go.

549
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:34,760
Retreat.

550
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,760
Hurry up!

551
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,000
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

552
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,710
Muyuan.

553
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,080
It’s been a year.

554
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,640
You must have had a hard time.

555
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,190
Young Master.

556
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,040
You have made incredible progress

557
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,240
in your martial arts.

558
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,430
Exactly!

559
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,120
What have you got

560
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,120
from your closed-door study?

561
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,630
I’ve started the Lotus Wing,

562
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,430
but I’ve only reached the fifth move.

563
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,360
I’ve already tried my best.

564
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,990
But if I want to break it through,

565
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,450
I must work even harder.

566
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,280
That’s right, Leader.

567
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,320
The study of martial arts

568
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,710
is a life-long process.

569
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,700
You won’t just make it overnight.

570
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
Thank you for your teaching, Elder.

571
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,560
Leader,

572
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,560
you’re already kicking ass when you reach the fifth.

573
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,690
What will you be like

574
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,110
when you reach the ninth?

575
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,950
I really look forward to seeing you practice the ninth!

576
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,360
If you ask me,

577
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,420
I want her to never use the ninth move.

578
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,330
What Elder Yuwen means is that

579
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,620
he wants you to save your strength

580
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,320
to prevent troubles from other sects.

581
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,630
Tell me,

582
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,390
why did the bandits

583
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,000
want our food and clothes?

584
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,710
Leader,

585
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,430
you’ve been keeping yourself from the outside

586
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,080
so of course you don’t know what happened.

587
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,210
In the past 2 months,

588
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,280
Anping County and areas around

589
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,880
have been afflicted by a flu.

590
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,610
Many people have suffered.

591
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,040
So Chief Guardian asked us

592
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,710
to hand out the supplies to them.

593
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,150
Then the bandits heard of this somehow

594
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,520
and came to rob us.

595
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,600
So the flu

596
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,150
is to blame.

597
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,470
We need to be more careful.

598
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,280
You’re right.

599
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,120
The disease has become more rampant day by day.

600
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,180
Many villages have turned desolate.

601
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,090
Tombs are being built everywhere in the mountains.

602
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:16,910
We have close relations with

603
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,630
the residents around.

604
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,390
We can’t just look on when

605
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,360
they are suffering from the disease.

606
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,520
Otherwise we’ll be affected too.

607
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,800
Liuli,

608
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,710
you know about medicine.

609
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,520
Will you come with me

610
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,000
to find the therapy of the flu?

611
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,760
I will.

612
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,000
Leader,

613
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,260
we’d love to come, too.

614
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,670
Leader, you just came out from your study.

615
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,270
You should prioritize the affairs of the Hall.

616
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,600
In fact,

617
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,000
the residents around us

618
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,280
is also of our concern.

619
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,670
Solving their problems will be

620
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,570
helping ourselves as well.

621
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,960
I agree with Elder Yuchi.

622
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,980
The benevolent

623
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,370
should care about all people in the world.

624
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,430
But don’t worry too much, Elder Yuwen.

625
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,360
Now the top event of the Hall

626
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,150
is the delivery of the weapons.

627
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
And I’ll deal with it.

628
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,230
Leader,

629
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,600
Chequ and I

630
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,390
will go deliver some of the weapons first

631
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,120
and then we’ll come to join you.

632
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,320
Good.

633
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,670
Abbot Shiyan from Luduan Temple sent a letter here.

634
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,600
He said many places in the north are attacked by a flu.

635
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,730
He asked the government for help.

636
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,730
Imperial Advisor.

637
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,540
During my inspection to the north this time,

638
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,080
I witnessed families

639
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,950
being dying out

640
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,320
because of the disease.

641
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,520
It was horrible.

642
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,040
But we are having the Heaven Worship Ceremony soon,

643
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,080
and I am the person in charge.

644
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,810
I won’t be able to handle this at the same time.

645
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,520
Then,

646
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
I’ll take up this responsibility for you.
