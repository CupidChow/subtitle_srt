And The Winner is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 6

4
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Anyone?

5
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,270
Anyone?

6
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,960
Let us out.

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,630
How can you put us in jail

8
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,829
since you haven’t checked it properly?

9
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,520
Anyone?

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,520
Zhusha.

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,270
Stop it.

12
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,000
Save some energy.

13
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,240
Anyone?

14
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
Anyone?

15
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,160
Stop it. Zhusha.

16
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,670
It doesn’t work.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Anyone?

18
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,270
Young Master.

19
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,880
This magistrate

20
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,079
is just bad like Wang Yinya.

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,470
I don’t know if

22
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,270
Muyuan has returned safely.

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Don’t be worried.

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,000
Chief Guardian has superior martial arts.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,440
Nobody can hurt him.

26
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,770
I believe he has reached the Hall.

27
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,240
Everyone.

28
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,050
The magistrate invited you to the main court.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,270
You can go now.

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,550
You can go now.

31
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,329
There’s one there.

32
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,550
I’m being careless

33
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,030
and didn’t know your identity.

34
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,030
Please forgive me.

35
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,630
Never mind.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,079
You are busy with your job,

37
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,970
it’s normal to forget something.

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,440
But I hope you can check carefully

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,750
if you investigate into anything.

40
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,030
Don’t listen to

41
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,320
others’ bare words.

42
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,829
Yes,

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
I will remember that.

44
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,240
Let’s eat.

45
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,270
Come on.

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,030
A chicken leg.

47
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,440
Here.

48
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,670
I’ve understood now.

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,910
When explaining does not work,

50
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,670
we should resort to actions.

51
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,030
You’re more mature

52
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,080
than before.

53
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,390
Of course, I am.

54
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,470
You guys are with me every day,

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,270
I should progress quickly.

56
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,070
Young Master.

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,160
Gugu is missing.

58
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,790
Disappeared?

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
I haven’t seen him

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,670
for a while.

61
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,830
Yeah.

62
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,320
I haven’t since we came back from the jail.

63
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
He’s not in the room.

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,350
Was he taken by people
from Silver Whip School?

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,210
Yeah. They have been watching us.

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,510
Hurry up.

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,940
Notify Shangguan.

68
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Young Master.

69
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,640
This is a branch of Silver Whip School.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,550
Watch out.

71
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
Gugu might be inside.

72
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
Nine Moves again.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,830
Nine Moves?

74
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,320
How would this happen?

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
Were they done by one person?

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,350
They died not long ago.

77
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,110
Go inside.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,480
Watch out.

79
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,390
Xuezhi.

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,880
Gugu.

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,350
Xuezhi.

82
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,170
How are you? What happened?

83
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,350
I just saw a man in black

84
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,390
going in your room

85
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,760
after I finish my food.

86
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,390
I followed him.

87
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,270
I’m from the Hall of Flames.

88
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,090
Leave me alone.

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,180
You’re the one I’m searching for.

90
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,640
Sorry.

91
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,230
I didn’t see his face.

92
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,510
Or I could draw it on paper.

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,560
It’s okay as long as you are fine.

94
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,720
Tan Yi was being suspicious

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,230
in front of our gate.

96
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,470
There must be something wrong with him.

97
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
Young Master.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,390
Nine Moves was burnt.

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,780
[Nine Moves of Lotus God]

100
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,850
We can’t stay here.

101
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,790
Let’s go.

102
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,880
Witch.

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
Still want to leave
after you kill so many people?

104
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,480
I didn’t.

105
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,940
You’re being ridiculous.

106
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,550
What?

107
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,160
You…

108
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,200
You burnt the manual?

109
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,930
Shangguan Tou.

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,440
Why are you here?

111
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,830
Then, why is Abbess Ciren here?

112
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,250
Please listen to my words.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,650
Don’t join in anything
related to the Hall of Flames.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,040
Chong Xuezhi.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,510
It is obvious you stole the Nine Moves

116
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,320
and secretly practiced it.

117
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,510
Did you get caught by Wang Yinya?

118
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,950
So, you killed them all.

119
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,880
Nonsense.

120
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,200
Don’t do wrong to me.

121
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,320
I wouldn’t do wrong to you from nowhere.

122
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,760
To practice the Nine Moves

123
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,159
requires that you have the mental status
exclusively from the Hall of Flames.

124
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,760
Apart from you,
nobody could be fast like this.

125
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,830
You have no evidence.

126
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,230
You can’t talk nonsense.

127
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,230
Witch.

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,530
You should use you blood

129
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,550
to mourn your father’s death.

130
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,159
Okay.

131
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,350
Now that everyone said

132
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,160
I had practiced it.

133
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,440
Today,

134
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,600
I’ll show you that.

135
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,040
Abbess.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Show your move.

137
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,670
I will.

138
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,810
She’s just reached the third move.

139
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,930
She’s definitely weaker than us.

140
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,400
Do it.

141
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,110
Why do you hesitate?

142
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,880
I want to see its power as well.

143
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,640
Now that you don’t move

144
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,430
and the manual was burnt,

145
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,910
why do you even compete?

146
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,320
It’s naturally for the morals in this world.

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
You don’t deserve that.

148
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,760
You…

149
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,820
Enough, everyone.

150
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,230
Listen to me.

151
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,590
The real murderer is not here.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,840
We are all in his trap.

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
If we had a fight,

154
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,150
we’ll both lose.

155
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,520
At that time,

156
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,110
someone will reap all our benefits.

157
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,410
Are we still doing this?

158
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,470
No, let’s go.

159
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
Go.

160
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,150
You…

161
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,670
You just let them go?

162
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,670
Abbess.

163
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,110
Why didn’t you do it?

164
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,960
Why didn’t you do it?

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,030
Your Highness.

166
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,400
Your Highness.

167
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,910
Isn’t that Lord Lu?

168
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
That witch

169
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,640
has attached to Lord Lu.

170
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,350
You even didn’t know that?

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,460
Lord Lu is Shangguan Tou’s brother-in-law.

172
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,670
Your Highness. Your Highness.

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,470
You don’t need to do that.

174
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,710
Actually, I came here

175
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,320
to ask you a favor.

176
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,080
Recently,

177
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,640
there have been days of heavy rain.

178
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,880
Lots of houses were collapsed.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,140
People are suffering.

180
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,910
They become homeless and very poor.

181
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,350
What’s worse,

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,960
there’s a dam in Xiangzhou.

183
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
The dam could be breached in any minute.

184
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,280
We have to take actions to prevent it.

185
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,470
It’s very emergent.

186
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,960
We don’t have any time to ask for
assistance from the emperor.

187
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,350
So, you want to depend on yourself.

188
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,440
We need human resources now.

189
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,670
I don’t know if you two

190
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,440
are willing to help me

191
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,940
and save our people in Xiangzhou.

192
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,110
Surely,

193
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,910
I know you have

194
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,710
something emergent to deal with

195
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,550
with the leader of Hall of Flames.

196
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,280
If it’s not convenient for you,

197
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,590
I won’t force you.

198
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,150
But my physical health is actually too weak

199
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,280
to do this alone.

200
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,230
But having seen people suffer,

201
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,590
I had to ask you to help me.

202
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,470
Now that you have asked us,

203
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,000
we’ll definitely help you.

204
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,110
It’s lucky that

205
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,670
people in Xiangzhou

206
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,880
have you.

207
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,650
I invited Mr. Shangguan to come with me

208
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,590
to Xiangzhou

209
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,440
because it’s important for our Hall.

210
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,640
But comparing to the disaster

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,400
and pain people are going through,

212
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,440
this is nothing.

213
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,470
Mr. Shangguan.

214
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
You don’t need to feel sorry.

215
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,760
I am being

216
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,110
very sincere

217
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,440
and willing to leave the manual behind.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Let’s focus on people now.

219
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,280
And let’s help Lord Lu to

220
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,680
overcome this hardship.

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,000
I guess the manual you mentioned

222
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,630
is extremely important.

223
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,030
But you will become a hero

224
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,150
if you can help console our people

225
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,670
and help them survive

226
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,470
this huge disaster.

227
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,880
After this disaster,

228
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,280
if you need anything

229
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,080
from me,

230
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,880
I’ll definitely

231
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,470
pay you back.

232
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,840
You are being very generous.

233
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,100
The manual belongs to the martial world.

234
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,550
I’ll come up with a plan.

235
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,910
But I will receive

236
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,960
your kindness.

237
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,450
Your Highness.

238
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,230
Where shall we begin?

239
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,110
Please follow me.

240
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,350
Haitang.

241
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,350
Send Gugu back.

242
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,350
And send a letter back to
inform him of the burnt manual.

243
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,030
Okay.

244
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,760
So,

245
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,000
it’s impossible to kill Chong Xuezhi in Xiangzhou now.

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,080
I’m afraid yes.

247
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,910
Why?

248
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,970
Are you afraid?

249
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:28,960
Zheng.

250
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,830
Come here.

251
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,790
Look at that.

252
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,960
The house

253
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,150
is less solid than before.

254
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,550
Watch out.

255
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,050
I want to see if there’s any room for mending.

256
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
Help.

257
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,840
Help.

258
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,590
Help.

259
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,400
Your Highness.

260
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,230
Go help.

261
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Are you okay? Your Highness.

262
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Miss Chong.

263
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,350
Are you okay?

264
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,400
I’m fine.

265
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,960
Miss Chong

266
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,610
Thank you for your help.

267
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,520
It’s what I should do.

268
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,900
[KingLord Lu’s Mansion]

269
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,880
I should thank you for this.

270
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,930
Your Highness. It’s my job.

271
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,840
Then, I’ll excuse myself.

272
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,590
Miss Chong.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
We should thank you.

274
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,170
Though this is not something luxurious,

275
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,640
it’s rare.

276
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,000
I had planned to send this

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,960
to the girl Tou likes in the future.

278
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
But I really

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,590
like you.

280
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,880
Although I don’t know if Tou

281
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,520
can marry you in the future,

282
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,520
it’s a present from us.

283
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,280
Take it, please.

284
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,150
It’s too expensive.

285
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,230
If you think this is too much,

286
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,320
take one or two.

287
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,850
I really can’t take it.

288
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,960
You’re injured.

289
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,170
Let me check.

290
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,580
Why didn’t you tell me?

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
I’m fine.

292
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,550
Let’s get some medicine.

293
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,400
Let’s go.

294
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,470
Let me have a look.

295
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,230
Okay.

296
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,350
Did you make it like this on purpose?

297
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,230
It’s so ugly.

298
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,590
So what?

299
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Do you know it’s dangerous?

300
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,760
You didn’t tell anyone.

301
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
If it’s minor, it’s fine.

302
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,770
But if you get infected,

303
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
your arm will be useless.

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,550
Don’t frighten me.

305
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,960
I’ve learned martial arts from little.

306
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,640
I’ve been used to minor

307
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,590
or serious injuries.

308
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,030
This kind of minor injure

309
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,350
is normal to me.

310
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,150
Why do you make such a fuss?

311
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,400
If anyone hears this,

312
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,280
he would think

313
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,400
I’m a vulnerable girl

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,470
who can’t bear any difficulties.

315
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,790
How can I keep living in this world?

316
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,080
How can I protect and revitalize the Hall?

317
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,150
If they know about this,

318
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,680
everyone can bully me then.

319
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,880
In order to revitalize the Hall,

320
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,840
and not to be looked down upon,

321
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
you will endure it alone no matter how hard it is?

322
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,280
Yes?

323
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,150
Is this what you want?

324
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,350
Don’t you think you’re aggrieved

325
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,640
not for one second?

326
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,590
Don’t you think you can’t do it anymore

327
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,000
for one second?

328
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,400
Don’t you feel sorry for yourself?

329
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,470
Even if you don’t,

330
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,110
do you know someone does?

331
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,910
What’s wrong with you?

332
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,910
It’s just a minor injury.

333
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
You don’t have to be so exaggerated.

334
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,880
I was planning to endure it

335
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,550
till I got back.

336
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,350
They will wrap up my wound.

337
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,810
They won’t leave me alone.

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,760
And

339
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,550
I showed you a sign.

340
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,840
You didn’t see it.

341
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,320
When did you give me a sign?

342
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,350
Just now.

343
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,880
I haven’t seen that.

344
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,790
Since you knew

345
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,350
you used a signal to show that
you can’t hold it anymore.

346
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,350
If you are tough, then don’t show it.

347
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,590
You…

348
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:05,640
Let’s go.

349
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,160
What about the jewelry?

350
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
What do you think?

351
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,349
Your sister said

352
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,839
we should take them.

353
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,980
It’s not proper if we leave them here.

354
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,109
But she said

355
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,710
I can take one.

356
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,950
I got it.

357
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
I’ll take this.

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,330
Since your hand is hurt,

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,060
you shouldn’t take anything.

360
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,500
[The manual was burnt
and no more Lotus Wind in this world]

361
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,160
Come in.

362
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,350
Grandpa.

363
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,470
The 100,000 arrows Commandant needs

364
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,430
have been made.

365
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,430
Good.

366
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,280
Muyuan.

367
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,920
You will send these goods

368
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,310
to the Commandant tomorrow.

369
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,070
It concerns our reputation

370
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,410
and we shouldn’t have any accidents.

371
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,040
Yes.

372
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,830
Grandpa.

373
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,660
How’s your condition?

374
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,280
I’m much better.

375
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Don’t be worried.

376
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,880
You have a long journey tomorrow.

377
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,800
Go have a rest.

378
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,400
Well…

379
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,640
You too.

380
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,590
Mom, I’m hungry.

381
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,400
We will have food soon.

382
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,040
Thank you.

383
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,710
Thank you.

384
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,710
I didn’t expect that

385
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,040
you would do

386
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,640
something like this.

387
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,040
I didn’t expect you would, too.

388
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,680
Here.

389
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,640
Thank you.

390
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,040
Why do you sigh?

391
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,710
It occurred to me that

392
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,160
I have to confront

393
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,920
those disputes

394
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,950
after this.

395
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,590
All the schools and sects

396
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,230
leave me alone

397
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,680
because of Lord Lu.

398
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,190
But

399
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,050
I will eventually have to face it.

400
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,770
I’ll accompany you.

401
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,560
Thank you.

402
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,520
I’m so lucky to be saved by Lord Lu
and Miss Chong.

403
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Or, I would be dead now.

404
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,430
Thank you, Miss.

405
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
It’s what I should do.

406
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,040
Thank you.

407
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,640
Here.

408
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,800
Thank you.

409
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,350
Watch out.

410
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,310
Take this.

411
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,350
You should drink the medicine.

412
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,800
It’s for preventing epidemics.

413
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,070
I see. Thank you.

414
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,680
Here.

415
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,160
Thank you.

416
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,560
Here.

417
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,110
Thank you.

418
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,950
My sister is here.

419
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,640
Your Highness.

420
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,110
Your Highness.

421
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,160
Your Highness. Your Highness.

422
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
These people

423
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,640
were temporarily fed and given a place to live.

424
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,160
The dead were buried.

425
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
The injured ones

426
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,710
were sent to the hospital nearby.

427
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,710
Fortunately, there is no epidemic.

428
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,800
But we still have to rely on you

429
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
to lead them

430
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,830
to rebuild their houses.

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,760
Good.

432
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
Thank you for your help.

433
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,880
You have done a big favor for me.

434
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,120
You’ve also done a big favor

435
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,680
for people in Xiangzhou.

436
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,560
I’m flattered, Your Highness.

437
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,760
Is it still painful?

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,070
Shangguan,

439
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,230
are you worried about me?

440
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,160
I worry about so many people.

441
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,950
Mr. Shangguan,

442
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,590
you really deserve the reputation of a playboy.

443
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,710
I don’t know how many girls’ wounds

444
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,160
were wrapped up by you.

445
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,350
You should have such nice skill.

446
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,230
I don’t know how many girls

447
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,040
are left with your affection

448
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
that they can’t forget you.

449
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,880
While you

450
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,520
can just turn your back

451
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,040
and float away like wind.

452
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,160
It will have no impact on you.

453
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,040
I don’t know who prepared the medicine.

454
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,770
Is it medicine or just vinegar?

455
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,640
I smell something sour.

456
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,250
You really don’t know about me.

457
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,110
I would be

458
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,590
very happy

459
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,640
to

460
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,290
help others.

461
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,350
No.

462
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,880
What??

463
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,230
Are you okay?

464
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,890
Does it hurt?

465
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,070
Stop now.

466
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,800
Your arrow is very sharp.

467
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,680
Good skill.

468
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,190
Sir.

469
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,470
This is armor-piercing arrow
made by the Hall of Flames.

470
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,800
The head is heavy and the rear feather is long.

471
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,920
If you shoot it high,

472
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,310
it can pierce the armor.

473
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,190
So,

474
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,230
I brought fire arrows to you.

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,330
It’s hollow in the head.

476
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,280
It can set a fire and kill an enemy.

477
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,680
It’s exclusively made by

478
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,470
the Hall of Flames.

479
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,090
The Hall of Flames has such advanced skills that

480
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,830
the grain is so delicate.

481
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,230
Commandant will be

482
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,920
so satisfied.

483
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,560
guards

484
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,350
This is

485
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,520
sent to you

486
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,980
by the Commandant.

487
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,070
Thank you.

488
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,920
Mr. Leader,

489
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,950
the carriage is ready.

490
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,950
We are ready to go.

491
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,310
What did you call me?

492
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,710
Mr. Leader...

493
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,440
Who told you to call me like that?

494
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,280
No...nobody.

495
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,070
You’re breaking the rule
for not revealing the truth.

496
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,070
Do you know that?

497
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,680
All of us know that

498
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,760
you’ll be the leader.

499
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,110
Stop calling me that.

500
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,520
Chief Guardian.

501
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,800
Everyone knows that

502
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,260
Lotus Wind was set up by Chong’s and Yuwen’s.

503
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,760
It’s the basis of the position of

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,800
the Hall of Flames in the world.

505
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,590
You had half of the contribution.

506
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,710
But now,

507
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,410
no one can take this burden.

508
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,590
We all think

509
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,920
Yuwen should inherit this legacy.

510
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,180
Yeah, Chief Guardian.

511
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,710
I didn’t hear

512
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,690
what you said today.

513
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,640
If I heard anything

514
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,920
like this in the future,

515
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,350
you two would

516
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,370
have to leave the Hall.

517
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

518
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,350
Every cloud

519
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,080
has a silver lining.

520
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,440
We can finally see the moon now.

521
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,110
Yeah.

522
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,040
It’s a pity that

523
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
the Nine Moves of Lotus God

524
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,070
was burnt into ashes.

525
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,640
You must feel upset.

526
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,560
Xuezhi,

527
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,760
I told you that

528
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,570
learning martial arts

529
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,950
is to protect what we love.

530
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,740
Did you see this bracelet?

531
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,590
I promise you that

532
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,510
whenever you see this bracelet,

533
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,680
and no matter where I am,

534
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,330
I will always be by your side

535
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,110
and protect you.

536
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,710
I promise you that

537
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,430
no matter where you are,

538
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,560
I’ll protect the Hall for you forever.

539
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,160
Actually,

540
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,110
when I was little,

541
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,050
my father told me to remember the Lotus Wind.

542
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,130
This is what my father left me.

543
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,670
I’ll never forget it.

544
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,470
So, you lost nothing.

545
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,400
Instead,

546
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,660
those people who want it will give up now.

547
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,190
It’s a good thing.

548
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,800
So what?

549
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,050
They can’t get the manual.

550
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,410
They will make us difficult as usual.

551
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,760
At first,

552
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,830
I wanted to prove that my father

553
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,640
and the Hall is innocent.

554
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,110
Unexpectedly,

555
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,230
I am wronged

556
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,560
just like my father.

557
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Miss Chong.

558
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,160
You cannot change others’ opinions

559
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,590
in one day.

560
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,070
Actually,

561
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,070
I envy you sometimes.

562
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,000
You can choose to escape from that.

563
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,920
After the death of my father,

564
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,800
I became the leader of the Hall of Flames.

565
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,430
Before I met you,

566
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,470
I don’t know

567
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,350
we have a way

568
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
called escaping.

569
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,070
You are not me.

570
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,270
You don’t know my difficulties.

571
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,160
Escaping is not a way.

572
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,070
It cannot fix any problem.

573
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,070
So,

574
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,600
what are you escaping from?

575
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,590
I don’t know either.

576
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,520
But I will soon.

577
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,760
It’s perhaps a good thing.

578
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Good things never happen in the end.

579
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,920
But now,

580
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,110
I want to face it.

581
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,350
Then, go ahead.

582
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,760
Anyway,

583
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,880
your mission of protecting

584
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,400
has been accomplished.

585
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,960
Why did you say that?

586
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,470
Actually, I’m thinking about

587
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,430
returning to the Hall tomorrow.

588
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,110
I have to tell them

589
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,430
what happened.

590
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,880
So I should still protect you

591
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,110
on the way back.

592
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,190
Don’t be worried.

593
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,350
I have four guardians

594
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,800
on the way back.

595
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,160
After I return,

596
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,090
Muyuan will protect me.

597
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,430
Again,

598
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,840
you can protect me temporarily.

599
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,470
But you can’t do that for a lifetime.

600
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,290
If we continue that,

601
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,950
there’ll be no end at all.

602
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,530
I don’t expect that

603
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,490
you’ll be stuck on me forever.

604
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,160
Tou.

605
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,140
[To Tou,
If you want to know your identity,
come to Emei as soon as possible.
Abbess Baiyun]

606
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,000
If you want to know your identity,
come to Emei as soon as possible.

607
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,190
Abbess Baiyun.

608
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,000
Have them prepare for

609
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,070
the journey to Emei.

610
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes.

611
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,400
Young Master.

612
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
Mr. Shangguan left you a letter.

613
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,620
They’ve set off to Emei Mountain.

614
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,000
Miss Chong.

615
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,710
Don’t forget that

616
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,210
you still owe me something.

617
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,470
So, is it a yes?

618
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,380
But I have to ask something

619
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,710
from you

620
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,110
after it’s done.

621
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,190
Name what you want.

622
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,880
After it’s done,

623
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,240
I want something

624
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,230
that’s most important to you.

625
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,760
No problem. I promised.

626
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,520
Good.

627
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Then it’s a deal.

628
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,110
A deal.

629
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,830
There is no such thing
as a never-ending feast.

630
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,800
Miss Chong.

631
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,440
Let’s say farewell.

632
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,640
Take care.

633
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,230
You can protect me temporarily.

634
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,430
But you can’t do that forever.

635
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,690
If we continue that,

636
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
there’ll be no end at all.

637
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,890
I don’t expect that

638
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,770
you’ll be stuck on me forever.

639
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,380
Mr. Shangguan.

640
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Let’s go

641
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,190
to Emei.

642
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,180
[KingLord Xin’s Mansion]

643
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,210
Your Highness.

644
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,160
A message from Xiangzhou.

645
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,280
The flood crisis there

646
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,480
has been alleviated.

647
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,000
Those people in difficulties

648
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,260
were properly placed in accommodation.

649
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,760
He resolved the crisis

650
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,070
all by himself.

651
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,160
I didn’t

652
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,070
expect that.

653
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,040
But…

654
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
His physical condition is poor.

655
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,310
He must have suffered a lot.

656
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,190
I heard

657
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,950
some rumors

658
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,470
about the flood crisis there.

659
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,230
Go ahead.

660
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,590
Lord Lu has

661
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
asked for a lot of people in the martial world

662
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,070
to resolve this crisis.

663
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,640
He has gained

664
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,800
huge popularity from the public.

665
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,160
Ridiculous.

666
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,640
Please calm down.

667
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,880
Xiangzhou is distant

668
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,190
with few people.

669
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,110
He must have met

670
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,770
many difficulties this time.

671
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,560
There is no way out

672
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,350
but resorting to people in the martial world.

673
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,350
It’s reasonable.

674
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,680
Also,

675
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,090
he loves freedom when little.

676
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,530
He envied his uncles’ life

677
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,310
in that world.

678
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,590
His heart has never

679
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,950
stayed in this palace.

680
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,070
After all,

681
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,350
he is still a child.

682
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,190
But we have always been

683
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,880
concerned about his health.

684
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,680
He’s also worried about that.

685
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,950
He thinks father did not care about him.

686
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,080
So, we gradually get

687
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,110
drifted away.

688
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
But how on earth could he

689
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,190
know our father’s effort.

690
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,560
It’s so delicious.

691
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,950
Yeah.

692
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,560
Have some.

693
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,470
You too.

694
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,110
I’m fine.

695
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,350
Why didn’t he say farewell to me in person?

696
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,400
Young Master.

697
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,430
What’re you thinking?

698
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,880
Here you are.

699
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,080
I think it's weird that

700
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,520
I began to connect all the things

701
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
happening during our journey.

702
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,389
You don’t want that?

703
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,469
It seems like someone

704
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,710
is familiar with

705
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,760
each of our move.

706
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,469
Yes.

707
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,000
I think

708
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,120
there’s only one possibility.

709
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,670
There’s someone

710
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,000
disloyal to our Hall.

711
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
I really don’t how

712
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,400
I should tell this to elders.

713
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
If they knew it,

714
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,889
they would be outraged.

715
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,870
Young Master.

716
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,960
If you find out this person,

717
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,850
how would you deal with him?

718
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,429
I want to ask him

719
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,190
why he turns back on us?

720
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,320
Haitang?

721
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,560
What’s wrong?

722
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,280
What’s wrong?

723
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,870
We have run out of the water.

724
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,400
I’ll go collect some water.

725
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,950
If we take the sideway in the west,

726
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,560
it will be a little dangerous.

727
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,360
The road in the south is a detour.

728
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,800
So, which way is faster?

729
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,710
The sideway in the west.

730
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,190
Okay, let’s go west.

731
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,080
You want to be faster?

732
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,360
Actually, I know a faster path.

733
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,600
Which way?

734
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,840
There is an alley forward in the mountains.

735
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,760
It’ll save hours for us.

736
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,870
I’ve been there.

737
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,120
I don’t remember there’s a way forward.

738
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,320
Perhaps you didn’t go deeper,

739
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,380
so you don’t see it.

740
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,120
Young Master.

741
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,890
The road ahead is a bit rugged.

742
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,780
But to us, it’s not difficult.

743
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,870
Then, let’s do it.

744
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,800
We will take the one on the mountain.

745
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,860
So, we can return as soon as possible.

746
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
Let’s get ready.

747
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,320
Okay.

748
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,870
Did you arrange that?

749
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,360
What?

750
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,600
You arranged some disciples

751
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,280
to call me Leader.

752
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,670
What?

753
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,190
Really?

754
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,120
It’s ridiculous.

755
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,800
It’s not you.

756
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,080
How would I do this?

757
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,720
Go find the disciples

758
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,920
and I will punish them severely.

759
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,000
It’s fine.

760
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,270
I have already done that.

761
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,640
Now that you haven’t done this,

762
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,130
I’ll excuse myself.

763
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,000
Muyuan.

764
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,910
Did you ask why?

765
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,910
They said

766
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,630
the position of the Hall of Flames

767
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,920
depends on Yuwen’s assistance.

768
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,130
Today, Chong family cannot

769
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,950
shoulder this burden now.

770
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,600
So…

771
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,200
though they call Chong Xuezhi as Young Master,

772
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,360
they think you are the right one.

773
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,760
In their opinions,

774
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,320
you’re the leader of the Hall.

775
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,120
Grandpa.

776
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,840
I think

777
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,360
we shouldn’t

778
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,970
separate the Hall into two families.

779
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
After my father died,

780
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,630
Mr. Chong adopted me,

781
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,760
he raised me and taught me.

782
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,280
In my heart,

783
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,450
I’ve already regard them as my family.

784
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,760
And my job is to

785
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,950
assist my own family

786
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,230
and pay back to him.

787
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,520
Yeah.

788
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,560
You’re not the only one that thinks like that.

789
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,040
Everybody does.

790
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,150
It’s because we’re a family.

791
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,430
So,

792
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
the leader of the Hall of Flames

793
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,910
can be a Yuwen

794
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,870
or a Chong.

795
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,200
There’s no difference.

796
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,730
Of course, there is.

797
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,040
Since Mr. Chong chose to

798
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,320
give this seat to the Young Master,

799
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,320
it means he hoped that

800
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Young Master

801
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,190
could lead.

802
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,080
If I call myself

803
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,470
Leader today,

804
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,040
how can I face

805
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,840
Mr. Chong in the heaven?

806
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,760
Muyuan.

807
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,720
Have you ever thought about

808
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
why Chong Ye

809
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,670
adopted you as his son?

810
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,670
It means that

811
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,120
you can take his seat.

812
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,950
If that’s the case,

813
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,120
then, you’re failing

814
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,950
his effort.

815
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,360
Grandpa.

816
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,250
I don’t want to talk about that.

817
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,690
I’ll excuse myself.

818
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,670
Muyuan.

819
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,760
I’ll help you

820
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,390
to be the leader.

821
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,700
[Yuwen Yupan]

822
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,690
Someone’s here.

823
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,630
Protect the Young Master!

824
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,600
Liuli.

825
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,710
Hurry up, take Gugu away.

826
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,910
What about you?

827
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,640
I’ll follow.

828
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,040
Gugu, let’s go.

829
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,120
Haitang, help us.

830
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,910
Okay,

831
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,520
They’re here for Young Master.

832
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,580
You know the route, take her with you.

833
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,470
Young Master, let’s go.

834
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,120
Go.

835
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,800
Go for her.

836
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,660
Water Sword Knack.

837
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
You’re from the Hall.

838
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,870
Young Master.

839
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:28,950
Haitang.

840
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,760
Hold onto me.

841
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,910
Young Master.

842
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,710
Young Master.
