And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 36

4
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,690
You are from Xiangzhou?

5
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,960
You’re smart.

6
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,750
I'm a guest of Lord Lu.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,829
What was your

8
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,440
Lord Lu thinking?

9
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Does he think every time he sent

10
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
different men, gave different talks,

11
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
and the results would

12
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,390
be different as well?

13
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,560
The hatred of destroyed my sect

14
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,290
will not be eliminated

15
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,630
even if I cut his flesh and bones.

16
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,600
Go back and tell Lord Lu,

17
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,000
I’ll

18
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,550
let him

19
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,190
pay for this

20
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,240
one day.

21
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,830
His Highness

22
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,170
can destroy the Hall of Flames,

23
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,440
so can

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,130
rebuild the Hall of Flames.

25
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,160
If His Highness

26
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,630
gives you

27
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,520
a Hall of Flames without a stain,

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,550
then do you still have the hatred of

29
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,750
destroyed your sect?

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,270
I'll give you back

31
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,010
the same Hall of Flames in three years.

32
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,880
Whether the Hall of Flames be

33
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,200
destroyed for a time or forever

34
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,360
is entirely

35
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,910
up to you.

36
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,550
If you want it,

37
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,800
His Highness

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,750
will see to it that you

39
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,030
become the new leader of the Hall of Flames.

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,960
No need.

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
The Hall of Flames

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,960
has a leader.

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,440
Don’t bother.

44
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you done?

45
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
Please leave.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,720
Alright.

47
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,360
But you can

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
never know

49
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,080
what will happen.

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,070
Former leader was so invincible,

51
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,550
yet he met his own destiny, right?

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,200
A sharp sword

53
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,600
will wound itself.

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,550
Love hurts people

55
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,320
effortlessly.

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
Love

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,830
can let the living to die,

58
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,320
but can it

59
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,310
also bring the dead back to life?

60
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,390
It was wise

61
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,920
that you didn’t go with Leader Chong

62
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,270
and Master Shangguan

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
to break into the execution ground.

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,200
Execution ground?

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,550
After all, this was way too dangerous.

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,070
Once arrested,

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,350
I don't think

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,080
there'll be another Imperial Advisor

69
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,070
help them

70
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,480
and give them a way out again.

71
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,600
How are they doing?

72
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,960
Thanks to the kindness of Her Highness,

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
they escaped.

74
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,320
They say

75
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,540
love and water are enough for lovers.

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,070
I saw how much

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,950
they love each other.

78
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,720
Now they escaped,

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,790
it should be a good thing.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
After all,

81
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,920
exile together

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,200
is like

83
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,070
a trip for a couple.

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,350
Are you done?

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,510
Please leave.

86
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,440
So you really

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,320
want to retire.

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,050
Well, it's for the best.

89
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,070
There is no old love in the heart,

90
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,600
so when the old love is going to die,

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,230
you will not be sad.

92
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,270
What do you mean?

93
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,410
His Highness cherishes talents.

94
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,950
He is willing to work with you.

95
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,600
I said, what do you mean?

96
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,790
You!

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,830
Xuezhi.

98
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,830
Hongxiu.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
You're awake.

100
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,600
Where's Tou?

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,440
He left

102
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,790
early in the morning.

103
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,640
I don't know what the rush is.

104
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,200
Xuezhi.

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,390
I have

106
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,760
something to ask you.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
You're not well enough

108
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,390
to travel.

109
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,920
Why did you come all the way

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,950
from Moon Valley?

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I know

112
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,950
my days are numbered.

113
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,830
I don’t want to stay in

114
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,270
the only place he can live.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,640
I’m afraid once I leave,

116
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,270
he can never let go.

117
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,840
Drowning himself in pain

118
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,000
every day and night.

119
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,040
So,

120
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,000
I found an excuse

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,230
to let him take me out.

122
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,440
Hongxiu.

123
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,350
Don't worry.

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,040
I’ll leave in peace and quiet.

125
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,920
Like a leaf

126
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,790
turning to dust,

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,460
with nothing left behind.

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Xuezhi.

129
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,200
I understand

130
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,640
how you feel.

131
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,830
But no matter when

132
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,790
or where,

133
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,760
Tou will

134
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,000
miss you

135
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,830
no less.

136
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,920
I know.

137
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,480
If one of

138
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,830
two loved ones

139
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,350
has to leave first,

140
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,880
then the saddest

141
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,200
and most painful one

142
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,950
is not the one that leaves

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,600
but the one that stays.

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,200
At this point,

145
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,549
I have no other choice

146
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,760
but to hope that

147
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
Tou

148
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,520
can find someone to replace me.

149
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,960
There are

150
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,320
a lot of great girls in this world,

151
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,840
and he doesn't have to be alone for me.

152
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,520
Hongxiu.

153
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,320
You and Zhong Tao

154
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,350
are Tou’s best friends.

155
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,760
And you understand him the most.

156
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,320
So I’m begging you.

157
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,350
Help me persuade Tou.

158
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
When I'm gone,

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,110
tell him not to feel too bad.

160
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,230
If you can,

161
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,200
find him a nice girl

162
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,680
and forget about me.

163
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,670
Silly girl.

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
It's his own problem.

165
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,010
You need to stop worrying.

166
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,760
I thought it was a big deal.

167
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,000
Turns out,

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you’re picking flowers for Xuezhi.

169
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,470
Tou.

170
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,590
These are beautiful.

171
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,850
I'm glad you like them.

172
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
How are you

173
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,590
feeling today?

174
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,150
Winehouse of Fairyland is really a good place.

175
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,880
I feel

176
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,840
much better here.

177
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,680
I'm right here with you.

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,110
Why would you do this?

181
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,520
Servant!

182
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,590
Fang Yue!

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,940
Your Highness…

184
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,110
Tell me.

185
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,000
Was she

186
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,910
pregnant with my child?

187
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,320
Answer me!

188
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

189
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,450
Her Highness was nearly three months pregnant.

190
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,910
Why didn't you tell me?

191
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,640
Why didn't you tell me?

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,880
Her Highness told me not to tell you.

193
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,520
How can a servant live

194
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,520
if she cannot take care

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,110
of her own master?

196
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,440
I will pay with Shangguan Tou's life

197
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,640
for the life of our child!

198
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,910
Where is Xuezhi?

199
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,280
She’s resting.

200
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,960
Lately,

201
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,010
she's been getting worse.

202
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,750
Hongxiu, what are you doing?

203
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,100
Get rid of the useless things.

204
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,890
How do you distinguish useful

205
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,960
from useless?

206
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,440
So much information needs to be kept up to date.

207
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,590
If in ten years,

208
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,350
no one had made any inquiries,

209
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,410
these information would be useless.

210
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,790
How do you know that information of

211
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,050
ten years ago won’t be brought by anyone?

212
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,670
Maybe someone would buy

213
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,290
these old information.

214
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,150
But the chances are slim.

215
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,200
I’m an information dealer.

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,170
But I can’t save so much of them.

217
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,910
You are indeed a business woman.

218
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,350
A business woman needs to do the math.

219
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,710
Swallow Sect?

220
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,770
What's going on?

221
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,470
Hongxiu.

222
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,550
Can you get me everything you have

223
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,480
on Swallow Sect?

224
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,230
Of course.

225
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,030
Miss.

226
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,910
This is from last month.

227
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,280
-Fengzi.
-Master.

228
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,150
Leave us.

229
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,910
Yes.

230
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,820
What are you doing?

231
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,360
I'm looking at this month's accounts.

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,030
I want to help my father

233
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,760
with the business in the Manor.

234
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
You've really grown up.

235
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm better now.

236
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,230
Thank you for taking good care of me.

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,790
As long as you're safe

238
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,910
and happy,

239
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,350
I'll be happy.

240
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,550
Fengzi.

241
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,890
I've come here today

242
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,670
to say goodbye to you.

243
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,230
Goodbye?

244
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,400
Are you leaving?

245
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,670
Why?

246
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Back then,

247
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,470
I was under Feng Cheng’s spell,

248
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,230
so I did what I had to do.

249
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,060
After Feng Cheng died, I realized

250
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,320
there was

251
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,320
nothing left for me in this world.

252
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,960
So I decided

253
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,610
to dismiss Swallow Sect

254
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,630
and leave Central Plain.

255
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,000
Master.

256
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,790
Are you leaving me now?

257
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,200
I hate to leave you, too.

258
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,520
But I do know

259
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,730
that my Fengzi is old enough

260
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,980
to take care of your father

261
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,840
and be your own woman.

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,020
Then you must remember

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,110
to visit me often.

264
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,400
Of course.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
I'll come visit you

266
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,480
every year on your birthday.

267
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,550
Xuezhi may be saved.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,930
What did you say?

269
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,710
Xuezhi…

270
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,880
Swallow Sect

271
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,550
may have a cure for Wuse Skill injuries.

272
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,080
Hongxiu, look.

273
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
It says here that

274
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,230
the founder of Swallow Sect was

275
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,590
from Moyan Sect in foreign land.

276
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,110
But his mother was a Central Plain woman.

277
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,200
That's why he's obsessed

278
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,440
with his own blood.

279
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,150
He stole one Tianling Stone from the sect

280
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,710
and brought it to Central Plain,

281
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,320
then he founded Swallow Sect.

282
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,710
His martial art skills were unique.

283
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,230
And his routines were quite different.

284
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,280
So,

285
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,470
he quickly made a name for himself.

286
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,200
But what does that have to do

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,470
with Xuezhi's injuries?

288
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,760
The founder of Swallow Sect’s from foreign land.

289
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,150
So were Warriors in Black

290
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,280
that wounded Xuezhi.

291
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,640
And their skills

292
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,550
came from the Moyan Sect.

293
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,030
So,

294
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,360
I think there's a good chance

295
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,240
the Warriors in Black were from the Moyan Sect.

296
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,910
Even if we now know

297
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,640
where the Wuse Skill came from,

298
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,840
how can we treat it?

299
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,150
I just said that

300
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,230
the founder of Swallow Sect

301
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,670
stolen a Tianling stone.

302
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
This Tianling Stone

303
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,330
is the sacred relic of Moyan Sect.

304
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,000
Brought to the Central Plain,

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,520
the Stone was protected by leaders.

306
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,470
You mean…

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,210
Yuan Shuangshuang.

308
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,680
By the way,

309
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,000
I have something

310
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,280
for you.

311
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,000
This is…

312
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,840
Tianling Stone?

313
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,030
I've decided to

314
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,540
dismiss Swallow Sect,

315
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,520
so you'll be in charge

316
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,440
of the Stone.

317
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,230
I'm sure

318
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,880
you'll take good care of it.

319
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
I will, master.

320
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,000
You see,

321
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,840
it also says that

322
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,760
the martial arts of the Moyan Sect

323
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,620
are in line with the Qi of Tianling.

324
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,150
And members of the sect used

325
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,110
Tianling Stones to heal their wounds.

326
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,040
Unfortunately,

327
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,150
Tianling Stones are extremely rare.

328
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,400
After a hundred of years,

329
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,660
there is not much left.

330
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,910
If Tianling Stone can truly heal

331
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,710
injuries made by Wuse Skill,

332
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,880
you should leave for Sword Manor immediately.

333
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,350
Word is Yuan Shuangshuang's still there.

334
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,150
That’s right.

335
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,880
If you're embarrassed, I can go in your place.

336
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,590
No.

337
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,710
I'm going.

338
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,000
Have you met Yuwen Muyuan?

339
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,640
How'd it go?

340
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,920
The way I see it,

341
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,349
Yuwen Muyuan

342
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
is not a power-hungry man.

343
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,369
The leader of the Hall of Flames

344
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,680
is less important to him than

345
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,520
Chong Xuezhi.

346
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
So I told him Chong Xuezhi’s dying,

347
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,560
the rest

348
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,230
is up to him.

349
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,350
So you're saying that

350
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,280
Yuwen Muyuan may

351
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,230
turn to me for Chong Xuezhi?

352
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,490
I’m taking my chances.

353
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,830
If he does show up,

354
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,110
it'll prove

355
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,680
we found Yuwen Muyuan's weak spot.

356
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,470
Chong Xuezhi is your leverage over Yuwen Muyuan.

357
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,680
Good.

358
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,880
Let's see

359
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,880
if you can win this one.

360
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,930
Xuezhi.

361
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,800
I finally found a way to save you.

362
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,450
You wait for me.

363
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,880
Wait for me.

364
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,560
Can you persuade Yuan Shuangshuang

365
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,090
to lend you Tianling Stone?

366
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,880
Have you thought about what will happen

367
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,480
if she doesn't lend it to you?

368
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,490
I didn't think about it,

369
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,640
because I’ll bring it back.

370
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,280
Hongxiu.

371
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,430
While I'm gone,

372
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,410
can you do me a favor?

373
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,340
I promised Xuezhi I'd pick

374
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,350
a flower every day and put it on her pillow.

375
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,030
I don't want to go back on my word.

376
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,160
Can you

377
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,710
help me with that?

378
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,490
Don't worry.

379
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,960
I'll take care of it.

380
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Thanks, Hongxiu.

381
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,640
The peonies are elegant,

382
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,800
but something is missing here.

383
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,830
What are you doing here?

384
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,490
Have a seat.

385
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,590
I’m just on my way out

386
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,720
to run some errands,

387
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,160
so I want to ask you if you need anything,

388
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,490
and I'll bring it to you.

389
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,760
Nothing for use.

390
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,470
Why don't you bring me back some food?

391
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,000
Sure.

392
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,160
The

393
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
preserved fruits from west street?

394
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,140
How do you know?

395
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,710
I have foresight.

396
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,350
Oh, right.

397
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,400
You said

398
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,040
there is something missing.

399
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,830
Look,

400
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,470
peonies are so beautiful.

401
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,470
But don’t you think only peonies here

402
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,040
may be too simple?

403
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,880
But,

404
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,990
the peony is the king of flowers,

405
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,310
if I embroider other flowers,

406
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,840
it won’t look noble.

407
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
The king of flowers is the peony.

408
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,920
But

409
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,970
the flowers are so beautiful,

410
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,040
how can there be no bees,

411
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,160
or butterflies?

412
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,680
Right!

413
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,840
I could embroider a butterfly.

414
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,070
That's much better.

415
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,760
Fine.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll start right now.

417
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,590
By the time you get back,

418
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,590
I'll probably have it all embroidered.

419
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,680
I’m going to run errands.

420
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,020
I'll bring you preserved fruits.

421
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,370
Shall I embroider here

422
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,710
or here?

423
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:07,950
Xuezhi.

424
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,570
Shangguan Tou.

425
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,620
He is looking for the cure.

426
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,830
I'm sure he'll be back for you

427
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,470
with the cure.

428
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,730
You just have to hang in there.

429
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,110
Wait for him to return.

430
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,130
Chief Guardian Muyuan.

431
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,190
Lord Lu is a very evil man.

432
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,710
Lin Changran failed to get the cure.

433
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,850
And Her Highness is grounded.

434
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Looks like Lord Lu

435
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,560
is determined to kill

436
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,950
Xuezhi this time.

437
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,740
His Highness cherishes talents.

438
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,940
He is willing to work with you.

439
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,830
I said, what do you mean?

440
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,710
Don't worry about it too much.

441
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,290
Tou is looking for the cure now.

442
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

443
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Miss Qiu, do you think

444
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,960
Shangguan Tou can bring back the cure?

445
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,040
I'm sure

446
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,000
he'll do everything he can.

447
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,930
You believe him.

448
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,160
But I don't.

449
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,770
I want Shangguan Tou to bring Xuezhi happiness,

450
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,590
not lead Xuezhi to death.

451
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,800
It's not Tou's fault.

452
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,520
So it's my fault?

453
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,000
Growing up,

454
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,040
I never let Xuezhi

455
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,040
get hurt in front of my eyes.

456
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,040
Shangguan Tou said he loved her,

457
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,370
and that's how he did it?

458
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,080
If I had known,

459
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,470
I would have

460
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,970
kept Xuezhi with me no matter what.

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,490
Chief Guardian Muyuan!

462
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,640
How long can Xuezhi hold out?

463
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,800
I see.

464
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,830
Please, Miss Qiu, for me…

465
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,760
Please

466
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,990
take good care of Xuezhi.

467
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Don't tell her I was here.

468
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,800
Tou.

469
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,950
You must come back with the cure.

470
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,070
Leader.

471
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,810
I can't believe

472
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,160
you agreed to meet with me.

473
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,360
If you didn't think I would see you,

474
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,850
why did you come?

475
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,640
Because I have to.

476
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,280
Fengzi told me

477
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,430
what happened.

478
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,040
I was wrong about you.

479
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,130
But what's done is done.

480
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,350
We can’t go back to before.

481
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,560
If you're here to ask amends,

482
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,560
I'll take it.

483
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,480
You're overthinking this.

484
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,020
Over the years,

485
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,800
I've gotten used to being misunderstood.

486
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,880
And I don't care

487
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,190
what the world thinks of me.

488
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,010
Since I didn't pursue it then,

489
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,520
I won't pursue it today.

490
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,490
Leader Lin.

491
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,830
Since you know what happened,

492
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,230
I’m hoping that you could help me

493
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,840
with what I'm asking for today.

494
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,110
Miss, Master Shangguan is here.

495
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,470
Do you know what he's doing here?

496
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,200
I don't know.

497
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,280
But he's talking to Leader in the hall.

498
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,340
As soon as I saw him, I came to tell you.

499
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,280
As long as you're not here for Fengzi,

500
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:12,950
I can

501
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,690
promise you anything.

502
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,590
Don't worry, Leader.

503
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,470
In fact,

504
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,280
I take Fengzi as my sister.

505
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,430
Whether it happened or not,

506
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,110
Fengzi and I

507
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,640
will never be a couple.

508
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,680
Because

509
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,350
I'm already in love.

510
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,470
It's for the best.

511
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,680
I knew Fengzi had a crush on you since little.

512
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,730
Otherwise, she wouldn't have done such a

513
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,560
shameful thing at the instigation of her master.

514
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,770
And I hope you don't blame her.

515
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,310
I may have

516
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,310
misjudged you,

517
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,760
but last time, because of you, Fengzi

518
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,160
canceled the engagement banquet

519
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,050
and got humiliated in front of people.

520
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,450
What happened between

521
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,460
Sword Manor and you

522
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,350
is even.

523
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,040
Besides,

524
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,230
Fengzi's in a better mood lately.

525
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,310
I don't want her

526
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,640
anywhere near you.

527
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
I hope you can understand

528
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,160
my feelings as a father.

529
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,300
Leader Lin.

530
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,800
Relax.

531
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,280
I’m not here

532
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,310
for Fengzi.

533
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,710
Actually,

534
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,110
I’m here for Leader Yuan.

535
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,320
What do you want with her?

536
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,550
I know that

537
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,810
Leader Yuan is here in Sword Manor.

538
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,430
I need to borrow something from her.

539
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,950
What is it?

540
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,000
Tianling Stone.

541
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,490
Tianling Stone?

542
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,900
What do you need it for?

543
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,400
Fengzi.

544
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,040
What are you doing here?

545
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,920
Tianling Stone is Swallow Sect's sacred relic.

546
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,190
If someone wants to borrow it,

547
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,400
I have to ask.

548
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,680
Fengzi.

549
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,170
I'll take care of it.

550
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,570
Go to your room.

551
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,710
Father.

552
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,880
Since Master Shangguan is here

553
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,070
to borrow Swallow Sect's sacred relic,

554
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,160
as the Chief Disciple of Swallow Sect,

555
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,880
I shall

556
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,560
take care of this matter.

557
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,710
Master no longer cares about the outside world.

558
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,040
Tianling Stone has been placed in my care.

559
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,390
If Master Shangguan wants to borrow it,

560
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,770
just come with me, please.

561
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:49,780
[Jade Hall]

562
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,710
Fengzi.

563
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,600
Are you really willing to lend it to me?

564
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,170
I know you don't have me in your heart,

565
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,310
but I still expect you

566
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,160
to come for me.

567
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,470
Fengzi.

568
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,640
What do you need it for?

569
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,760
Xuezhi was hurt by Wuse Skill.

570
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,840
She's getting worse every day.

571
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,610
Only the Tianling Stone can save her now.

572
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,320
You’re saying

573
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,230
Xuezhi was hurt by Wuse Skill?

574
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,930
You know about that?

575
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
I heard master mentioned it.

576
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,930
If you want to cure the Wuse Skill,

577
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,340
you must destroy the Tianling Stone.

578
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,470
The Tianling Stone is my sacred relic.

579
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I promised master

580
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,070
I'd keep it safe.

581
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,680
But it's the only way

582
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,160
to save her now.

583
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,110
I'm afraid...

584
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,960
I'm afraid she won't last much longer.

585
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,880
Are you going to watch her die?

586
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,590
Fengzi.

587
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,760
This time, I'm begging you.

588
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,450
I'm begging you.

589
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,310
Begging me?

590
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,520
You are

591
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,880
begging me?

592
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,710
Are you still the Brother Tou I know?

593
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,230
Does the Leader of Moon Valley

594
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
beg people

595
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,470
like this?

596
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,880
Fengzi.

597
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,450
As long as you give me the Tianling Stone,

598
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,070
I'll do anything you want.

599
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,160
Fine.

600
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,640
I need you

601
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,830
to do two things.

602
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,280
Go ahead.

603
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,830
Can you give me a hug?

604
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,470
What else?

605
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,110
Will

606
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,680
you

607
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
marry me?

608
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,600
Fengzi.

609
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,000
I never

610
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
compared you to Xuezhi.

611
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,909
You'll never be

612
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,040
the same to me.

613
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,670
But if

614
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,360
marrying you

615
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,040
will save Xuezhi,

616
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,909
then I will.

617
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,640
Since master gave me the Stone,

618
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,030
I’ve never let it out of my sight.

619
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,600
Now,

620
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,080
take it.

621
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,840
If anything happens to Xuezhi,

622
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,120
you'll be sad.

623
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,430
I don't want to see you sad.

624
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,230
I owed

625
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,430
you before.

626
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,290
Now I give you the Tianling Stone,

627
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,950
from now on,

628
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,760
we’re even.

629
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,530
Thank you, Fengzi.

630
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,670
Thank you.

631
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,520
Qingmei.

632
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
Why are you following me?

633
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,430
Master Shangguan was just here.

634
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,080
Where is he?

635
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,470
Long gone.

636
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,360
Fengzi.

637
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,560
It's done so quickly.

638
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,660
Embroidered with the butterfly,

639
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,930
the peonies bloomed

640
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,430
more brightly.

641
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,150
Qingmei.

642
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,390
Do you think

643
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,870
it's wishful thinking for me

644
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,670
to embroider

645
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
this butterfly here?

646
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Maybe it doesn't even like peonies.

647
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,600
If I were this butterfly,

648
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,910
I would feel lucky

649
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,610
to fly in the side of the peony.

650
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,150
Here.

651
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,940
Your favorite preserved fruits.

652
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,150
Shangguan Tou was here today.

653
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,910
I know.

654
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,060
The guy at the door told me.

655
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,880
You're not over him, are you?

656
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,000
I've decided

657
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,190
to let him go.

658
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,230
Actually,

659
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,630
what happened before

660
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,800
was did by my master.

661
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,690
Then why didn't he tell us?

662
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,430
Because since he came to Sword Manor,

663
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,910
I've decided he's

664
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,000
the most perfect man

665
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,520
in the world.

666
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,670
He came to me today

667
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,560
to borrow the Stone to save Xuezhi.

668
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,880
I was trying to give him a hard time.

669
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
I thought it would

670
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,630
make me happy

671
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,190
and relieved.

672
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,630
Qingmei.

673
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm such an idiot.

674
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,950
I’m so stupid.

675
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,360
I thought

676
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,630
I loved him for ten years.

677
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,280
But until today, I found that

678
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,670
my love is not him at all

679
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,230
but a childhood obsession of mine.

680
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,390
Are you disappointed in me?

681
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,560
Do you look down on me?

682
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,280
You must have no idea

683
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,150
I am a woman like this.

684
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,520
I would throw away my reputation

685
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,710
to get a man.

686
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,560
Fengzi.

687
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,450
I've never been disappointed in you.

688
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,370
And I don't look down on you.

689
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm just worried about you.
