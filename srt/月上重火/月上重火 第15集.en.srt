2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 15

4
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,669
I should

5
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,750
share your concerns and burdens.

6
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,240
Tou.

7
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,600
The Heaven Worship Ceremony

8
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,720
allows of no delay.

9
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,960
The syndrome of chills and fevers

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,110
allows of no delay as well.

11
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,750
If you trust me,

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,720
you should

13
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,670
let me

14
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,720
inspect epidemic areas

15
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
for you.

16
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
I’ll search for methods

17
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,910
to alleviate the disease

18
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,240
and find the cure for it as soon as possible.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,750
Tou.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,110
Are you really willing to share my burden?

21
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,670
Go.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,240
Anyone here?

23
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,270
Go check it, Liuli.

24
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,829
Okay.

25
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,240
Leader.

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,800
The food has already gone bad.

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
There’s no one inside.

28
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,110
Who are you?

29
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,270
Are you looking for someone?

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,670
Mrs.

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,720
We just came by.

32
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Did you know where they are?

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
They are all dead.

34
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,829
The father

35
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,110
got the flu first.

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,470
Later,

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,160
they were infected one by one.

38
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,600
Within one month,

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,160
they were all dead.

40
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
You should leave now.

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,079
Nobody comes here now.

42
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,360
They’re afraid of getting the flu.

43
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,270
Thank you.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,720
You’d better leave.

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,390
Leader.

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Let’s go.

47
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,270
Let’s go.

48
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,750
Pan Gu

49
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,630
created heaven and earth.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,030
Nv Wa

51
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,079
created human beings.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,440
Grass, wood, insects and fish.

53
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,240
Flying birds and walking beasts.

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,240
All created by mandate of heaven.

55
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,080
All prosperous due to God’s will.

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,630
Today,

57
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,550
the outbreak of epidemic

58
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,270
is due to the fact that someone

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,670
peeked at fates of the world,

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,040
and

61
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,720
God lost his temper.

62
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,160
The court

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,920
wants to eliminate flood,

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,270
and govern

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,550
the Twelfth Channels

66
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,670
so as to stop

67
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,440
the natural disaster.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,670
But it never occurred to them that,

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,159
after the disaster,

70
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,640
the epidemic has been spread

71
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,790
and so many people have died.

72
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,270
This is the punishment

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,270
from God.

74
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,000
We can

75
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,270
only

76
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,390
burn them two as offerings,

77
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,270
to appease

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,950
God’s rage.

79
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,040
Burn them!

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,390
Make way.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
What’re you doing?

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,670
You spread fallacies to deceive people

83
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,790
and hurt innocent ones.

84
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,270
Who are you?

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,320
Everyone.

86
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,790
It’s definitely nonsense to kill people
to worship heaven.

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,040
Do you really believe that the flu.

88
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,110
can diminish if he kills them?

89
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,070
The flu is a disease.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,550
It’s not a monster.

91
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,200
We need doctors for curing disease.

92
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,110
You have to believe in doctors,

93
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,270
instead of this man’s ridiculous words.

94
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,440
It’s not that we don’t believe in doctors.

95
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,230
There’s no medicine

96
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,270
to cure the flu.

97
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,040
Yeah.

98
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,510
Even our doctors are infected.

99
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,600
We can only resort to God now.

100
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,760
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,760
Calm down.

102
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
Please calm down.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
Everyone.

104
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,670
The Hall of Flames

105
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,790
will find a way to cure this.

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Before we find it out,

107
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,200
please stay at home,

108
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,670
and avoid interacting with others

109
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,640
to prevent its spread.

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,390
We’ll tell you

111
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,670
when we find it.

112
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,230
Is this curable?

113
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,790
Yeah!

114
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,200
It’s not.

115
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,230
It can’t be cured.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Quiet down.

117
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,230
Yeah.

118
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,000
We have no way

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
to cure it now.

120
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,440
But it doesn’t mean

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
we won’t be able to.

122
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,270
So, you have to trust us.

123
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,200
We’ll find a way

124
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,880
to cure the flu for you.

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,550
How?

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
Why should we believe in her?

127
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Yeah! Why?

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,230
Do you think she’s right?

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,200
Never mind. Let’s go home.

130
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,780
[The government of Peace County]

131
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,230
Master.

132
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,270
What did you get?

133
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,510
What did the magistrate say?

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,720
He says

135
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,000
they couldn’t find any reason

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
for the flu or its cure,

137
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,390
so they sent

138
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
all infected residents in the county

139
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,390
to the suburban hospitals

140
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,320
to get treatment.

141
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,200
So,

142
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
it could prevent the epidemic from spreading.

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,000
No wonder residents in the county can still live normally

144
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,480
and are not affected by the flu.

145
00:06:59,230 --> 00:06:59,760
Master.

146
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,510
Why didn’t you

147
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,350
visit the magistrate yourself,

148
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,600
but sent me instead?

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,110
I’m not an official from the court,

150
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,880
and I don’t want to deal with them either.

151
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,720
I’m here to share my father’s burden.

152
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,230
I had no intention to face these people.

153
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,070
I thought that

154
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,790
since the flu would

155
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,000
go viral like this,

156
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,000
Peace County would

157
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,270
have so many casualties like others.

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,110
Master.

159
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,720
Shall we go seek for information separately?

160
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,320
Okay.

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
Perhaps, we would gain more information.

162
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,320
Did you know

163
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,040
what day it is today?

164
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Today’s Qiqiao Festival.

165
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,640
Ladies would

166
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,200
write their good wishes for life

167
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
on river lamps.

168
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,790
River lamps will

169
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,760
take their wishes to far away.

170
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,390
Some people would

171
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,200
put their names and their loved ones’

172
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,510
in river lamps,

173
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,440
hoping they could

174
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,160
deliver their love

175
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,230
to the people they love.

176
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,960
Yeah?

177
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,200
Then, I want to make a wish.

178
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,230
Good.

you really know something.

188
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,030
This is the last

189
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,590
rabbit lamp left.

190
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,840
Yeah,

191
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
I want this rabbit lamp.

192
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, it’s 30 coppers.

A moment.

Okay.

I know you were born in the year of Rabbit.

I bought this specially for you.

How did you know?

200
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,910
I guessed.

Lady?

My mom

219

My dad said

saying my wish towards a flower lamp

222
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,400
will help me realize my wish.

223
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,110
I want to make a wish.

224
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,150
So my mom would recover soon.

225
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,030
But,

by a sir just now.

236
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,710
how about other lamps?

I hope

241
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,350
you can make my mom recover from the flu,

242

and get better soon.

this rabbit lamp?

250
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,960
A brother gave it to me.

the flower lamp

254

people there would cure my mom.

I can’t go there,

this little rabbit can hear me?

definitely hears you.

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,070
You two go to Qingxi Village now

357
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,800
and see if we can find any clue.

358
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,160
-Okay.
-Yes.

359
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,590
What about you?

360
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,520
I have to stay and take care of them.

361
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,470
Okay.

362
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,160
Have a safe journey.

363
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,190
Okay.

364
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,590
I thought you wouldn’t come back.

365
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,350
How could I not come back?

Master Shangguan.

370
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,280
Do you have any good ways

371
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,350
to control the epidemic?

372
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,950
There is no way

373
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,070
to cure the flu now.

374
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,430
But I’ve sent people

375
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,160
to the Moon Valley for Herbal Medicine Master.

376
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
He’s experienced at this.

00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,830
Do you have any good ways?

379
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,160
I wish I had.

380
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,070
My prescription can only help alleviate it.

381
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,470
And

382
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,190

nothing left in the hospital.

384
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,590
Does your prescription

385
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,350
really alleviate it?

386
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,760
Yeah.

387
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,680
Okay.

388
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,190
Give me your prescription, I’ll go buy them.

389

Hello,

407
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,310
why’s your medicine so expensive?

408
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,800
Medicine has become rare lately.

409
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,000
I have no way out.

410
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,230
This is the fixed price.

411
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,430
Rare?

412
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,830
There so much of them here.

You can go somewhere else.

416
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,920
This is fixed price.

I have no way out.

Please lower it a little bit.

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,830
I’m pissed off.

420
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Why?

421
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,350
The price of the medicine in the county has gone up.

422
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,680
But I didn’t have enough money.

That’s all I could afford.

424

never enough

for people here.

427
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,230
Why has it gone up?

428
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,190
They raised the price randomly

429
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,470
since they saw the epidemic has become rampant.

430
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,640
They’re taking advantages

We’ve gone so far.

Shouldn’t we find a place for them to take a rest?

No.

come with me and help me?

are you feeling unwell?

451

Stop it.

464
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,680
I’ve seen your daughter.

Her name is Ying.

466
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,000
Where did you see her?

467
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,760
She kneeled on the floor

468
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,920
everyday

469
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,560

She hopes you can recover soon.

can you offer her a complete home.

Master Shangguan.

479

Why did you give me your inner strength?

480
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,470
Because I said

481
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,680
I would protect you.

482
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Why did you decide this for me?

483
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,950
Did you know

484
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
what you did

485
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,950
would make me feel I owe you?

486
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,950
Since you owe me,

487
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
pay me back slowly.

488
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,310
Since the day we met,

489
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,400
I have been owing to you all along.

490
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,680
Till now,

491
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,920
I can’t remember how many times you helped me.

492
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Master Shangguan,

493
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,110
do you remember

494
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
my commitment to you??

495
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,680
After this is finished,

496
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,760
I have to ask you

497
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,560
for payback.

498
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,640
What do you want? Just name it.

499
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,160
After we made it,

500
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,280
I want something

501
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
that is most important to you.

502
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
No problem. I promise.

503
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,590
You said

504
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,000
I should give you something

505
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,350
most important to me.

506
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,310
But till now,

507
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
you haven’t told me what you want.

508
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
Actually, I had never wanted

509
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,920
anything from you.

510
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,710
At that time,

511
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,310
I protected you as Mr. Lin had asked.

512
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,040
But I hardly knew you.

513
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,280
So,

514
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,800
I wanted to try

515
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,190
if you were the one

516
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,280
who deserved my protection.

517
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,760
You promised me so quickly.

518
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,710
Few people

519
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,110
have such decisiveness.

520
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
So, Miss Chong,

521
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,350
you owe me nothing.

522
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,280
Don’t take it seriously.

523
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,280
I have imagined so many times

524
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,950
how we would reunite.

525
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,800
I imagined that

527
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,950
when I encountered difficulties.

528
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,640
I also imagined that

529
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,230
we reunited

530
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,190
after we grew old.

531
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,110
I even imagined that

532
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
you already married someone.

533
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,430
But this reunion

534
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,760
is not what I expected.

535
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,920
To me,

536
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
this moment

537
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,950
is the best arrangement,

538
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
and this is the most unusual reunion.

539
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,950
The medicine is ready. I’ll check on that.

540
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,950
Why are there

541
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,350
so many tombs?

542
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,280
The Leader said

543
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,800
few people were alive.

544
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,540
[Zhang Shizhong]

545
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,310
A lot of people died,

546
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,280
so they were buried together.

547
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,520
But…

548
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,280
this is too terrifying.

549
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,590
Let’s go.

550
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,520
Let’s go inside.

551
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,140
[Qingxi]

552
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,430
There’s really no one here.

553
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
How could we investigate it

554
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,680
since there’s no one here?

555
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,190
We’ll have to start from the sources of

556
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,920
water and food.

557
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,800
Okay.

558
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,280
Zhusha.

559
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,160
Don’t you think this is too quiet?

560
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,400
No one is here.

561
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,520
Of course it’s quiet.

562
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,710
I’m saying

563
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,680
there’s not even a bird’s chirp.

564
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Perhaps

565
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,160
even animals have difficulties in

566
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,280
living here?

567
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,280
Zhusha.

568
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,160
Take a look.

569
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,520
This chicken died abnormally.

570
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,430
Is it because of the flu?

571
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,950
Infected by people?

572
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,590
Not necessarily.

573
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,950
If it’s not from human to fowls,

574
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
then it’s likely to be from fowls to human.

575
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,520
The origin of the flu

576
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,950
is fowls.

577
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,800
This chicken died because it ate a centipede.

578
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,280
There’s something wrong

579
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,000
with the centipede?

580
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,640
Let’s take it back.

581
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,680
We shouldn’t stay for too long. Let’s go.

582
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,190
Okay.

583
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,280
It’s

584
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,800
not enough.

585
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,160
We should have more of them

586
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,230
to deal with emergency.

587
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,760
Leader.

588
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,110
Leader.

589
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,710
I got the news that the flu got to

590
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,110
places near the Sword Manor.

591
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,400
It’s just started.

592
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,470
I have control of

593
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,710
the whole world.

594
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,800
Now, only Shangqing Sect and Emei Sect

595
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,920
are left.

596
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,280
But,

597
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,160
they’re doomed.

598
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Take this

599
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
to

600
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,920
Shangqing Sect.

601
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,160
Yeah.

602
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,230
Feng She.

603
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,190
Take the flu

604
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,160
to Emei Sect.

605
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,710
Yeah.

606
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,590
But Leader,

607
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,000
I don’t understand.

608
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,280
Luduan Temple is a major sect.

609
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,070
Why don’t we spread the flu to Luduan Temple?

610
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,830
You’re being silly.

611
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,000
The flu is spread by fowls.

612
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,350
Those monks are vegetarians.

613
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,160
Go.

614
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,640
Yeah.

615
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,400
Wait a minute.

616
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,430
If you fail at this mission,

617
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,000
you know the consequence.

618
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,640
Yeah.

619
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,590
Bring some water and staple food.

620
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
Cheer them up.

621
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,760
Yeah.

622
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,880
Alert.

623
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,110
Sir.

624
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,350
Do you have water?

625
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Here is water.

626
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,040
Thank you.

627
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,920
I’m sorry.

628
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,640
What’s wrong with you?

629
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,230
We

630
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,070
got the flu.

631
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,350
The flu?

632
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,160
Why don’t you go to the doctor?

633
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,160
Doctor?

634
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,950
I’m afraid

635
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,070
they can’t save themselves.

636
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,590
The disease

637
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,760
spreads

638
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,000
so fast.

639
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,760
So,

640
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,640
why don’t you stay at home and rest?

641
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,520
We have to run away.

642
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,920
Does that work?

643
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,760
God has

644
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,110
sent plague

645
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,470
here

646
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,520
to punish us.

647
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,710
If we can run away,

648
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,920
we would…

649
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,400
we would…

650
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,710
we would rid of the disease.

651
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
You should go back quickly.

652
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,920
Only when you save your life

653
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,920
can you cure your disease.

654
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,920
Running away

655
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,160
won’t work.

656
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,880
Thank you.

657
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,430
Thank you.

658
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,640
Let’s go.

659
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Thank you.

660
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,280
Qingmei.

661
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,520
Is this really where the epidemic happened?

662
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
It doesn’t look like that.

663
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,920
Yeah.

664
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,680
It looks peaceful here.

665
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,880
Did father

666
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,950
receive fake news?

667
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
I wouldn’t think so.

668
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,040
Since he thinks

669
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,430
we can find the cure here,

670
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,800
then we will.

671
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,000
But

672
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,430
where should we start?

673
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,640
Let’s look around

674
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,430
and then make a decision.

675
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,150
How about this?

676
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,190
Let’s take actions separately.

677
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,469
We’ll be reunited here in half an hour.

678
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,320
No.

679
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,909
You can’t act alone.

680
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,190
I’ll be worried.

681
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,710
That’s not important in front of a hard task.

682
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:18,870
Moreover,

683
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,080
I’m not a kid any more.

684
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
No one can hurt me.

685
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,040
See you in half an hour.

686
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,710
Fengzi.

687
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,230
Fengzi!

688
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,909
Take care!

689
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,909
I heard that

690
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,320
fewer people died

691
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,630
after Master Shangguan went to the hospital.

692
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
Really?

693
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,800
Is it because

694
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
he has found the cure?

695
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,710
I hope so.

696
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,520
Were you referring to Shangguan Tou?

697
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,670
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

698
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,670
Where’s he now?

699
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,630
At the hospital in the east.

700
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,360
Yeah.

701
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,040
But I should remind you that…

702
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,670
Why are you outside?

703
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,710
I’ll help you.

704
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,190
I’m fine. You haven’t recovered yet.

705
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,390
It’s okay.

706
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,910
Miss Chong.

707
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
