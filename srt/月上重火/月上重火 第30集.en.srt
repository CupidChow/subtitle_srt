00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,270
where his root is?

6
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,740
All the lands under the heaven

7
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,440
belong to our empire.

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,930
As the Imperial Advisor, he should

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,260
put the national foundation at first place.

10
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,290
What is national foundation?

11
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
To protect the livelihood

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,630
with strict laws.

13
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,620
As an important official,

our Imperial Advisor

15
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,450
allowed Shangguan Tou

16
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,610
to rule and dominate the Moon Valley.

17
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
What does he think of the officials?

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
As an elder official,

19
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,550
our Imperial Advisor

20
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
supports the martial arts world

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,750
to be independent and run wild.

22
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,600
What does he think of the laws?

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
Although I’m weak

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,760
and can’t go to the battlefield,

25
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,720
my will of serving the country is still firm.

26

I swear to establish a well ordered empire,

28

obey the laws of government by my hands,

get rid of the miasma

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,240
of martial artists for hundreds of years.

32
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,360
I need to let them know

33
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,800
whose land they are standing on

34
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,829
and whose heaven they are living under.

35
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,030
I have to let everyone know

36
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
what is supreme.

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,210
It’s not money or power,

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,270
but the order.

39
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,079
Your Highness,

40
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,100

Sir,

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,040
I hate being misunderstood the most in my life.

44
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,000
I have a word

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,190
for you to remember.

46
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,110
My ambition in my life

47
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,920
is not to capture anything from my brother,

48
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,160
but to seek

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,950
the truth from my heart.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,270
When my brother inherits the throne,

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,790
I can give him

52
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,390
an empire in order.

53
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,840
Isn’t it for the benefit

54
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,200

Yes.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720

[Imperial Advisor’s Mansion]

87
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,040
Looks like

88
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,950
Lord Lu has made up his mind

89
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,160
to encroach on the martial arts world.

90
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,760
For hundreds of years,

91
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,090
the martial artists have their own sects.

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,200
They have been

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,450
the wealthy class for many dynasties.

94
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,440
And many heroes

95
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,690
come from the martial art circle.

96
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,950
If there is no martial art in the world,

97
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,680
it’ll will be the same as people lose their pride.

98
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,880

99
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,510

101

The world can lose the martial art,

102
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,040
but it can’t lose the order.

103

Father, you mean

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,330
you agree with Lord Lu?

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,670
Lord Lu’s thought

106
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,000
is not wrong.

107
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,240
You and I are not in his place,

108

we can’t make comments at will.

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,510
Maybe to Lord Lu,

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,270
it’s not a good thing to let

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
martial arts world develop itself.

112
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,110
In that case,

113
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,790
all the people in martial arts world

00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,600
need to obey him

and serve him?

116
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,610
That’s also not right.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,060
The government and martial art world

118
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,110
are like in a chess game

119
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,390
with advance and retreat.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,830
Chess?

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,060
No wonder Lord Lu tested me in the chess game.

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Yes.

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,550
The ancients used to play chess

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,350
instead of fighting by force,

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,909
which condensed a lot of truths.

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,370
I have to remind you that

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,000
there are two ways for you to stop Lord Lu.

128
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,480
First,

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,270
fight with him,

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and you may die.

131
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,110
Second,

132
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
play chess with him

133
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,830
and win unconsciously.

134
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,550
He is the prince

135
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,610
while I’m an ordinary person.

136
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,390
How could I win him?

137
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,750
The biggest advantage of Lord Lu

138
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,760
is that he has prepared his own

139
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,950
pieces in advance,

140
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,550
and you are

141
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,320
empty handed now.

142
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
If you want to break through,

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,550
you have to find your own piece first.

144
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
My piece?

145
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,669
Who is it?

146
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,940
I, your father,

147
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,110
am your piece.

148
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,520
Are the weapons delivered?

149
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,590
It’s escorted by Leader Chong and Chief Guardian.

150
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,250
I think it’s absolutely safe.

151
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
By the way,

152
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,530
Leader Chong ordered me to deliver a word.

153
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,320
Go ahead.

154
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,790
Leader Chong said

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,770
please take good care of her uncle.

156
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,880
Get it. Thanks.

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,960
Xuezhi,

158
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,320
you want me to leave Dongdu

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,980
and go back to Moon Valley?

160
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,440
I know

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,860
that you are still thinking of me.

162
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,710
But now I can’t go back.

163
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,710
I will find out the truth for you.

164
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,840
I won’t allow anyone to hurt you again.

165
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,440
Release!

166
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,760
Go!

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,350
You wait here.

168
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
I’ll go have a check with Leader.

169
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,320
What to do now?

170
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,790
We lost all Mo Knives.

171
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,540
This can’t be an accident.

172
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,010
It must be a trapped set by someone.

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What can we do now?

174
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,320
The remaining number of knives

175
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,150
falls far short of the quantity we should deliver.

176
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,110
And Mo Knives are our painstaking efforts.

177
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,510
We have to find them back.

178
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,670
We can’t.

179
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
We are in the light

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,320
and the enemy is in the dark.

181
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
If we keep finding,

182
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,470
I’m afraid we will fall in their traps.

183
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,710
What's more, tomorrow is the delivery date.

184
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,910
It's already too late

185
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,010
Then, what to do?

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,200
Give them the remaining knives first.

187
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
As for the others,

188
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,600
let’s see if we can resupply them later.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,660
That’s what we can only do now.

190
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,150
Sir,

191
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
there are three hundred in all.

192
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,150
What?

193
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,350
Three hundred?

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,770
What about the rest?

195
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,320
Sir,

196
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
we encountered sneak attack on the way

197
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
and the rest of the knives were robbed.

198
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,150
Robbed?

199
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,880
Guards!

200
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,910
Sir,

201
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,880
what do you mean?

202
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,640
You failed to complete the military order,

203
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
of course you will be punished.

204
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,440
But, sir,

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,150
we didn’t mean to disobey the order.

206
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,080
It’s really an accident caused by thieves.

207
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,410
This is military order.

208
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,370
No more excuses.

209
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,910
You lost the knives.

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,440
It’s your mistake on the way of escorting.

211
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
It’s not my business.

212
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,350
Sir,

213
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,110
please

214
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,280
give us one month.

215
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,000
We will

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,470
resupply you the rest of them in a month.

217
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,400
Is that alright?

218
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,790
This is the order from government.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you want to argue,

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,330
go to see the officials.

221
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,960
I’m only responsible for execution.

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,400
Take them down!

223
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,960
Sir!

224
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,110
Sir!

225
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,670
For the sake of Hall of Flames’s

226
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,400
continuous supply of weapons to the government,

227
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,150
three days,

228
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,400
please give us just three days

229
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,470
to find the knives back.

230
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,840
We want to redeem ourselves by good service.

231
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,520
Can we?

232
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
How do I know

233
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,520
that you are not going to escape?

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,460
Sir, rest assured.

235
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,230
I’m the Chief Guardian of Hall of Flames.

236
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,440
I’m in charge of supervising the manufacture

237
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,960
and transportation of weapons.

238
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,470
I should take the blame of this mistake.

239
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,280
So,

240
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,840
I’m willing to stay with the crime.

241
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,110
As for finding back the knives,

242
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,640
our leader can handle it on her own.

243
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,350
Muyuan!

244
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,230
One day.

245
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,350
I’ll only give you one day

246
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,680
to find the knives back.

247
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,640
But,

248
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
let me warn you first.

249
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,080
If you fail again,

250
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,840
both of you will still be punished.

251
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,660
Thanks for your kindness.

252
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,320
Sir,

253
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,990
please let me discuss it with my leader.

254
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,710
Leader,

255
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,350
you saw this.

256
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,200
I believe you also know that

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,880
we can do nothing

258
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,470
within a day.

259
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,380
So, leave me alone.

260
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,400
Take our people and leave now.

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,320
Don’t go back to Hall of Flames.

262
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,470
Just go as far as you can.

263
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,030
Muyuan,

264
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,680
I will never give you up.

265
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,790
Xuezhi,

266
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,590
you are the leader now.

267
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,400
Don’t act rashly.

268
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,260
Our people’s lives

269
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,400
are in your hands now.

270
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,560
Leader Feng, well done.

271
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,320
It’s my pleasure to do

272
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,400
My Lord a favor.

273
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,920
Chong Xuezhi is looking for the knives now.

274
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,670
If you take them with you,

275
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,090
you will be implicated.

276
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,000
You can leave it to us.

277
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,400
Then,

278
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,350
thank you.

279
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
This is a little gift from His Highness.

280
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,140
Thanks for His Highness’s kindness.

281
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,320
Stop!

282
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,150
Why do you stop me?

283
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,150
It’s out of our captain’s jurisdiction from here on.

284
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,400
Our captain ordered that

285
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,330
you can’t leave his jurisdiction.

286
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,910
How can I find

287
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,520
the stolen knives back if I can't go further?

288
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
This is the order.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,860
Please go back.

290
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,520
Who is that?

291
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,740
Leader is back!

292
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,280
-Leader.
-Leader.

293
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,520
How is it? Any clues?

294
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,440
-No.
-No…

295
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,320
I believe you also know that

296
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,110
we can do nothing

297
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,550
within a day.

298
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
So, leave me alone

299
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,540
and take our people leave now.

300
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,440
Don’t go back to Hall of Flames.

301
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,770
Just go as far as you can.

302
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,590
You can go back now

303
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,290
and tell Elder in chief

304
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,030
to take care of Hall of Flames for me.

305
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,640
Leader!

306
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,320
No!

307
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,280
Leader,

308
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,000
let’s fight with them!

309
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,670
Stop!

310
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,550
Are you disobeying me?

311
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,400
Go back!

312
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,760
Leader.

313
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,590
Go!

314
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,230
Go now!

315
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,730
I’ll go with you.

316
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,160
Muyuan.

317
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,520
Xuezhi.

318
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,750
You shouldn’t come back.

319
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
If I have to leave you here

320
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,400
and live alone,

321
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,820
I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.

322
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,680
But if you die with me,

323
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
I’ll be guiltier.

324
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,680
Muyuan,

325
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,040
since the moment I stepped into the world,

326
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,640
I have always known that

327
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
this day would come.

328
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,350
I know that

329
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,710
no matter how much I do,

330
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,600
there will always be

331
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,920
many people who want me to die.

332
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,230
What I didn't expect

333
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,120
is that I would drag you down.

334
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,830
You once said

335
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,340
to make Hall of Flames back to before.

336
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,830
Actually in my heart,

337
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,880
you have done it.

338
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
I didn’t expect

339
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,230
the Hall of Flames to return to its original glory.

340
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
I just hope

341
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,110
everyone in Hall of Flames,

342
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,680
you,

343
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,830
me,

344
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,040
Guardians

345
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,070
and other people

346
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,710
can live happily

347
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,560
in peace,

348
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,040
far away from the disputes.

349
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
If I had a choice,

350
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,350
I would not be the Leader

351
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,680
or let you be the Chief Guardian.

352
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,760
Unfortunately,

353
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,760
we can't go back to the past.

354
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,680
In fact,

355
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,950
the happiest time in my life

356
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,560
is when I go through

357
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,800
hardships with you.

358
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,950
I once swore,

359
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,950
and made the wish

360
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,040
that I can accompany you

361
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,520
all my life,

362
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,130
help you to stop all disasters,

363
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,560
help you solve all problems,

364
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,920
and make you smile

365
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,760
from the bottom of your heart every day.

366
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
You don’t know

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,110
how beautiful

368
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,760
your smile is, do you?

369
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,310
Later I thought,

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,060
even if this wish cannot be realized,

371
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,590
at least

372
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,880
I have to let you live well.

373
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,430
So

374
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,920
we can't both die here.

375
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:30,270
The knives made by Hall of Flames are really great.

376
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,560
Seems that Leader Chong has made the best use

377
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,770
of the money and craftsmen from the Shangguans.

378
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,040
It must be

379
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,160
unexpected for Leader Chong

380
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,880
that it’s always a crime whether they can

381
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,800
produce the knives or not.

382
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,640
Where is Leader Chong now?

383
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,800
She is in the prison

384
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,040
together with the Chief Guardian.

385
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,640
Does Shangguan Tou know this?

386
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,190
Shangguan Tou is the first person

387
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,280
who wants to know

388
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,520
the news of Hall of Flames.

389
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,190
Of course he will know.

390
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,040
I’d like to see

391
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,880
how Tou will

392
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,230
save her this time.

393
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,310
Do you need me to sneak into the prison

394
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,400
to save them?

395
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,950
Let me go with you.

396
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,590
Tou!

397
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Never take risks

398
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,000
unless you have to!

399
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,230
But, father,

400
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,490
it will be too late if I don’t go now.

401
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,280
Wuming,

402
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,440
you may leave first.

403
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,070
Tou,

404
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,760
tell me,

405
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,760
how much do you love that girl?

406
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,590
I would go through

407
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,420
fire and water for her.

408
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,880
I can tell

409
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,070
your feelings for her.

410
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,430
If I had had the resolution like you,

411
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,040
your mother would not have died.

412
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,830
Just leave this

413
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,110
to me.

414
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,190
Father.

415
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,800
Don’t be impulsive if it’s

416
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,430
not the last gasp.

417
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,350
The Minister of Military

418
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,350
still owes me a lot.

419
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,350
It’s time for him to pay me back.

420
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,720
Young Master,

421
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,350
Master went to beg Minister of Military.

422
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,680
He will be back soon.

423
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,160
How about we waiting for him in the room?

424
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
I’m not worried about my father.

425
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I’m thinking that

426
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,640
Lord Lu wants to use

427
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,310
the military law to kill Xuezhi.

428
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,760
What if

429
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,190
he has other plans?

430
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,350
Other plans?

431
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,520
Young Master, you are worrying that

432
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,120
Master can’t save Ms. Chong?

433
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,430
I need to go to Hedong

434
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,920
just in case.

435
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,760
Guys,

436
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,040
it’s time.

437
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,850
You should set off now.

438
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,680
Kneel!

439
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,520
Hold the execution!

440
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,430
Hold the execution!

441
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,520
Hold the execution!

442
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,860
Please take the order from Minister.

443
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,620
Take them away.

444
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,430
Yes.

445
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
Stand up.

446
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,400
Go.

447
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,160
Stop.

448
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,160
Open it.

449
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,960
Sir, are you going to do the execution here?

450
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,950
No more execution.

451
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,800
You are already dead.

452
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,250
Minister of Military ordered,

453
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,430
The leader of Hall of Flames, Chong Xuezhi,

454
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,110
Chief Guardian Yuwen Muyuan, broke the law

455
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,730
and should be executed.

456
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,920
But,

457
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,950
since Hall of Flames always provides

458
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,510
weapons to the court,

459
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
it’s your hard work and valuable service.

460
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,430
So your lives are spared this time.

461
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,630
We now remove your identities of leader

462
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,950
of Hall of Flames and Chief Guardian

463
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,290
and you are demoted to anonymous.

464
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,880
Unlock the shackles.

465
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,950
You are really lucky.

466
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,590
Someone big from the government is protecting you.

467
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,350
Sir,

468
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,760
can you tell me who is it?

469
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,680
I only take the orders.

470
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
By the way,

471
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,650
although you are free now,

472
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,160
you are already dead.

473
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,040
I hope that you will remain incognito

474
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,360
and not appear in the public

475
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,350
to avoid any accident.

476
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,740
Thank you, sir.

477
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,190
Thanks.

478
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,950
Go now.

479
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,880
Wuming,

480
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,880
take care of Ms. Chong for me.

481
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,320
Young Master,

482
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,060
don’t you want to escort them on your own?

483
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,760
Now

484
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,190
I can’t meet her.

485
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,350
Why?

486
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,070
It’s not the best time.

487
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,280
If it’s because Muyuan,

488
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,180
I can help you to get rid of him.

489
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,650
It’s not about him.

490
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,430
The moment when I

491
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,190
decided to fight against Lord Lu,

492
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,760
I have already been in danger.

493
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Ms. Chong

494
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,810
just escaped from danger.

495
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,040
I can’t let her

496
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,800
back to danger

497
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,830
again for me.

498
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,870
Young Master,

499
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,520
why don’t you take Ms. Chong away?

500
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,070
You have done a lot for her.

501
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,660
But you never tell her anything about it.

502
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,800
Young Master,

503
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
why bother to be

504
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,760
so cruel to yourself?

505
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,150
It’s better to forget

506
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,230
rather than to stay together.

507
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,020
Your Highness.

508
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,070
Chong Xuezhi and Yuwen Muyuan

509
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
have been saved.

510
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
It’s a capital crime.

511
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,230
Who saved them?

512
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,430
I heard that

513
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,110
two days ago,

514
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,110
Advisor went to see Minister of Military.

515
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,290
I guess he begged him to spare Hall of Flames,

516
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,610
so the two of them

517
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,680
can escape from the crime luckily.

518
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,400
Seems that

519
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,780
we still have a long way

520
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,240
to go on the matter of Chong Xuezhi.

521
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,020
Your Highness,

522
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,830
can you decide

523
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,160
whom to give the knives to now?

524
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:04,090
I still need to think about it.

525
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,710
Haven’t you made up your mind long ago?

526
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,920
The Advisor

527
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,430
is the backer of Shangguan Tou,

528
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,280
also the backer

529
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,280
of Hall of Flames and the whole martial art world.

530
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Your Highness, please think about it.

531
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,070
If Imperial Advisor is in the way,

532
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,800
do you think

533
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,760
we can manage it

534
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,800
with only a Feng Mo?

535
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,560
If so,

536
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,920
then please

537
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,520
carry out my plan

538
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,070
as we proposed before.

539
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes, Your Highness.

540
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,050
Xuezhi, have you wondered

541
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,920
who saved us?

542
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,230
Maybe it’s

543
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,560
some kind person whom we

544
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,690
once helped before.

545
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,990
Actually, you know clearly that

546
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,710
this kind person

547
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,000
is Shangguan Tou,

548
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,350
right?

549
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,590
Muyuan,

550
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,330
have you ever wondered

551
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,460
who tried to frame the Hall of Flames?

552
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,880
So far,

553
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,280
only one is suspicious.

554
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,640
Lord Lu.

555
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,950
I really want to ask him face to face

556
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,560
why he wants to frame us.

557
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,190
Will he put all those

558
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,110
who can’t be used by him to death?

559
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,430
Don’t think about questioning him face to face

560
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,640
when we have no evidence at all.

561
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,160
Even if we have evidence,

562
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,880
with our power,

563
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,200
how can we fight against the current government?

564
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,280
But don't you think

565
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,590
all the things

566
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,160
that happened recently are too coincidental?

567
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,800
If we were not framed…

568
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,070
But Xuezhi,

569
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,280
now we

570
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,430
are two dead people.

571
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,010
If we keep trying to get to the root of the matter,

572
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,150
we may not even be able to be dead.

573
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,160
What’s more,

574
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,890
I don’t want to see you in danger again.

575
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,110
What Lord Lu wants is

576
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,430
us submitting

577
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
to humiliation

578
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,110
and reconciling.

579
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,830
I can submit to humiliation

580
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,410
and reconcile to it.

581
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,710
But I think that

582
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,400
before we disappear,

583
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,400
we should go back to Hall of Flames

584
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,200
and give others an explanation.

585
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,310

you still

587
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,410
worry about Hall of Flames.

588
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,160
So do I.

00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,590
Elder couldn’t accept it

699
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,240
and committed suicide.

700
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,280
Father.

701
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,430
Tou.

702
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,710
You may leave now.

703
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,280
Yes.

704
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,000
Tou.

705
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,600
Father.

706
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,390
You’re back.

707
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,800
Did that girl get out of danger?

708
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,910
Father, thanks for help.

709
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,230
I should thank you for Xuezhi.

710
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,410
I’m afraid I don’t want

711
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,120
you to thank for her.

712
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,320
I hope you can take her back home someday

713
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,000
to thank me face to face.

714
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,390
When the matter of Lord Lu is settled,

715
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,590
I’ll take her back to meet you formally.

716
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,890
It’s hard to settle it down.

717
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,080
Have you decided?

718
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,560
Lord Lu won’t give up.

719
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,720
If we don’t finish this,

720
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,560
Xuezhi and I won’t have any peace.

721
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,000
And it will

722
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,980
also get you worried about us.

723
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,970
It’s fine for me to worry about you.

724
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,520
But I’m afraid this is too hard

725
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,040
for you to handle.

726
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,600
At present, Hall of Flames is risking their head,

727
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,630
and Huashan Sect is serving Lord Lu.

728
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,840
The other sects don’t want to get in trouble.

729
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,670
If I don’t stop him now,

730
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,470
I’m afraid the martial art world

731
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,430
will be in his hands soon.

732
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,390
There will be no peace

733
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,800
at that time.

734
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,230
Lord Lu is too stubborn.

735
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,670
He will get himself trapped one day.

736
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,390
I’m afraid

737
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
it will be hard for your sister at that time.

738
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,260
Father, don’t worry about it.

739
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,430
Although Lord Lu is stubborn,

740
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,000
he still deeply loves my sister.

741
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,390
I believe that he won’t hurt her.

742
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,230
I hope so.

743
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,000
Lord Lu is noble.

744
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,840
I wonder why he bypasses the government

745
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,010
and steps into martial art world.

746
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,920
After I thought about it,

747
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,120
I still don’t want you to be at risk.

748
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,120
What’s more,

749
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,420
that girl just got out of trouble.

750
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,460
She needs to hide from others.

751
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
This is a good time

752
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,190
for you two to be off to distant parts.

753
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,390
As for Lord Lu,

754
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,000
I’m still in his way.

755
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,150
I think his hand will not

756
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,000
reach you for a while.

757
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,960
Father, how could I do that?

758
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,260
I can’t be that selfish

759
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,250
to leave you alone against Lord Lu.

760
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You have just rescued

761
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,430
the condemned criminals in person this time.

762
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,470
I think Lord Lu has heard about this.

763
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,210
I’m afraid he will also

764
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,840
aim at you.

765
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,000
I have been serving the court for years.

766
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,600
I have seen so many different kinds of attacks.

767
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,200
Although Lord Lu is fierce,

768
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,470
he is still young.

769
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,190
Anyway,

770
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,090
I’m still the Imperial Advisor

771
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,690
and his father-in-law.

772
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,230
I think

773
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,950
he won’t kill me at least.

774
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,760
But you…

775
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,840
What he wants now is to wipe out Hall of Flames.

776
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,710
But you are stopping him from doing that.

777
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,820
You are in more dangerous situation.

778
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,410
Father, rest assured.

779
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,000
I never served the government.

780
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
But I

781
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
grew up seeing how you did things

782
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,000
I also learned something from you.

783
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,190
I think it’s

784
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,930
not that easy for Lord Lu to hurt me.

785
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,520
Since you have made your decision,

786
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,080
I won’t persuade you again.

787
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,840
I just want to remind you

788
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,960
that no matter what happens,

789
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,800
don’t deal with it alone.

790
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,280
If we team up,

791
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,230
we will get more leeway.

792
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,600
I got it.

793
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:47,220
[Elder Yuwen Zhongsong of Hall of Flames]

794
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,720
Sorry, Grandfather.

795
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,840
I feel so guilty that

796
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,760
I didn’t let you see me for the last time.

797
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,800
I know that

798
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,060
you always regarded me

799
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,910
as the only hope

800
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,510
of Yuwen Family in your life.

801
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,470
But, I’m sorry, grandfather.

802
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,840
I have let you down.

803
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,520
I’m incapable

804
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,950
and failed to live up to your expectations.
