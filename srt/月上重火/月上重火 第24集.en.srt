00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 24

4
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,230
The Nine Moves of Lotus God

5
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,360
does belong to the Hall of Flames,

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but because the manual was stolen years ago,

7
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,080
there’re other people that know it

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
apart from me.

9
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,079
Also, when the murder happened,

10
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,440
I was still back at the Hall of Flames.

11
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,390
How could I pull it off here
at Winehouse of Fairyland?

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,470
Do you have any evidence

13
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,910
to support what you said?

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,960
Your honor,

15
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,240
I’m the Chief Guardian of the Hall of Flames,

16
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,079
I can testify for her.

17
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,079
You’re also from the Hall of Flames,

18
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,440
so your testimony is invalid.

19
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Chong Xuezhi,

20
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,320
you keep defending yourself

21
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,600
but you have no evidence.

22
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,550
I find you hard to be trusted.

23
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,800
Sir.

24
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,160
Since you’re so certain that

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,670
he died of the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,270
What you don’t know is that

27
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,750
anyone who died of the Nine Moves

28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,720
has a mark on them.

29
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,470
Are we allowed to

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,830
operate an autopsy?

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
OK.

32
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,520
We’ve got the body.
I’m not afraid of a confrontation.

33
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,470
Soldiers.

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
Bring the body here.

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,320
Your honor.

36
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,079
There’s something wrong with the body.

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,270
What?

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,110
Your honor.

39
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,270
He didn’t die of the Nine Moves.

40
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,630
What?

41
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,440
There’s a distinctive lotus mark

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,320
on the man’s neck.

43
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,390
What killed him

44
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,520
if he didn’t die of the Nine Moves?

45
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,520
This is firm evidence.

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you trying to deny it?

47
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Your honor.

48
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,830
Anyone who dies of the Nine Moves of Lotus God

49
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,190
does have a lotus mark on them

50
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,360
but this lotus mark wasn’t

51
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,230
caused by the Nine Moves.

52
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,390
How-how do you know?

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,350
Your honor.

54
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,350
Please take a closer look at the mark.

55
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,040
And?

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
Anyone who dies of the Nine Moves of Lotus God

57
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,920
does have a lotus mark on them.

58
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
That’s because the blood coagulates.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
The blood in the meridians get converged.

60
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,320
But sir,

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,830
please take a closer look.

62
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,200
The lotus mark on him

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,350
has a swollen scab.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
It doesn’t look like the coagulation of blood,

65
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,670
but more like a burn

66
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,880
he got before he died.

67
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,480
You take a little scab

68
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,950
for your evidence?

69
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,790
How do I know

70
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,350
if it isn’t an excuse of yours?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
Your honor.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,510
Everybody

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,600
in the martial world

74
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,390
knows that anyone dies of the Nine Moves

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,040
will have a lotus mark on the neck.

76
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,070
But almost no one knows

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,110
how big the lotus mark is

78
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
or the color and the cause to it.

79
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,510
So I’m sure that

80
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,070
the murderer must have falsified

81
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,880
the cause of death

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,070
to frame us.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Yes. Your honor.

84
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,200
The Nine Moves of Lotus God is powerful.

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,070
Sorry that I can’t demonstrate here.

86
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,110
But I swear with my life

87
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,670
that the lotus mark on him

88
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,159
wasn’t caused by the Nine Moves.

89
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,920
Please be fair and wise, sir.

90
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,670
Uh...

91
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,880
Lean in.

92
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,720
Your honor.

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,550
-Uh...
-Go!

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,110
Yes.

95
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,000
Kneel!

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,880
Have mercy, my lord.

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,160
This man

98
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,830
brutally slaughtered

99
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,600
three people living next door for revenge.

100
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,830
He’s already got a death sentence

101
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,950
and will be beheaded when the fall comes.

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,110
Since

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,160
he’s going to die anyway,

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
you might as well

105
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,040
test the Nine Moves on him

106
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,070
to show me.

107
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,070
Let’s see

108
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,830
if Chong Xuezhi is telling the truth.

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,480
Your honor.

110
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
The Nine Moves of Lotus God
is very powerful,

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,320
I can’t do this to a living person.

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,070
It is cruel.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,880
But it can prove

115
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,510
whether you’re telling the truth or not.

116
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,230
If this can prove

117
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,760
that you didn’t kill the man,

118
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,790
I’ll make sure that justice is served.

119
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,159
And your name will be cleared.

120
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
If you say no,

121
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,350
and keep being evasive,

122
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,160
I’ll think

123
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,510
that everything you said earlier

124
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,550
is but garbage.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Then I’ll be merciless.

126
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,230
You’ll be sentenced as a murderer.

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,270
Your honor.

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
He committed a felony.

129
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,000
The Imperial Court

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,550
has the right to punish him.

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,790
If we were to prove our innocence

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,550
by killing a man in court,

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,760
then we would break the law.

134
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,070
So

135
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,350
please think it over.

136
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,640
Right. Your honor,

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,950
as a Magistrate,

138
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,070
how can you be so indiscreet?

139
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,440
Insolent!

140
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Well, well, well.

141
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,390
Since you two disagree,

142
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,600
then

143
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,760
I won’t force you.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,640
Soldiers,

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,550
lock Chong Xuezhi up

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,510
for further interrogation.

147
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,270
Chief Guardian.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,350
The most important thing right now

149
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,320
is to clear Xuezhi’s name.

150
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,510
Should you set aside the personal grudge

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,550
to listen to me?

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
I have a way to save Xuezhi,

153
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,320
but I’ll need your help.

154
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,320
Quick!

155
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,040
Move fast.

156
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,640
OK.

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,000
Quick!

158
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,720
Hurry the hell up!

159
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
The authority is sniffing around!

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,830
Feng Mo!

161
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,600
Dad asked me stall Chong Xuezhi.

162
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,600
She was locked up in jail today.

163
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
Quickly! Bury him.

164
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,030
Where are you going?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,960
My master invites you over for tea.

166
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,910
Please.

167
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Chief Guardian.

168
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Chief Guardian.

169
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,350
Chief Guardian.

170
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,550
And you are...

171
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I’m from Xiangzhou.

172
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,350
I was sent here by a man of status.

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,550
Xiangzhou.

174
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,110
Yes.

175
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,440
Do you work for Lord Lu?

176
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,840
Yes.

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,710
Shangguan Tou.

178
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,280
Shangguan Tou.

179
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,320
Let me go!

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,150
Shangguan Tou.

181
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
What do you want?

182
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,030
Let me go! Now!

183
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,910
Master.

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,590
You are right.

185
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
The man didn’t die of the Nine Moves.

186
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,470
Shangguan Tou.

187
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,710
I’m talking to you!

188
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,520
Did you hear me?

189
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
He died of the thump
on the back of the head.

190
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,840
The lotus mark was counterfeited.

191
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,880
Feng Mo.

192
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,760
Although I never thought you were smart,

193
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,200
I didn’t expect you

194
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
to be so dumb.

195
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,760
I can’t believe you murdered a peer

196
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,640
to frame the Hall of Flames.

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
What are you talking about?

198
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I don’t have a clue.

199
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,320
It’s fine.

200
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,030
I’ve got a coroner for an autopsy.

201
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,440
And I’ll turn in the autopsy report
to the magistrate.

202
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,910
By then,

203
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,150
it doesn’t matter
whether you have a clue or not.

204
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,640
Impossible.

205
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,280
Zhang Shan’s family didn’t ask the authority
for an autopsy.

206
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,550
This is a private autopsy

207
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,710
which can’t be served as evidence.

208
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,230
Is that so?

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
You did offer them

210
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,350
a good amount of taels.

211
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,440
But

212
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
if they have to face the charges of

213
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
corpse trafficking or

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,230
destroying the evidence

215
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,640
or hindering investigation,

216
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,000
do you think

217
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,030
they’d still like it?

218
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
Zhang Shan’s family admitted

219
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,960
that they took his money.

220
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,400
What is the purpose of

221
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
all the things that you’ve done?

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,880
Chief Guardian.

223
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
He refuses to talk.

224
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,030
Then we’ll

225
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,030
help him.

226
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,900
[Suzhou Government Office]

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Miss Chong.

228
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,350
According to the autopsy report,

229
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,320
Zhang Shan wasn’t killed by the Nine Moves.

230
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,790
It was a willful frame-up.

231
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,910
The dead man’s family has also admitted

232
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,150
that they took the money from Huashan Sect.

233
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,790
That’s why they refused an autopsy.

234
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,470
But

235
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,590
because they are afraid of Huashan Sect,

236
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,760
they’ve decided

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
to drop the charges.

238
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,280
The case is closed.

239
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,590
You’re free to go.

240
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,960
Thank you, your honor.

241
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
Miss Chong.

242
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,520
Wuming.

243
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
Your master sent you over?

244
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,080
Yes.

245
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,150
My master is with Chief Guardian Muyuan.

246
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,030
He asked to me invite you over.

247
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,960
Why are they together?

248
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,840
Master,

249
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,400
it doesn’t work.

250
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,880
It stinks.

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,110
And?

252
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,590
Or you can kill him.

253
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,710
Feng Mo.

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
Speak.

255
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,840
Yes, Mr. Feng.

256
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,760
Please. Just speak.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
What are you doing?

258
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,030
Xuezhi.

259
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,400
Since you’re OK now,

260
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,590
I’ll be gone.

261
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,550
I leave

262
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,710
the person to you.

263
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,710
Let’s go, Wuming.

264
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,710
Wait a minute.

265
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,550
Thank you for clearing her name.

266
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,790
We owe

267
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,640
you another one.

268
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,080
So how

269
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,440
are you going to repay me?

270
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,150
You can ask for anything.

271
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,110
Except for Xuezhi.

272
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,760
I need nothing.

273
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,520
Except for Xuezhi.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,350
Very classy of you.

275
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,910
So?

276
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Have you cleared the air with Xuezhi?

277
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,230
No.

278
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,150
But the murder of Huashan disciple

279
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,150
was settled.

280
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,790
Who did it?

281
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,520
The Huashan Sect did it themselves.

282
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,910
They wanted to frame the Hall of Flames.

283
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,590
Why did they do this?

284
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,440
Well,

285
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,960
Feng Cheng killed his own disciple

286
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,350
and imputed the murder
to the Hall of Flames.

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
They must be up to no good

288
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,030
with all the things they’ve done.

289
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,400
What’s your plan?

290
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,030
My investigation on Man Feiyue
is still ongoing.

291
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,110
I...

292
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,790
May need to stick around
for a few more days.

293
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,520
To see what Feng Cheng is up to.

294
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,150
You’re worried about Xuezhi.

295
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,350
Yet you claimed

296
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,590
that you would stay for the investigation
on Man Feiyue.

297
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,320
If she knew my heart like you do,

298
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,710
that’d be wonderful.

299
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,030
Sometimes,

300
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,880
the more you want something,

301
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,960
the more you’re scared to approach it.

302
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,550
Maybe

303
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,080
Xuezhi knows.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,520
It’s just she’s afraid to be hurt again.

305
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,200
I know.

306
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,790
Since you’re aware,

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,550
why don’t you deign yourself?

308
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,550
I’m always humble

309
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,910
with Xuezhi.

310
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,590
It’s just the current situation is complicated.

311
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,640
One affair after another.

312
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,110
I think

313
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,590
everything is targeted at Xuezhi.

314
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,710
Yet I

315
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
am clueless.

316
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
My head is in a mess.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,230
Xuezhi has been living under death threat

318
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,710
for a long time.

319
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,400
Ever since she came out,

320
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,000
there has been malice against her.

321
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,840
If you want to straighten it all out,

322
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,710
how many years

323
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,640
have you got?

324
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,000
Hongxiu,

325
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,710
you’ve got a clear mind as an onlooker.

326
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,960
You’ve complicated things yourself.

327
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Xuezhi doesn’t necessarily believe

328
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,590
what happened in Sword Manor.

329
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,950
She cares more about your explanation.

330
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,310
I know you’re aloof and haughty.

331
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,880
You’re too proud to justify yourself.

332
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,470
But this is big.

333
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,349
Even if you don’t justify yourself
to the world,

334
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,680
Xuezhi

335
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,520
should be an exception, right?

336
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,710
OK.

337
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,069
I’ll find a chance

338
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,829
to clear the air.

339
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,000
I really don’t understand

340
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,000
why Xuezhi

341
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,920
is into a dull guy like you.

342
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,710
Oh,

343
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,430
someone came to see
Chief Guardian Muyuan today.

344
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,310
Who?

345
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,950
I had a smart errand boy pry
for information.

346
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,800
But he came back with nothing.

347
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,350
Anyway, he’s a wary fellow.

348
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
They met alone?

349
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,400
Yes.

350
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,950
In Chief Guardian’s room.

351
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,590
He heard nothing.

352
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,830
Did Chief Guardian act strangely?

353
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,830
He drove the errand boy away.

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,350
I don’t know what they talked about.

355
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,710
Don’t tell Xuezhi this for now.

356
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,830
But Chief Guardian

357
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,680
is so close to Xuezhi.

358
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,830
Even if Yuwen Muyuan was a bad guy,

359
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,590
he wouldn’t harm Xuezhi.

360
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,760
About that,

361
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,950
I’m pretty sure.

362
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,470
But

363
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,590
the game

364
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
is getting more and more complicated.

365
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,230
Ever since Hero Assembly,

366
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Huashan Sect

367
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,560
has been scheming against

368
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,950
us and the Nine Moves of Lotus.

369
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,800
On the one hand, you covet the manual,

370
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,160
on the other hand,

371
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
you want to destroy the Hall of Flames.

372
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,920
This time,

373
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,590
you assaulted us

374
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
while I was away.

375
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,470
And you killed your own people

376
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,040
to frame me up.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,760
Tell me,

378
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,830
what else are you plotting?

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,350
You remembered these quite well.

380
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,040
Let me ask you.

381
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,190
Do you still remember that

382
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,040
your dad killed my grandfather?

383
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,310
You don’t?

384
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,920
I do.

385
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,640
How many times do I have to explain to you

386
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,430
that my dad killed Mr. Feng by mistake

387
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,280
because he was driven into mania.

388
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,920
Yet Huashan Sect never lets it go,

389
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,640
and never gets off our back.

390
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,040
Fine.

391
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,040
We

392
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,920
can give you a break.

393
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,000
Just give the manual of Lotus Wing to me,

394
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,470
I’ll go home and ask my dad

395
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,680
to let you go.

396
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,800
Feng Mo.

397
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,760
Can’t you read the situation here?

398
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,590
Who

399
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,560
should be begging

400
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,230
for mercy, huh?

401
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Leader.

402
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,230
In my opinion,

403
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,190
it’s a waste of time.

404
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,280
Just torture him.

405
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,160
Muyuan.

406
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,950
I don’t think

407
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,560
violence is the solution.

408
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,000
Plus,

409
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,110
my dad did

410
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,640
kill Mr. Feng.

411
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,710
I don’t want the fights
between two sects begin to escalate.

If we can

413
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,110
make him tell us the reason
why they framed us

414

in a peaceful way,

415
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,880
I think it’s for the best.

416
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
But what if

417
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,950
he doesn’t?

418
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,800
Let’s keep trying.

419
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,470
OK.

[Fortune Tavern]

If you’re tired,

just get some rest here.

425
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,470
I’ll go out to see

426

if there’s any food.

427
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,470
OK. Thanks, master.

Keep it quiet.

I saw the marks all the way.

431
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,230
What happened?

Leader Yuan.

433

The plan went wrong.

catch Feng Mo.

[Winehouse of Fairyland]

How is it going?

441
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,430

why Huashan Sect framed you up?

Feng Mo

445

still refuses to tell us

why Feng Cheng framed us.

I didn’t know

00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Feng Mo is such a good son.

449
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,190
He didn’t rat his dad out.

Feng Cheng.

455
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,560
He’s not a good son.

456
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
He’s just stupid.

457
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,560
It’s unfortunate of his dad

458

to have such a son.

459

Since when

460
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,000
did you start to hate Feng Mo so much?

461
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,680
I’ve always hated him.

462
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,040
Because he and I have the same surname.

463
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,470
Good point.

464
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,710
Your names make me wonder

They’re far worse than you.

471
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,760
Have you ever thought

472
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,040
what if he keeps his mouth shut forever?

473
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,880
I don’t know.

I’m here because the little beauty trusts me.

Done.

524
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,710
What’s done?

525
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,280
We need to question him now.

526
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,680
You knocked him out!
How am I supposed to question him?

527
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,230
Oh, I forgot that.

528
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,880
The pill needs a catalyst

529
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,560
to make it work.

530
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,040
I was being hasty.

531
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,710
But it’s OK.

532
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,560
The pill won’t kill him.

533
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,190
He’ll wake up in a few days.

534
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,040
A few days?

535
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,310
Get lost.

536
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,190
Will do.

537
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,800
Feng Mo

538
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,680
isn’t a good fellow

539
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,310
but at least he’s my brother.

540
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,430
I’m not gonna let Muyuan stab him.

541
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,070
But

542
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,950
the potency only lasts for a night.

543
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,710
I need to come up with another solution.

544
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,800
Stay put.

545
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,950
Is Feng Mo in there?

546
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,950
Yes.

547
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,070
The street at night is gorgeous.

548
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,430
We’re gonna get drunk.

549
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,920
Tou?

550
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,800
Why is he here?

551
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,470
Muyuan.

552
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,800
I shouldn’t have trusted Feng She.

553
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,470
I’m so mad.

554
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,710
Don’t be mad.

555
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,280
The top priority

556
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,070
is to wake him up.

557
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,760
Since Feng She is capable of
knocking him out,

558
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
he must have the antidote.

559
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,710
Muyuan.

560
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,680
Wait here.

561
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,950
I’ll get the antidote from Feng She.

562
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,590
Wait.

563
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,110
Do you know where he is?

564
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,920
I’ll find him at Winehouse of Fairyland.

565
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,680
OK.

566
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,430
Be safe.

567
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,110
Fengzi.

568
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,560
How about I take you out for a walk?

569
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,590
To cheer you up?

570
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
Cheer me up?

571
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,830
Master.

572
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,560
Dad is right.

573
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,190
The world is full of fun.

574
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,760
After watching so much beautiful scenery

575
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,280
these days,

576
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,760
I feel so much better now.

577
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,760
Glad to hear.

578
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,110
Oh, master.

579
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,680
Where will be our next stop?

580
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,680
Suzhou isn’t far away from here.

581
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,680
Why don’t we go to Suzhou?

582
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,190
Suzhou.

583
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,920
Suzhou that abounds with fishes and rice?

584
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes.

585
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,400
Let’s go to Suzhou then.

586
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,470
Three days later,

587
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,800
Master and Huashan Sect will attack
the Hall of Flames together.

588
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,880
What?

589
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,470
By then,

590
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,520
you must think of a way to keep Chong Xuezhi
in Suzhou

591
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,070
to make sure the attack succeeds.

592
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,000
Why do they attack the Hall of Flames?

593
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,520
Why are you so surprised?

594
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,160
Chief Feng

595
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,950
will also send someone to stall Chong Xuezhi.

596
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,560
Master is just concerned.

597
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
She wants you to think of a way.

598
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,520
Chong Xuezhi

599
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,000
mustn’t go back to the Hall of Flames.

600
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,070
Help!

601
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,950
-Help!
-Feng She!

602
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,310
Help!

603
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,110
Help!

604
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,920
Help!

605
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,520
Why are you here?

606
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,470
I can’t believe my bad luck!

607
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,040
Someone tied me up

608
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,640
as soon as you kicked me out.

609
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,470
I’ve still got a headache.

610
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,800
How come?

611
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,040
Sorry, leader.

612
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,880
I heard Feng She calling for help

613
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,560
so

614
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
I went out to help him.

615
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,350
I came back and he was gone.

616
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:32,830
Sorry.

617
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,880
Never mind.

618
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,520
It’s not your fault, Muyuan.

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,190
Lucky you.

620
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,920
You’re awake.

621
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,110
Leader Yuan.

622
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,430
Why are you here?

623
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,110
You dad assigned a task to me.

624
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,560
Thank you, Leader Yuan.

625
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,680
How come you were caught?

626
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,760
My dad asked me to falsify a death
caused by the Nine Moves

627
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,760
to keep Chong Xuezhi in Suzhou.

628
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,950
So that we can take the chance to
attack the Hall of Flames.

629
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,950
It went well

630
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,800
and Chong Xuezhi was in jail.

631
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,190
Yet Shangguan Tou came out of nowhere

632
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,070
to sabotage the plan.

633
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,190
He’s got the better of you.
Complaining is pointless.

634
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,430
OK. I got it.

635
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,280
Meet with Feng Cheng.

636
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,280
But

637
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,310
dad asked me to stall Chong Xuezhi.

638
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,310
Leave it to me.

639
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,160
Thank you, Leader Yuan.

640
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,660
[Fortune Tavern]

641
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,310
Fengzi.

642
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,760
I’ve got you a roast chicken.

643
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,950
Here. Take a bite.

644
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,680
Master.

645
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,520
What took you so long?

646
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,350
The roast chicken in the south of the city

647
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,520
tastes good.

648
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,830
I went there to buy it for you.

649
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,230
What?

650
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
You’re worried about me?

651
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,560
I saw someone when I was out there.

652
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Who?

653
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,280
Shangguan Tou.

654
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,560
Master.

655
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,160
Please be honest with me.

656
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,160
Did you know he was here?

657
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,350
Was it why you took me here?

658
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,920
Why did you do this?

659
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,190
Yes.

660
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,830
I took you to Suzhou because of that.

661
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,590
I don’t want to see you

662
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,070
weighed down day by day.

663
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,230
I knew you wanted to see him.

664
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,070
So here we are.

665
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,590
Have I done anything wrong?

666
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,640
Master.

667
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,920
Why didn’t you give me a heads-up?

668
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,040
Why did you make a decision without notice?

669
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,430
Tou

670
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,110
left Sword Manor in anger last time.

671
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,590
How is he willing to see me again?

672
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,950
Fengzi.

673
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,230
It breaks my heart

674
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,000
to see you miss a man

675
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,230
every day.

676
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,710
You love the man wholeheartedly.

677
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,760
Will you just give up?

678
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,800
But master,

679
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,760
During the engagement banquet,

680
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,920
Tou was humiliated in front of everyone

681
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
and left in despair.

682
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,040
Do you think

683
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,310
he will to listen to anything that I say?

684
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,760
I’m afraid he’ll only find me repulsive.

685
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,230
Why should I ask for
humiliation again and again?

686
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,920
Fengzi.

687
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,160
Listen to me.

688
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,680
After the engagement banquet,

689
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Shangguan Tou did resent Sword Manor.

690
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,070
But because of that,

691
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,430
Chong Xuezhi will never speak to him again.

692
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,640
This is your opportunity, isn’t it?

693
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,000
So what you need to do is

694
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,230
seize the opportunity.

695
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,880

that you can forgive me.

But back then,

776
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,710
I was young.

777
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,670
I thought

778
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,470
sleeping together

779
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,870
meant a promise.

I saw you meeting someone in secret.

I didn’t see clearly who that was,

820

but then the misunderstanding
between me and Xuezhi emerged.

I don’t have to hold things back anymore.

832
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,910
A few years ago,

833
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,840
I followed Feng Cheng’s order

834
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,710
to join Sword Manor.

835
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,150
My goal is to steal the manual of Nine Moves.

But you caught me

837

as the manual was within my reach.

838
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,120

a clever man like you

840
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,280
would uncover me sooner or later.

841
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,080
So I decided to kick you

842

out of Sword Manor.

843
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,800
At the time,

844
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,710
Fengzi’s love for you was the only thing
that I could use.

845
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,840
I drugged your wines

846

and let Lin Zongxing
see you sleeping together.

847

I was young.

848

I didn’t know what you were up to.

849
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,080
Yet you ruined my name and future

850
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,430
just because you were worried that
I might be a threat.

851
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,600
Compared to the Nine Moves,

852
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,190
that was nothing.

853
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,560
After getting kicked of Sword Manor,

854
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,120
I was poisoned,

855
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,520
assassinated.

856
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,600
You are behind all of those, right?

857
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,560
Yes.

858
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,870
I caused the misunderstanding

859
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,840
between you and Chong Xuezhi

You must have a reason, right?

863
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,520
Why did you do this?

864
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,150

865
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,190
Don’t blame me.

866
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Feng Cheng and I were once lovers.

867
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,320

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,150
Shangguan Tou.

870
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,840
I’ve come clean.

871
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,520
What do you want to do with me?

872
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,430
You make the decision.

873
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I’ve put

874
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,600
the past behind me.

875
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,390
Now that I’ve got your full disclosure,

876
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,360
I’ll forgive you.

877
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,230
But

878
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,670
I hope you can stop living as a jackal.

879
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,870
If you stay unrepentant

880
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,470
by continuing to aid Feng Cheng.

881
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,710
I’ll double the retaliation.

882
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,120
Mercilessly.

883
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,190
Leader Yuan.

884
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,470
You make your choice.

885
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,360
Feng She.

886
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:41,800
Go.
