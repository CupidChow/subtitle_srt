Merciful Buddha.

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,320
Have you come here

7
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,190
to the Enlightenment Temple

8
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,650
for practicing Buddhism,

9
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,870
or for making wishes?

10
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,110
Master,

11
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,190
we hear that people come here
to launch the sky lanterns.

12
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,630
We want to have a look.

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
Merciful Buddha.

14
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,440
Please follow me.

15
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,390
Please come in.

16
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,190
What else?

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,829
OK.

18
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,890
I’ll write that on.

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,670
This is a lucky draw.

20
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,880
Do you want to

21
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,190
ask about your marriage?

22
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,910
Master,

23
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
are they writing their wishes

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,829
on the paper?

25
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,160
Exactly.

26
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,720
The Enlightenment Temple is famous for

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320
helping dreams to come true.

28
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,440
Many people thus come here

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
to make wishes.

30
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,829
If you

31
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,520
have any wish to make,

32
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,080
write them on the sky lantern.

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,280
Please help yourselves.

Fengzi,

35
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,320
why do you bring me here?

36
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,320
Master,

37
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,520
this temple is called

38
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,280
the Enlightenment Temple.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,440
It is said that whoever make their wishes here

40
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,300
will have their dreams come true.

41
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,930
You want to cure my illness, don’t you?

42
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,550
Don’t bother.

43
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,720
This is mental illness.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
You won’t cure it.

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,190
Master.

46
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,079
You need to have faith in yourself.

47
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,140
God will answer your sincere prayer.

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,750
Master.

49
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,600
Don’t you hate me

50
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
even for a bit?

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,470
When you

52
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,490
first came to the Sword Manor,

53
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,330
I just lost my mother to an illness

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,160
At that time,

55
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,950
I was depressed all day long.

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,320
You told my father

57
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,810
that you could help me get over the pains.

58
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,880
Then my father let me take you as my master.

59
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
I said so

60
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,280
because I wanted to approach you

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,760
and get into the Manor.

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,390
But you did help me get over the pains.

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,550
You told me

64
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,320
that life

65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,810
was full of departure.

66
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,380
You asked me to think
from the deceased’s perspective.

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,930
That if my mother was still alive,

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,090
she would not want to see me crying.

69
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,110
Now you lost your loved one.

70
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,510
Do you think

71
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,240
he would like to see you crying?

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
He never cared about my feelings.

73
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,920
But I do.

74
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Master.

75
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,550
You’ve been taking care of me

76
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,210
ever since I was a little girl.

77
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,440
To me,

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,670
you are very important.

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,390
I don’t want you

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,360
to drown yourself in sorrow.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,510
I’ve grown up.

82
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,350
I can take care of you now.

83

And I’ll be someone you can count on.

84

89

You have a rest first,

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,700

I knew it.

96
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,950
You still care about

97
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,550
the Hall of Flames very much.

98
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,480
I have been

99

tell myself

100
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,670
not to care about the Hall of Flames.

101

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,200
at the end of the day,

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,390
it’s still

my top concern.

After all,

106
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,350
that’s where we grew up.

That’s our home.

In Dongdu,

109
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,270
I saw girls

110
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,920
writing their wishes on the lanterns,

111
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,760
so I made my wish too.

112
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,390
I hoped that I could find

113
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,520
the missing Nine Moves sooner.

114
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,350
I did find it anyway

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
though

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,130
it was not like what I had expected.

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,200
Of course.

We’ll come and take them tonight.

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,110
OK.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,670
Meeting the loved one
may not be the best decision.

126

may be filled with affection.

The Buddhist wisdom is unlimited,

but it can only help the pre-destined.

135

Master, what do you mean?

136

I’ll interpret your fortune.

140
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,470

That’s the worst draw for marriage.

145
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,470
Your heart is full of love.

146
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,350
But the one you want to love is far away.

147

is there any way to solve this?

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,550
Whose problem are you trying to solve,

153
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,400
yours or hers?

154
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,640
What she wants

155
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,200
is what I want.

Don’t lie to me, young man.

157
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,790
What you want is totally different from

158
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,230
what she wants.

159
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,280

162
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,790
If you’ve been scared

163
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,910
by the draw,

164
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,570
why don’t you try fortune telling by character?

“Deng”.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,880
The character comprises of “zhu” and “si”.

167
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,550
“Si”

168
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,880
is the government’s office.

169
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,710
The laws and regulations

170

are the standards for ruling.

171
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,300
You write this character because

172
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
you’re either missing someone
from the government

173

or worrying about some governmental affairs.

174

could you please

178
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,910
explain it at length?

179
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,590
Let go.

180
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,230
I have nothing in hand.

181
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,400
Master,

182
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,760
what should I let go of?

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,730
Your hands are empty, but your mind is not.

184
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,760
You feel,

185
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,840
and thus you move.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,910
Movement incurs obsession,
and obsession drives the truth away.

187
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,590
It’s all vain.

188
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,150
So you mean

189
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
I should let go

190
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,880
what’s on my mind?

191
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,230
Self-infliction is endless.

192
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,470
But when you stop, you’ll be delivered.

193
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,070
Your obsession has caused others’ obsession.

194
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,960
You can’t keep the past thoughts.

195
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,230
Nor the current ones.

196
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,710
Not even the future ones.

197

The tie has been broken.

198
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,650
You need to let it go,

199
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,810
wait and observe, before you can see it through.

200
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,550
Only then

201
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,470
will the people and things on your mind

202
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,400
be safe and sound.

203
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,640
You must have

204
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,200
suffered enough from waiting, right?

He’s got a point.

213
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,400
I’ve been waiting for long enough

214

Why did you privately collect weapons

and armors for rebellion?

I have never planned to rebel.

Innocent?

You told Leader Chong Xuezhi

and Chief Guardian Yuwen Muyuan
of the Hall of Flames

When they were exposed and imprisoned,

248
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,840
you pulled some strings to release them.

If you are determined to declare me guilty,

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It’s you?

352
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,760
What do you want?

353
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,520
I won’t hurt you anymore.

354
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,040
Don’t be scared.

355
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,310
Scared?

356
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,630
You helped Feng Cheng

357
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,640
to set the Hall of Flames up.

358
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,640
Now the Hall of Flames is shut down.

359
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
You must be happy now.

360
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
I didn’t see that coming.

361
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
I’m sorry.

362
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,230
Will you forgive me.

363
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,050
Yuan Shuangshuang,

364
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,370
you helped a villain to do evil.

365
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,350
My family is ruined, thanks to you!

366
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,290
What's done is done.

367
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,710
I won’t blame you further.

368
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,620
But now you want me to forgive you?

369
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,830
Never!

370
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,760
I know you won’t forgive me.

371
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,180
And Fengzi should not forgive me either.

372
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,690
And neither should he,

373
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,880
Shangguan Tou.

374
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,590
I’ve denigrated them.

375
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,350
Denigrate?

376
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,640
What do you mean?

377
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,590
There was nothing between

378
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,140
Fengzi and Shangguan Tou.

379
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,350
At that time,

380
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,470
I wanted to steal the Nine Moves

381
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,950
from the Sword Manor.

382
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,850
I thought Shangguan Tou had found out my agenda.

383
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,400
So I tried many ways

384
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,830
to eject him from the Manor.

385
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
I put some knockout drops in his wine

386
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
and lied to Mr. Lin

387
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,980
about his relationship with Fengzi.

388
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,680
I also tried to make mischief

389
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,410
between you and Shangguan Tou.

390
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,830
Did Shangguan Tou know about

391
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,000
what you had done?

392
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,760
He did.

393
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,070
He knew it was me.

394
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,350
I know

395
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,570
I can never make it up to you,
not even if I die.

396
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,470
What I wanted at that time

397
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,160
was Feng Cheng’s love.

398
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,350
So

399
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,070
I would do everything for him,

400
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,760
even if I needed to betray my principles.

401
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,920
But I really envy you.

402
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,830
There’s a man who would

403
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,560
do everything for you.

404
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,040
He even risked his life to save you

405
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,160
when in Huashan.

406
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,810
Who was the one that saved me

407
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,950
in Huashan?

408
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,190
Who else can that be?

409
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,920
Xuezhi.

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,880
Xuezhi.

411
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,120
The one who saved me from Feng Cheng

412
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,520
was Muyuan, right?

413
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,640
That man

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,190
was Shangguan Tou.

415
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,400
To save you,

416
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,280
he was beaten black and blue.

417
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,440
He even tried to killed himself

418
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,710
to exchange your life

419
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
with his.

420
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,950
I know my sins

421
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,160
are beyond redemption.

422
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,070
But telling you the truth

423
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,920
is a relief to me.

424
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,040
Chief Guardian,

425
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,850
please bring Xuezhi back home

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
and take good care of her.

427
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,940
Thank you, Master Shangguan.

428
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,920
Don’t worry.

429
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
I’m here with you.

430
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,070
I, Yuwen Muyuan,

431
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,560
swear to the ancestors of the Hall of Flames

432
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,310
with my life

433
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,920
that I will do my best

434
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,590
to keep Xuezhi safe

435
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,430
for the rest of my life,

436
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,020
even if I need to fight against Huashan Sect,

437
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,170
or even the whole martial arts world.

438
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,310
If I break my promise,

439
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,890
I’ll die a horrible death.

440
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,880
But from now on,

441
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,360
I hope I can protect you for the rest of your life

442
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,070
by another role.

443
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,350
May I?

444
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,280
The one I need to protect

445
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,070
is

446
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,000
you.

447
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,880
No worries.

448
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,070
Thank you.

449
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,230
Muyuan…

450
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,070
I know.

451
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,610
I know what you want to ask me about.

452
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,340
Yuan Shuangshuang was right.

453
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,430
Shangguan Tou was the one who saved you.

454
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,830
He left you with me

455
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,370
and asked me to take care of you.

456
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,520
I selfishly believed that

457
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,760
you’d forget him

458
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,430
as time went on

459
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,000
if I never told you the truth.

460
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,410
Then you’d fall in love with me.

461
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,920
I’m sorry.

462
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,900
I should have told you.

463
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,950
Muyuan,

464
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,680
I don’t want to let you down.

465
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,710
But I know clearly

466
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,910
that he is the only one

467
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,710
I love.

468
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,190
If I marry you when I still miss him

469
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,590
and feel guilty for him,

470
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,470
we’ll never be happy.

471
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,430
After I left him,

472
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,710
I’ve been lying to myself

473
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,110
that I don’t love him anymore,

474
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,640
that I’ve got over him,

475
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,920
and that

476
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,110
I won’t wait for him anymore.

477
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,430
I almost made it

478
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,190
until

479
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,680
I heard about

480
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,110
the whole story.

481
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,070
I can’t lie to myself anymore.

482
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,190
Tell me

483
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,260
when did you fall in love with him?

484
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,160
I don’t know.

485
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,590
But I would do

486
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,230
anything for him.

487
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,070
Even when we are apart now,

488
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,000
all his words

489
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,040
and actions

490
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,350
are just lingering in my mind.

491
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,760
I can feel clearly

492
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,880
the sorrow and my care for him.

493
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,350
Before today,

494
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,920
I thought he didn’t love me anymore.

495
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I thought he’d given up on me.

496
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,110
I tried to get over him.

497
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,880
But I tried so hard,

498
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,950
only to find that

499
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,880
I’d never get over him.

500
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,230
And now

501
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,160
I know he loves me,

502
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,230
that he hasn’t given up on me.

503
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,400
Do you know

504
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,760
I love you deeply as well?

505
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,500
But you shouldn’t have lied to me.

506
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,430
The bloodstains on his clothes

507
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,760
are like knives that keep stabbing my heart.

508
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,400
You shouldn’t have lied to me, Muyuan.

509
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,400
Of course.

510
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,230
You feel hurt

511
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,800
when he bleeds.

512
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,520
Then what about me?

513
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,350
Can’t you see

514
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,110
what I’ve done for you?

515
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,470
What exactly am I

516
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,070
to you?

517
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Muyuan,

518
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,350
I always treat you

519
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,800
as my family.

520
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,000
You are a most trusted brother.

521
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,830
You understand,

522
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,070
accompany

523
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,350
and support me.

524
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,520
If he didn’t show up in my life,

525
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,190
perhaps

526
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,740
I would have fallen in love with you some day.

527
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,920
But he did show up.

528
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,680
That’s our fate.

529
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,310
Muyuan,

530
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
I know

531
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,560
you’ve done a lot for me.

532
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,000
But the only one I love

533
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,680
is Shangguan Tou.

534
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,470
I see.

535
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,590
It’s your fate

536
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,520
to fall in love with him.

537
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,640
And it’s my fate

538
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,710
to lose you.

539
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,230
Even when you stay here,

540
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,670
your heart has long flown away.

541
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,280
Well,

542
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
go find him.

543
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,670
Sorry,

544
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,190
Muyuan.

545
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,190
Don’t be.

546
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,150
There’s nothing you should be sorry for.

547
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,710
I promised

548
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,000
to keep you safe.

549
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,840
But I failed.

550
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,929
I said I’d rebuild the Hall of Flames.

551
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,150
But I didn’t make it.

552
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,080
Then

553
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,760
I also failed

554
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,950
to give you a home.

555
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,320
Now I have

556
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
only one last wish.

557
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,910
I hope

558
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,910
you can live

559
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,650
a happy and peaceful life.

560
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,520
This horse is not as good as Paper though,

561
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
it can still bring you there safely.

562
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,840
Xuezhi,

563
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
if you get tired

564
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,470
someday,

565
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,040
or injured,

566
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,840
or bored,

567
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,230
come back to me.

568
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,360
Congratulations, Princess!

569
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,870
You’re pregnant.

570
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,190
You’re sure?

571
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,080
I’m sure.

572
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,430
Your Highness.

573
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,430
Please

574
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,200
take good care of yourself.

575
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,690
You can’t afford

576
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
any fright,

577
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,730
or the exhaustion from travel.

578
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,280
I’ll go

579
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,430
and prescribe for you

580
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,710
some herbs for miscarriage prevention.

581
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,630
Please take them

582
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,870
on time.

583
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,600
The Imperial Advisor colluded with the rebels

584
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,630
of the martial arts world

585
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,910
and illegally possessed weapons for rebellion.

586
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,280
He’s now imprisoned

587
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,430
under the charge of conspiracy.

588
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,230
His son,

589
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,000
wife, concubines and brothers

590
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,040
aged over 16

591
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,290
have all been sentenced to be hung.

592
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,360
His assets

593
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,690
have been confiscated.

594
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,630
Zheng,

595
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,880
why are you here?

596
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,430
Say that again.

597
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,150
The Imperial Advisor colluded with the rebels

598
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,550
of the martial arts world

599
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,150
and illegally possessed weapons for rebellion.

600
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,280
He’s now imprisoned

601
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,670
under the charge of conspiracy.

602
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,470
Rebellion?

603
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
My father has never connected
with the martial arts world.

604
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,050
How could he collude with them?

605
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,770
Have you heard anything from Tou?

606
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,520
Shangguan Tou’s whereabouts

607
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,430
are unknown.

608
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,360
The Imperial Guards

609
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,620
are searching for him.

610
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:46,950
Zheng,

611
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Imperial Advisor

612
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,630
has always been loyal
to His Majesty and the country.

613
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,520
Everyone knows about his righteousness.

614
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:52,950
Sir,

615
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,630
there must be secret behind this.

616
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,190
Please do a thorough investigation.

617
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,760
Yes.

618
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,470
Go.

619
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,710
Who’s trying to frame us?

620
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,280
Kill me first!

621
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,520
Zheng.

622
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,150
Zheng.

623
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,280
Calm down.

624
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,040
I promise you

625
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,380
I will figure this out.

626
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,910
Zheng.

627
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,220
Your Highness.

628
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,600
Tell me,

629
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,670
when will my father be executed?

630
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,700
[WANTED Shangguan Tou]

631
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,520
Master,

632
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,190
you’re already on the to-be-hung list.

633
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,150
The execution

634
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
will be in 15 days.

635
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,950
On my way back,

636
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,520
I saw the Imperial Guards
were searching the houses nearby.

637
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,320
I’m afraid

638
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,910
we’re not safe here.

639
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,330
We should leave at once.

640
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,000
I don’t want to hide anymore.

641
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Father is imprisoned for an unjust charge.

642
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,380
I must find a way to clear his name.

643
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,600
Master,

644
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,760
you need to keep yourself safe first

645
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,360
before you can clear Imperial Advisor’s name.

646
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,450
All of you, come out.

647
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,120
Go.

648
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,840
Come here.

649
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,600
Go.

650
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,320
Have you seen the man on the portrait?

651
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Have you seen the man on the portrait?

652
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,950
No.

653
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,420
We are surrounded.

654
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,040
Master,

655
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,280
I’ll go lead them to another way,

656
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,140
and you seize the chance to leave.

657
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,730
I’ll meet you in the forest in the east.

658
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,580
Go after him! Hurry up!

659
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,280
Stop!

660
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,390
Master Shangguan.

661
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,320
Don’t worry.

662
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,320
I am the guard of the crown prince.

663
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,390
His Highness sent us here

664
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,990
to escort you to a safe place.

665
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,840
Please.

666
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,680
Please, Master Shangguan.

667
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,230
Master.

668
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,040
Wuming.

669
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,840
Are you OK?

670
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,430
I’m fine.

671
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,390
How are you?

672
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,430
I’m fine.

673
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,830
It’s been a long time.

674
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:10,770
Your Highness.

675
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,120
-Good day, Your Highness.
- Make yourself at home.

676
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,670
Sit.

677
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,600
Shangguan Tou.

678
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,120
Now all the Imperial Guards in Dongdu
are looking for you.

679
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,600
Without my protection,

680
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,390
you should be

681
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,630
in prison now

682
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,620
just like your father.

683
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,590
Thank you for your help, Your Highness.

684
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,040
I’m wondering

685
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,630
why Your Highness…

686
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,800
I only met you twice before.

687
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,320
But it’s enough for me to admire
your talent and personality.

688
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,920
I always value the talented.

689
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,140
I don’t want you to be executed
for an unjust charge.

690
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,120
Besides,

691
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
Imperial Advisor

692
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,230
has assisted me in many ways.

693
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,080
I want to find out

694
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,280
the truth

695
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,040
of his rebellion.

696
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,570
Your Highness,

697
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,390
my father has always been loyal to His Majesty

698
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,320
and cares for the people very much.

699
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,740
Your Highness should not believe the rumor.

700
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,930
Are you saying that

701
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,150
Imperial Advisor has been wronged?

702
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,940
I haven’t got valid evidence yet,

703
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,950
but I swear to God that

704
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,120
my father has never colluded
with the martial artists,

705
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,050
let alone planning for rebellion.

706
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,800
But the Imperial Guards

707
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
did find the weapons and armors

708
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,850
illegally collected by the Hall of Flames

709
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,710
at the Imperial Advisor’s Mansion.
