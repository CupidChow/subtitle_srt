[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 23

4
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,440
Never mind, you can go ahead chatting.

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,970
This place does not suit me.

6
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,720
Feng She.

7
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,130
You haven’t met the fairies here.

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
How do you know this place doesn’t suit you?

9
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,600
I’m not interested.

10
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,800
She’s not a fairy,

11
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,270
but a rogue.

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
Tou.

13
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,160
Why are you together?

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,750
To poison you.

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,550
But Hongxiu,

16
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
the Winehouse of Fairyland is always

17
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,960
occupied by eminent guests.

18
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,270
Why do you have time today

19
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,880
to make fun of Feng She?

20
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,470
You tell me.

21
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,720
The Nine Moves?

22
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,050
Are you sure?

23
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,030
Yeah.

24
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,600
There was a pattern of five-petal lotus

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,470
on the dead body.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
It is the Nine Moves for sure.

27
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,520
Then,

28
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,550
she…

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,330
I heard what happened between you and Xuezhi.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,630
Well.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
There was quite a scene

32
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,470
on the engagement banquet.

33
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,360
It’s not surprising that you knew

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,470
since the whole world is talking about it.

35
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,270
I don’t care what others think.

36
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,000
I only believe what I’ve seen with my own eyes.

37
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,550
I know you are serious with Xuezhi.

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
So it’s better for you

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
to explain to her ASAP

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,110
I can’t explain it clearly by several words

41
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,570
and without any evidence.

42
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,320
Moreover,

43
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,000
she doesn’t want to see me now.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyway,

45
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,110
I should keep him here temporarily.

46
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,880
Then when Xuezhi comes here,

47
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,670
they would perhaps make up.

48
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,440
Okay, enough.

49
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,100
Let’s not talk about this now.

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,110
Now that you are here,

51
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,750
you can’t leave so soon.

52
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,600
You have to help me

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,110
make some progress in the investigation.

54
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,160
Just look at this.

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,520
My business here is in a slump.

56
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,110
Okay, I will.

57
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,440
I’ll help you definitely.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,480
Actually, I didn’t intend to

59
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,970
leave the Winehouse of Fairyland so soon.

60
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,210
What else did you come here for?

61
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,550
I doubt that

62
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,760
someone told Man Feiyue to

63
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,320
spread the flu

64
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,810
because they wanted to

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,830
cause trouble to the Hall and Xuezhi.

66
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,320
The reason I came here is to look into it.

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,200
Do you mean

68
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,830
there’s somebody else

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,440
behind the spread of the flu?

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,790
I got some evidence

71
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,320
by accident.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,230
I’ll specify it to you

73
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,690
after I find out the truth.

74
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,610
You have to be careful.

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,880
Hongxiu.

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,230
I need your help

77
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,640
to find out the truth.

78
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,880
You can be assured of that.

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,760
Her business is also my business.

80
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,220
I’ll definitely help you.

81
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
Over there.

82
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,390
That man died over there.

83
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
What’s his name?

84
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,440
Zhang Shan.

85
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,450
A disciple from Huashan Sect.

86
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,920
He left the sect years ago to stand on his own.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,880
Relying on his Huashan martial arts,

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,830
he was managing bodyguards for a rich merchant.

89
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,390
Anything unusual on the day he died?

90
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,320
No.

91
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,200
But he was dissolute

92
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,000
and came here regularly.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,610
Every time after he drank wine,

94
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,550
he would harass the girls.

95
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,000
So a lot of girls didn’t like him.

96
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,670
This is the list of all the guests here that day.

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,070
But the local government has checked them.

98
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,110
No one was found suspicious.

99
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,920
By the way,

100
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,790
the Leader of the Shark Sect

101
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,320
also died of the Nine Moves.

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
Did you know anything

103
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,720
about this?

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
Didn’t he die

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,830
because of Xuezhi?

106
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,880
It seems

107
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,670
this is more complicated than we expected.

108
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,540
[Divine Spirit Temple]

109
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,350
Hongxiu.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,950
What you are really doing here

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,440
is far more profitable than those outside.

112
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,670
Although I haven’t received any message that

113
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,510
Man Feiyue was colluding with anyone,

114
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,200
I know the Divine Spirit Temple

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,510
was ordered to kill people

116
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
and made money by this.

117
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,350
Perhaps,

118
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,720
we can find out something

119
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,870
from the previous information.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,230
Take your time here.

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,920
I’ll leave then.

122
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,320
Thank you.

123
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,700
[Devine Spirit Temple,
the third year of the reign of Emperor Jianping]

124
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,790
No clue at all?

125
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,640
Who was behind Man Feiyue?

126
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,090
Why are you sitting here all alone?

127
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,040
Are you tired because you spent a long time

128
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,159
in the sanctum?

129
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,670
Yeah.

130
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,720
I had no clue.

131
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,790
Don’t rush.

132
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,200
You can’t find out everything

133
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,230
in just one day.

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,230
Look at you. Your eyes are reddened.

135
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,550
I’ll have someone send a cup of tea.

136
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,350
Since when do you start to send tea

137
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,110
instead of wine?

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Wine?

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
I quit.

140
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,480
Nobody will be there

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,760
if I’m drunk.

142
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,350
Langya…

143
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
You don’t have to console me.

144
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,470
I know he’s gone.

145
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,790
Hongxiu.

146
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,240
Let’s go visit him someday.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,790
Actually, I have accepted that he’s gone.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,460
It’s just that sometimes,

149
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,760
I really can’t hold it back.

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,790
I think of him often.

151
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,910
I heard those guests

152
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,840
call you Mrs. Zhong.

153
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,000
Although I didn’t marry him officially,

154
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,110
in my mind,

155
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,100
He was already my husband.

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,590
And

157
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,350
he’ll be my only husband.

158
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,350
Tou.

159
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,440
Actually,

160
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,300
I have sent a letter to the Hall

161
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,640
and invited Xuezhi to come here.

162
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,460
Listen to me first.

163
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,230
I don’t care what happened between you.

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,550
I just hope that

165
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,440
you can clear the misunderstanding as quickly as possible.

166
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,790
I don’t want to see

167
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,520
you and her

168
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,320
end up like us,

169
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,240
still bearing regrets.

170
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,710
Honestly,

171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,550
Are you thinking about her?

172
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,910
You’ve been looking at the moon.

173
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
What are you thinking?

174
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,400
The person on moon,

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,760
Chang’e.

176
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Muyuan,

177
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,760
is it possible

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,640
for Chang’e

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,320
to see people on the earth?

180
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
Even if she can’t see others,

181
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
she can at least see Houyi.

182
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,640
Or,

183
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
she will feel lonely.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
So,

185
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,310
the one who can see and the one who can’t,

186
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,030
who is lonelier?

187
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,610
When she stole the medicine and went to moon,

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,670
she had made a decision.

189
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,320
If keeping doing something

190
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,760
is surely a mistake,

191
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,150
it’s better

192
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,320
to forget it.

193
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,230
Shangguan Tou.

194
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,470
I know Muyuan is right.

195
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,110
But why can't I make up my mind?

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,710
I said it was all over and clear between us.

197
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,910
Why do I still hope you can come to me?

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
We’ve been together for days and nights

199
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,110
and gone through so much.

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,350
Why do you still not want to

201
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,840
tell me your secrets?

202
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,200
Why do I think of you

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,710
no matter what I’m doing?

204
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,350

205
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,200
Will you think of me

206
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,880
when you can’t see me?

207
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,790
Qingmei.

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,530
Do you know where Fengzi is?

209
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,080
I’m not her maid.

210
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,840
I don’t know.

211
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,510
Please go find her yourself.

212
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,640
Master.

213
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,140
Are you looking for me?

214
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,640
I met Qingmei

215
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,670
when I passed by.

216
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,170
It seems that

217
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,900
he’s still not over the engagement banquet.

218
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,840
Are you okay?

219
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,350
No, not good.

220
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,230
After the banquet,

221
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,890
we’ve rarely seen each other.

222
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,150
He has been avoiding me intentionally.

223
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,960
I don’t know how to face him.

224

Let’s get some fresh air.

227
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,470
Fresh air?

228
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,550
Yeah.

229
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,960
Instead of staying here every day,

230
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,880
and being sad alone,

231
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,400
we should go out and get some fresh air.

235

Sir, wake up.

It’s daytime, and we’ll start our business now.

Yeah.

You can leave

244

Yeah.

So,

you have to pay for this yourself.

you really agree that I can go out with master?

to widen your gaze and learn something.

the infatuation you have

No.

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,430
So,

350
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,890
it has to be related to the government.

351
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,680
Feng She.

352
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,640
Are you sure?

353
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,800
Yeah.

354
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,880
People like you from rich families

355
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,280
naturally read a lot of book since childhood.

356
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,140
I grew up in Divine Spirit Temple,

357
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,820
and Man Feiyue never treated us as human.

358
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,070
In her eyes,

359
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
we were all tools to test the poison.

360
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,170
We had no chance to read and study.

361
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
But don’t underestimate me.

362
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,590
I know those characters for poison.

363
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,350
Five-poison powder.

364
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,710
Diabrosis plants.

365
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,680
And…

366
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,230
Enough.

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,190
Let’s go, master.

368
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,800
Thank you.

369
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,830
We can see

370
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,710
both the lobby and the yard

371
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,000
by sitting here.

372
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,110
We can take actions accordingly.

373
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,710
I wonder where Hongxiu is.

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,400
Hongxiu.

375
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,310
Show yourself!

376
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,560
I’m here to

377
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,640
propose to you, Hongxiu!

378
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,860
Show yourself right away!

379
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,350
I’m here to propose to you!

380
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,070
Who is barking outside

381
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,640
and annoying my guests?

382
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,920
-You’re here, my wife.
-Hongxiu.

383
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,590
You made me wait for you anxiously.

384
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,350
Mr. Qian.

385
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,560
You’re drunk in daytime?

386
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,710
Talking nonsense in my Winehouse!

387
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,920
I heard long before that Hongxiu is

388
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Who is your wife?

389
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
the most beautiful woman in Suzhou and Hangzhou.

390
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,640
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,710
Having seen her with my own eyes,

392
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,830
I have to say she really is beautiful.

393
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,430
If you come here to get wasted,

394
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,680
I’ll welcome you anytime.

395
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,800
If you come here to make a mess,

396
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
The beauties in the world

397
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,350
are not comparable to our Leader.

398
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Help me, Hongxiu.

399
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,230
Mr. Qian, what do you want?

400
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,430
Easy.

401
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,190
I just want to propose a marriage today.

402
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
“Door”.

403
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,560
“Of”.

404
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,040
What’s on this?

405
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,760
It says

406
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,160
Emei Sect used to

407
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,070
assign their spies

408
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,680
in every other sect

409
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,830
to collect intelligence and information.

410
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,110
That’s all?

411
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,290
I’m not surprised.

412
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,470
I knew it already.

413
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
You knew that?

414
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,000
How?

415
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,400
No, nothing.

416
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,520
I’m just saying.

417
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,680
Yeah.

418
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,920
You are so skilled

419
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,430
in bragging.

420
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,160
Bragging?

421
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,590
I’m telling you that

422
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,250
I knew it in the Hall of Flames.

423
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,350
Hall of Flames?

424
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,560
You know the spy in the Hall?

425
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,830
Of course

426
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,520
I do.

427
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,560
But I wouldn’t tell you

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,470
because you said I liked to brag.

429
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,190
Feng She.

430
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,830
Tell me who it is.

431
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,590
It’s really important to me.

432
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,710
If you tell me,

433
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,310
I’ll give you ten taels every month.

434
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,000
Ten taels?

435
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,240
Are you serious?

436
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,880
Yeah.

437
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,160
No.

438
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,800
I shouldn’t sell myself for ten taels.

439
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,760
I want more.

440
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,470
20 taels.

441
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,880
Okay.

442
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,800
I’ll tell you.

443
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,710
Hurry up.

444
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,280
The spy Emei sent to the Hall is…

445
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,340
Master Shangguan.

446
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,280
Please come with me.

447
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,210
Hongxiu has come across a trouble.

448
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,950
As long as you agree to marry me,

449
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,190
I’ll let her go.

450
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,950
Okay, okay.

451
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,070
I’ll step back

452
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
since I’ll listen to whatever my wife says.

453
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,420
How about this?

454
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,470
Give me a kiss.

455
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,140
-Bastard.
-I’ll let her go if you kiss me.

456
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,070
Kiss me hard.

457
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,070
Don’t lie to me.

458
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,760
On my lips.

459
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,590
Do you think this is hard enough?

460
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,000
Master Shangguan!

461
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,350
What a lifesaver!

462
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,680
It’s you.

463
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,590
I wonder

464
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,640
who the bastard is.

465
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,920
Do you have any idea who I am?

466
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,830
I’m Qian Mingyi, Leader of Sharp Knife School.

467
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,430
I suggest you watch your mouth.

468
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,520
The Winehouse of Fairyland is an elegant place,

469
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
and rude behavior is not welcome here.

470
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,350
I don’t care if you’re Qian Mingyi or Qian whatever.

471
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,640
Before I’m angry,

472
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,280
apologize to Miss Qiu right away.

473
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,690
Did you hear him?

474
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
He asked me to apologize.

475
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,310
Lad.

476
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,280
Are you new in this world?

477
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,110
You don’t even know Sharp Knife Sect?

478
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,190
Don’t say I bullied you.

479
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,040
I’m going to show you

480
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,370
what real power is like.

481
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,520
So,

482
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,430
you’re not going to apologize?

483
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,350
So what?

484
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,830
Miss Qiu.

485
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,110
Good.

486
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,160
Let’s go.

487
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,230
Hurry up.

488
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,800
Go!

489
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Go on, everyone.

490
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,050
Don’t feel disappointed.

491
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,310
ALL drinks are

492
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,350
on the house!

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,590
On the house!

494
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,430
We can’t find anything for today.

495
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,640
Let’s go back and have a rest.

496
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,100
We’ll come back tomorrow.

497
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,700
Since you’re here,

498
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,310
don’t leave.

499
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
Master Shangguan.

500
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,800
How are you?

501
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Xuezhi.

502
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,940
It’s so good to see you.

503
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,880
Since you’re here, stay a few days.

504
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,590
We can catch up. Follow me.

505
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,250
Don’t look at your beauty now.

506
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,490
The one beside her.

507
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,190
What do you mean?

508
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,110
20 taels.

509
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,110
I have a long-lost daughter.

510
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,800
She’s your cousin, Huan.

511
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,680
Huan?

512
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,460
Master Shangguan.

513
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,950
What do you want?

514
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,430
Nothing.

515
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,720
I just want to see you.

516
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,760
I thought you left hastily

517
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,160
for Sword Manor that day.

518
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,040
Xuezhi,

519
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,920
how have you been?

520
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,660
None of your business.

521
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,430
I said what I should say.

522
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,880
Why do you keep coming to me?

523
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Do you really mean

524
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,400
what you said?

525
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,520
Of course.

526
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,380
You preferred to believe Yuan Shuangshuang

527
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,590
instead of me.

528
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,430
If it wasn’t true,

529
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
why didn’t you explain for yourself

530
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,470
all these years?

531
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,210
Because of Miss Lin’s reputation.

532
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,590
Master Shangguan.

533
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,710
You are tolerant indeed.

534
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,310
Having been slandered like this,

535
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,680
you still think about her reputation.

536
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,790
So have you ever thought about your reputation

537
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,160
or mine?

538
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,800
For all these days,

539
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,560
I’ve been together with you.

540
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Have you ever thought about

541
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,310
how people laughed at me?

542
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Xuezhi.

543
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,360
I’m sorry.

544
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,280
It’s over.

545
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,450
Please leave me alone.

546
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,430
Feng She,

547
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,760
can you ask Liuli out for me?

548
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,920
Liuli?

549
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,610
What if she doesn’t want to see you?

550
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,710
I believe you know how to ask her out.

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,190
Yeah, I do.

552
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,430
I’m afraid…

553
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,830
Master…

554
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,740
Rest assured. You can count on me.

555
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,760
The desert here is really delicate.

556
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,620
The Leader will like this.

557
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,280
Hello,

558
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,400
how much is this?

559
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,230
20 coppers.

560
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,470
Okay.

561
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,960
Here you are.

562
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,350
Thank you.

563
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,000
Goodbye.

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,930
Come and take a look at my lanterns.

565
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,070
Lanterns.

566
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,830
Liuli.

567
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,970
Why are you here?

568
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
Feng She?

569
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,430
What’re you doing here?

570
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,560
I’m looking for you.

571
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Why?

572
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,830
The little beauty wants you.

573
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,950
The Leader? Why?

574
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,590
They’ve found the clues of the murderer.

575
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,520
They’re at the pavilion in the western suburb.

576
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,920
They asked me to tell you to go there.

577
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,520
Take this.

578
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,310
Leader.

579
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,920
Leader.

580
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,110
Where’s everyone?

581
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,160
Did I hear it wrong?

582
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,880
No, you didn’t.

583
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,040
But your Leader didn’t ask you out.

584
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,680
I did.

585
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,760
Master Shangguan?

586
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,000
I asked Feng She to do that.

587
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,000
Why?

588
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,690
Because I’m looking for someone.

589
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,400
Maybe you can help me.

590
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,310
Whom?

591
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,350
Her name is

592
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,000
Huan.

593
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,760
I’m sorry, Master Shangguan.

594
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,490
I don’t know anyone named Huan.

595
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
If there’s nothing else,

596
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
I’d like to leave.

597
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Huan’s mother asked me to find her daughter

598
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,350
before she died.

599
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
What did you say?

600
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,070
Tou.

601
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,760
In this life,

602
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,590
I’ve seen through everything in this world.

603
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,240
You don’t have to feel sorry for me.

604
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,590
There is only one thing

605
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,470
I can’t let go.

606
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,310
Can you help me?

607
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,520
Aunt.

608
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,350
You can ask me to do

609
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,770
anything you want.

610
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,160
I have a long-lost daughter.

611
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,950
She’s your cousin, Huan.

612
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,830
Huan?

613
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,710
She is three years younger than you.

614
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,830
At that year,

615
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,640
Emei Sect knew its strength was weaker

616
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,110
than other sects.

617
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,760
So

618
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
they assigned children to be spies

619
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,950
in different sects.

620
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,430
My poor child.

621
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,470
She was only 8

622
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,730
when she was sent away.

623
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,470
I don’t even know

624
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,430
what she looks like now.

625
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,400
Aunt.

626
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:28,400
Do you know where she was sent?

627
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,880
She was sent to the Hall of Flames.

628
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,650
The Hall of Flames?

629
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,680
It was me who has put her in great danger.

630
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,110
Tou.

631
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,160
After I die,

632
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,710
you’ll be the only relative

633
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,040
she has in this world.

634
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
You must find her

635
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,040
and take care of her for me.

636
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,070
Abbess Baiyun

637
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,640
has died.

638
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Stop crying.

639
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,970
If you cry again,

640
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,920
I'll kill your mother now.

641
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,160
You will never see her again.

642
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,560
Although you will go to the Hall,

643
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,560
you are still our disciple.

644
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What you need to do

645
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,000
is follow my orders at any time.

646
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,640
Aunt.

647
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,710
How can I find her?

648
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,430
When I knew she was going to be sent away,

649
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,640
I branded a fish-shaped mark

650
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,350
on her right arm.

651
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,590
Although I was young,

652
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,430
I remember my mother’s face

653
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,470
when she branded the mark on me.

654
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,520
She cried harder than I did.

655
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,710
I know she was forced.

656
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,080
I always thought that

657
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,950
as long as I was obedient,

658
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,310
I could reunite with my mother

659
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,000
when the mission was completed.

660
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,310
Completed?

661
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,980
When will it be completed?

662
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,590
Actually, I never thought about this problem.

663
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,310
I have been lying to myself

664
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,430
that the day will come.

665
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,590
Otherwise,

666
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,110
I really don't know how to live.

667
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,920
Since my aunt is gone now,

668
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,690
you don’t have to be constrained by Emei.

669
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,680
Huan, my aunt

670
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,510
asked me to take care of you before she died.

671
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,940
Why not go back to the Moon Valley with me?

672
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,430
Moon Valley?

673
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,180
[Winehouse of Fairyland]

674
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,560
Tou,

675
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,310
stop drinking alone.

676
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,680
What do you want me to do?

677
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,830
I brought you the one

678
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,880
you’ve been thinking about day and night

679
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,520
You have to take the chance this time.

680
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,980
Do not keep it to yourself.

681
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,000
Xuezhi.

682
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,000
Hongxiu,

683
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,930
what happened?

684
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,070
Do it.

685
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,280
Xuezhi.

686
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,830
Tou.

687
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,310
What's up?

688
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,220
The hearsay about Sword Manor

689
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,800
is not true.

690
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,160
You said this long ago.

691
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,710
Do you believe me?

692
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,950
I had countless opportunities to believe you.

693
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,760
In Dongdu.

694
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,310
In Xiangzhou.

695
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,700
In the Moon Valley.

696
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,880
As long as you told me,

697
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,470
I would believe you.

698
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,210
But you chose to conceal it from me.

699
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,070
You let me know the truth from others.

700
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,630
That's not the truth.

701
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,370
Is this important?

702
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,240
You’re standing in front of me now.

703
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,040
I can see your figure.

704
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,760
But I can't see through your heart.

705
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,909
After we experienced so much together,

706
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,080
you say you can't see through my heart.

707
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,760
It was my intention at first,

708
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,330
but unfortunately you were cold.

709
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,330
You listed so many high-sounding reasons

710
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,190
such as family and identity!

711
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,469
Can’t believe I believed you.

712
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,120
And then?

713
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,469
I found you did that

714
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,870
to conceal your relationship with Fengzi.

715
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,630
Yes.

716
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,909
I, a witch,

717
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,320
is not as good as the lady of the Sword Manor.

718
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,719
The son of Imperial Advisor

719
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,150
should match the daughter of a prince.

720
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,760
It’s all my fault that I even

721
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,120
wanted your love.

722
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,800
Xuezhi.

723
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,650
How can you think like this?

724
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,080
You doubt my love for you?

725
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,000
Where is your love?

726
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,600
Although I am not from a decent family,

727
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,860
I know to gain sincerity with sincerity.

728
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,480
I treated you with sincerity all the time.

729
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,870
But you

730
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,120
only concealed it and deceived me.

731
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,840
Was it so hard to tell me earlier?

732
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,710
Does my trust and understanding really

733
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,870
mean nothing to you?

734
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,730
I know you are noble and unsullied.

735
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,520
There is no need to explain to anyone.

736
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,000
I was so stupid to think that

737
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,040
I could be your exception.

738
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,000
I never care about

739
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,150
what other people think of me.

740
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,540
The only thing I care about

741
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,840
is how you think of me.

742
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,440
That’s why I couldn’t say it.

743
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,870
Never mind.

744
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,280
It’s over now.

745
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,530
It doesn't make much sense.

746
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,120
Now,

747
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,290
the Hall is in trouble and framed.

748
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,390
I really don't have the energy

749
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,320
to be one of the girls you use to make fun with.

750
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,870
In the future, without my burden,

751
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,950
you can regain

752
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,840
your unrestrained life.

753
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,040
But I

754
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,890
have to prioritize things about the Hall.

755
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,410
No matter how difficult the road ahead is,

756
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,810
I won't hold you back anymore.

757
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,080
We should

758
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,000
not disturb each other

759
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,240
and go our separate ways.

760
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,120
Xuezhi.

761
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,120
You have been staying with Tou for a long time.

762
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,090
Have you ever thought about

763
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,870
what you like about him?

764
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,280
His appearance,

765
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,230
his family, his talent

766
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,000
or his affluent Moon Valley?

767
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,840
Of course none of these.

768
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,000
I know you feel bad now,

769
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,320
but have you ever thought about

770
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,560
how he feels right now?

771
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,430
He has to

772
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,470
be blamed for

773
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,190
what he did not do.

774
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,390
And he must also see

775
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,080
his beloved one leave

776
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,610
under the eyes of everyone.

777
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,890
You didn't even give him a chance to explain.

778
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,280
Think about it.

779
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,910
When you were in Dongdu after leaving the Hall,

780
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,800
all people thought

781
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,230
you were a witch.

782
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,040
But had Tou

783
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,190
ever thought about you like that?

784
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,670
But we have

785
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,800
experienced so many things together.

786
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,920
He still concealed it from me

787
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,190
and lied to me.

788
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,560
Hongxiu.

789
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,430
If it were you,

790
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,300
would you believe him?

791
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,430
You say that

792
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,520
you have experienced so many things together.

793
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,950
What he did for you

794
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,430
is not enough to make you believe him once?

795
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,120
You are young

796
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,560
and it's the first time you’ve loved someone.

797
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,760
I can understand

798
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,560
you cannot accept it for a while.

799
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,230
But you have to remember that

800
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,630
you must not block the road between you two.

801
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,520
Even if he was wrong,

802
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
you should give him a chance to explain,

803
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,080
don’t you?

804
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,520
You are waiting for Xuezhi?

805
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,800
You don't have to worry about my business.

806
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,470
Not at all.

807
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,470
I just want to remind you

808
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,630
that some past

809
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,120
cannot be erased.

810
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,870
If you did it,

811
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,360
you have to take the consequences.

812
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,190
A girl like Xuezhi

813
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,910
can't hold you in her heart.

814
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,430
Chief Guardian.

815
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,360
Do you like Xuezhi?

816
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,710
Yes.

817
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,190
Yuwen Muyuan,

818
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I won't give Xuezhi to anyone.

819
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,120
It’s just that

820
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,470
she has misunderstood me now.

821
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,710
So,

822
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,800
if you like her,

823
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,630
please do everything you can to protect her.

824
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
You’re humorous.

825
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,170
I grew up with Xuezhi since childhood.

826
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,840
Why do I need you to tell me?

827
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,250
As long as I am here,

828
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,560
no one

829
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,800
can hurt Xuezhi.

830
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,800
Of course,

831
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,710
including you.

832
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,250
Chief Guardian.

833
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,670
You don’t want me to see her.

834
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,090
Are you afraid of losing to me?

835
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,230
You are wrong.

836
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,280
Love

837
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,080
is not a game,

838
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,490
and there should be no wins or losses.

839
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,710
I just think that

840
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,520
you are

841
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,320
out of her league.

842
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,710
I guess

843
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,760
it’s not decided by you.

844
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,560
You are right.

845
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
So,

846
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,870
please leave

847
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,670
her alone.

848
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,560
Muyuan.

849
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,850
Let me talk to him alone.

850
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,100
Wait for me over there.

851
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,840
OK.

852
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,600
You look lovely

853
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
in this.

854
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,910
Hongxiu said that

855
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,190
I should give you a chance.

856
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,710
So,

857
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,290
I’m here to hear your explanation.

858
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,760
Xuezhi.

859
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,150
It is my fault.

860
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,480
I shouldn't have concealed it from you.

861
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,840
But please believe me

862
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,330
the reason why I didn’t tell you

863
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,710
was that the matter

864
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,760
was also

865
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,520
a big blow for myself.

866
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,150
So I…

867
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,950
Chong Xuezhi.

868
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,040
You are the Leader of the hall, Chong Xuezhi?

869
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,310
The magistrate of Suzhou

870
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,180
would like to see you at the court.

871
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,420
[Government Office in Suzhou]

872
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,670
Chong Xuezhi.

873
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,840
Tell me.

874
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,760
Why did you kill a disciple of Huashan?

875
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,810
Your honor.

876
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,280
I didn't kill them.

877
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,950
There is no evidence to indicate

878
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,280
the Huashan disciple was killed by me.

879
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,680
Why did you convict me as soon as I came here?

880
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,190
Nonsense.

881
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,910
You just said,

882
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,190
the Nine Moves was created by your father.

883
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,040
It is solely owned by the Hall of Flames.

884
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,040
If you didn’t do it,

885
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,910
who else could it be?

886
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,840
Please check.

887
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
The Nine Moves of Lotus God

888
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,430
does belong to the Hall.

889
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
But it was stolen long ago.

890
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,150
I'm afraid I'm not the only one

891
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,950
who practices it.

892
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,190
Moreover, when the murder happened,

893
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,520
I was in the Hall.

894
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,470
How could I kill him in Winehouse of Fairyland?
