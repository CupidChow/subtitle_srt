And The Winner is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 13

4
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,470
You still want to protect
that girl whose father killed your father.

5
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,040
Your deceased father would be ashamed of you.

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,520
Yupan.

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,810
I’m so incompetent.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,480
I can’t even avenge your death.

9
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,720
Dad.

10
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
Did you also think I’m wrong?

11
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,480
If a revenge stands for filial piety

12
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,380
[Chong Ye, Leader of the Hall of Flames]
[Yuwen Yupan]

13
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,960
and the protection of the Hall stands for loyalty,

14
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,960
should I choose filial piety

15
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,580
[Yuwen Yupan]

16
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,000
or loyalty?

17
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,080
Dad.

18
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,080
Tell me.

19
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
What should I do?

20
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Muyuan.

21
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,880
Muyuan.

22
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,780
Why are you dodging me?

23
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,320
I’m not.

24
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,920
Muyuan.

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,360
Even you

26
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,760
are leaving me now?

27
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,120
You are overthinking.

28
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
I’m not.

29
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,440
Muyuan.

30
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,560
Are you disappointed in me

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
just like others?

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Gugu’s death.

33
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,000
Haitang’s death.

34
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,829
Zhusha’s injury.

35
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,530
The manual’s being burnt.

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,260
These are all caused by me.

37
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
No one in this Hall

38
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,360
supports me now.

39
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
I know…

40
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,159
I know I’m useless.

41
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,480
Elder Yuwen was right.

42
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,640
I’m not qualified to be

43
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,360
the Leader of the Hall at all.

44
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,159
So…

45
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,640
So, I’ve made up my mind.

46
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,080
I would like to

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
offer my position to you.

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,280
Muyuan.

49
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,760
Can you promise me that

50
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,060
you’ll guard this Hall for me?

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
No.

52
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,040
The reason you offer me that

53
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,570
isn’t that you want to step aside
for better choices.

54
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
It’s that you’re afraid,

55
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
cowardly,

56
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,770
and you want to run away.

57
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,780
But you have to remember that,

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,720
in this world,

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,530
you can’t just run away from

60
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,600
some things

61
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,159
just because you want to.

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,080
Whether you’re willing to or not,

63
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,490
you have to shoulder the responsibility.

64
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,159
The Hall of Flames

65
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
is your responsibility.

66
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
The Hall of Flames

67
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,760
is also your fate.

68
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,450
Do you understand that?

69
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,320
I…

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
I’m sorry, Muyuan.

71
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,130
You don’t need to apologize again.

72
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,120
The Hall does not need a Leader

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
who keeps apologizing for doing something wrong.

74
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,600
It needs a responsible Leader

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,050
who is ready to fight together with them anytime.

76
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,570
Do you know that?

77
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,560
Ready to fight together with them anytime?

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
If you want to restore

79
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
the prestige of the Hall,

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
you can’t have someone else to replace you.

81
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,690
You have to become brave

82
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
and grow up.

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
You have to let the whole Hall

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
or even the whole world know

85
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
no one

86
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,280
is more qualified than you.

87
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,570
Don’t be afraid.

88
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I’m here.

89
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,740
[Chong Ye, Leader of the Hall of Flames]
[Yuwen Yupan]

90
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,450
What’re you doing here?

91
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,450
Now that you’ve chose to assist Chong Xuezhi,

92
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,320
why didn’t you tell her

93
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,080
I’m the traitor

94
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
who’s been going against her?

95
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,090
I’ll make an announcement that

96
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,690
what the Young Master went through

97
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,549
was all done by Yu Wan.

98
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,600
There’s no one else.

99
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,720
Did you think

100
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
I would be grateful for that?

101
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
I don’t want your gratefulness.

102
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,840
I just hope

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
you can let go

104
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
all the hatred in your heart.

105
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,080
Your father,

106
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
my son, was killed by Chong Ye.

107
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,800
How dare you tell me to
let go of all the hatred?

108
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,060
So, should we continue

109
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
the endless fight?

110
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,580
How can you tell you

111
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
let go?

112
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Grandpa,

113
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,360
I know

114
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360
you couldn’t let go of

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,400
my father’s death.

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,560
So did I.

117
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
But you know that

118
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,040
the Young Master was young at that time.

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
She had no idea of what had happened.

120
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
She’s innocent.

121
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
I just hope that

122
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,940
you wouldn’t hurt her.

123
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,000
If anything happens to her,

124
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
I will not

125
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,640
stay in the Hall anymore.

126
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
How could you go this far

127
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,040
for her?

128
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
I know that

129
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,080
you want me

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,840
to lead the Hall.

131
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
But I’m sorry

132
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,400
I’ve failed you.

133
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,760
I have no ambition.

134
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,440
Nor do I want to become a hero.

135
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,960
When Chong Ye went astray,

136
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,440
someone told your father

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,280
to inherit the position.

138
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,680
He wouldn’t do it.

139
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,520
You…

140
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,200
You have so much in common.

141
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,640
Muyuan.

142
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,960
I’m old.

143
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,360
I have lost my only son.

144
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,600
I don’t want to

145
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
lose my only grandson too.

146
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
You can rest assured.

147
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,040
You’ll never lose me.

148
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,900
Master Shangguan.

149
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,660
Abbess Baiyun is waiting for you.

150
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,980
[Emei]

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,080
Please stay.

152
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
Abbess Baiyun only wants to see

153
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Master Shangguan alone.

154
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,960
Tou.

155
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,920
Tou.

156
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
Your eyes

157
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,760
resemble your mothers’.

158
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,760
You knew my mother?

159
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
Your biological mother

160
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,640
is Bailu.

161
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,700
She’s also my biological sister.

162
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
Do you mean

163
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,560
my existing mother

164
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,520
is not my biological mother?

165
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,800
Tou.

166
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,060
For the past few years,

167
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,080
I’ve been hesitating about

168
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,000
if I should tell you the truth.

169
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,120
I didn’t know if

170
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,800
you could take it.

171
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,360
Now,

172
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,120
my disease is getting worse.

173
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,920
I’m afraid I have little time left.

174
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,120
I know

175
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,800
I’ll have no chance to tell you

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
if I don’t tell you now.

177
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Tou.

178
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
Come with me.

179
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
You can leave now.

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,640
Yes.

181
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,760
This is where

182
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,280
your mother and I used to live.

183
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
At that time,

184
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,280
we were new to this world.

185
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,960
We went to the Emei School

186
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,240
and studied hard,

187
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,240
hoping we would

188
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,800
become heroines in this world.

189
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,890
Your mother was smart and persistent.

190
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
No matter how hard the martial arts are,

191
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,640
she wouldn’t give up.

192
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,680
I thought

193
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,360
she would overcome every difficulty

194
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,560
in this world.

195
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
But I hadn’t expected

196
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
love

197
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,320
was her inexorable doom.

198
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,360
One year,

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,680
we left the school

200
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,240
and met an elegant master.

201
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,400
It was your father,

202
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,680
Shangguan Xingzhou.

203
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,920
He was

204
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
young and handsome.

205
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,760
You mother was bright and brave.

206
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,050
They fell in love

207
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,600
immediately.

208
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,760
It’s after that

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,480
we began to realize he’s the
new officer for state affairs.

210
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,940
What’s more unexpected is

211
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,440
he had already…

212
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
What?

213
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,020
… been married and had a daughter.

214
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,690
His wife is your foster mother,

215
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,800
the only daughter of the Great General.

216
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,960
Your father was

217
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,960
young

218
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,480
and ambitious.

219
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,480
He’s extremely loyal to the court.

220
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,120
Marrying the daughter of the Great General

221
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
is for political purpose.

222
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,800
To meet you

223
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,480
is the happiest thing in my life.

224
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,240
I don’t want my baby to be fatherless.

225
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,330
What are you talking about?

226
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,600
Baby?

227
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Our baby?

228
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
We have a baby!

229
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,040
What shall we do now?

230
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Shangguan Xingzhou.

231
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,000
I knew everything

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,730
between you and that mistress.

233
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,360
If I told my father about this,

234
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,170
do you think you could still be in your postition?

235
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,720
She must die.

236
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,369
What’re you doing?

237
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,099
Sister, you leave.

238
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,760
Why’s there so much blood?

239
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Bailu.

240
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,260
What’re we going to do?

241
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Don’t be afraid.

242
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,920
It’s going to be okay.

243
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,440
Bailu.

244
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
Promise me.

245
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,360
Save my baby first.

246
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,400
No.

247
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,440
Hurry up.

248
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,880
Go.

249
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,160
Deep breath.

250
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
Bailu, deep breath.

251
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,010
He’s all bright and crystal clear.

252
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,040
Let’s call him Shangguan Tou.
(Tou means crystal clear in Chinese. )

253
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,680
Okay.

254
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,280
Shangguan Tou.

255
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,880
Remember

256
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,760
to tell him

257
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,640
about me

258
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,280
after he grows up.

259
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,040
Okay, I will.

260
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,080
I will, Sister

261
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,480
Tou.

262
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,880
Sister!

263
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,940
Bright and crystal clear.

264
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,930
So, my name was given

265
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
by my biological mother.

266
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,600
The moment she died,

267
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,620
I really wanted to kill Shangguan Xingzhou.

268
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,940
Hadn’t it been for his aspiration for power,

269
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,320
your mother wouldn’t have been treated like that

270
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,120
and died.

271
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,720
But he came

272
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
before I went to find him.

273
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,520
Lu.

274
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,040
Lu.

275
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
What’s wrong, Lu?

276
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,080
Open your eyes and look at me.

277
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,480
I’m here, Lu.

278
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,880
My baby.

279
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,680
My baby.

280
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,200
Let me take a look.

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
Shangguan Xingzhou.

282
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,810
You don’t deserve to be his father.

283
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,360
It’s you who killed my sister.

284
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,280
Lu.

285
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Our baby, look at him.

286
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,840
He’s so gorgeous,

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,460
bright and crystal clear.

288
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,120
He resembles you a lot.

289
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,000
Lu.

290
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,840
Lu.

291
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,080
How can I

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
pay you back this life?

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,680
Your mother’s smiling face

294
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,760
always appears in my head.

295
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,760
She likes to smile.

296
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,920
She’s so pure.

297
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,480
But

298
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,560
all beautiful things,

299
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,120
are like flowers.

300
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,090
No matter how beautifully they bloom,

301
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,240
they’ll wither and fall.

302
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
She had been in love with

303
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,740
Shangguan Xingzhou before she died.

304
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,240
She’s afraid I would hurt him,

305
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
and asked me not to blame him.

306
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,520
Your mother was the silliest girl in the world.

307
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,200
Sometimes,

308
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,040
being silly

309
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
is just like

310
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,000
being infatuated.

311
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,660
I grew up in the Imperial Advisor’s mansion.

312
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,200
I had nothing to worry about.

313
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,850
I went to school with other rich children.

314
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,010
In others’ opinion,

315
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,720
I’m the son of Imperial Advisor,

316
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,570
and grandson of the Great General.

317
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,720
I had all the love from people.

318
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,760
But in fact,

319
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
it’s not like this.

320
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,080
My foster mother did not like me.

321
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
She was mean to me all the time,

322
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,370
making it difficult for me
no matter what.

323
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,760
No matter how obedient I was,

324
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,570
I couldn’t live up to her expectation.

325
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Peirong.

326
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,800
Can’t you be kind to Tou?

327
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
Shangguan Xingzhou,

328
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,800
don’t ask too much.

329
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,480
I allowed him to live here.

330
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,560
He has lived an extravagant life.
There are even servants.

331
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,890
What do you want from me?

332
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,840
Should I pretend to be a good mother

333
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,000
and care about him?

334
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,480
Peirong.

335
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,360
He’s just a kid.

336
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,320
We shouldn’t extend our resentment

337
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,000
to next generation.

338
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
He’s your son.

339
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Don’t be worried.
I won’t hurt him.

340
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
But don’t expect that

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,920
he can get more from me.

342
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,900
[wan yan(jade)]

343
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
Do you know what ‘gem’ means?

344
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,520
Yes.

345
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,480
It means fine jade.

346
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,240
There is a saying from Travel Faraway· Song of Chu.

347
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,320
It says “Take in drips around a water fall,

348
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,520
and keep the essence of a gem”.

349

Gem is used as a metaphor for a gentleman’s virtue.

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,840
You’re so young,

351
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,000
but you already knew virtues of a gentleman.

352
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,240
You’ll definitely become an elite

353
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,720
when you grow up.

354

Tou.

355
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Are you willing to learn martial arts?

356
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,280
I am

357
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,610
as long as you’re happy.

358
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,320
Tou.

359
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,120
I just hope that

360
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
you can be safe.

361
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,920
After that,

362
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,960
my father sent me to
the Sword Manor to learn martial arts.

363
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
At first,

364
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
he visited me occasionally.

365
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,560
But later,

366
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,880
he rarely showed up.

367
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I thought that

368
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,800
he was afraid he would disturb me.

369
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,000
I thought

370
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,320
if I can work harder

371
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,000
and put more efforts into study,

372
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,850
my father would come back to see me.

373
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,240
But he never showed up again

374
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,920
So,

375
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,960
he sent me away

376
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,730
because he feared my foster mother would be unhappy.

377
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,800
Tou.

378
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,130

379
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,040
these years.

380
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,440
Before that,

381
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,280
I didn’t know

382
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,600
why a child and mother

383
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,140
can be so happy and harmonious

384
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,880

385
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,280
But I couldn’t.

386
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,000
It’s because I’m not her biological child.

387
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,040
She wouldn’t let me stay where I shouldn’t.

I’m satisfied that I can

meet you and tell you

394

Wait a minute.

402

It’s bad to take medicine
when you stomach is empty.

It’s said to enable anyone who ate it
to be immune to all kinds of poison.

I could see this coming.

524
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Did you know you’ll die today?

525
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,780
[Zhaoxue Tower]

526
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,640
Muyuan.

527
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,000
I’m looking for you.

528
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,960
Well.

529
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,360
Me too.

530
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Go ahead first.

531
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,680
I’ve identified the traitor

532
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,860
who wanted to hurt you before.

533
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,360
It’s Yu Wan.

534
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,280
How so?

535
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,960
I don’t know about the details.

536
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,920
But he knew his deeds were found out,

537
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,250
and he has left the Hall.

538
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
So I’m planning to

539
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,040
take him back by myself.

540
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
Never mind. Let him leave.

541
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,120
Now that he’s gone,

542
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,280
and I’m fine,

543
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
I don’t want to spend too much time

544
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
on him.

545
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,240
After all,

546
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,460
he’s a subordinate of Elder in Chief.

547
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
I hope he could correct his actions

548
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,720
and wouldn’t do this in the future.

549
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,780
Or else, he wouldn’t get away with it.

550
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
You’re decisive now,

551
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
very different from before.

552
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,800
I know.

553
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,880
Actually,

554
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,840
there is a long way to go

555
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,580
before I could be a qualified master.

556
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,200
But,

557
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,640
I have made up my mind.

558
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,660
I’m going to practice my martial arts in seclusion.

559
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,210
Practice your martial arts in seclusion?

560
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,820
Elder Yuwen was right.

561
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,160
I have no qualification

562
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,240
to be the Leader of the Hall.

563
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,000
Young Master.

564
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,240
Although he is

565
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,960
strict with you,

566
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,640
he…

567
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,560
Muyuan.

568
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,680
Listen to me.

569
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,120
The fact that I’m not qualified
to be the Master of the Hall now

570
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,400
doesn’t mean I won’t be in the future.

571
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,680
You’re right.

572
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
I shouldn’t avoid it.

573
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,340
Since revitalizing the Hall is my responsibility,

574
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,680
I should be equipped with

575
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,800
such abilities.

576
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
When I was little,

577
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,080
my father spoiled me.

578
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,000
Now he’s gone.

579
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,040
You can protect me

580
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
and look after me.

581
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,960
Because of your love,

582
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,920
I couldn’t focus

583
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,890
whenever I have a practice.

584
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,240
I can’t always

585
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
see myself as a little girl anymore.

586
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
I can’t always

587
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,810
hide behind your back forever.

588
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,880
Since

589
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,080
I can’t

590
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
change people’s attitude towards me,

591
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,200
and I can’t

592
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,890
change the whole world,

593
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,320
the only thing I can do

594
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,000
is to change myself

595
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,560
and make myself stronger,

596
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,360
Young Master.

597
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,040
I’m so happy to

598
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,160
see you like this.

599
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,960
But,

600
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,600
you just came back.

601
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,000
The whole Hall…

602
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,680
Muyuan.

603
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,680
I’ve made up my mind.

604
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,240
I want to practice in seclusion.

605
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
So,

606
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,040
during my seclusion,

607
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,520
the responsibility of protecting the Hall

608
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,600
lies on you now.

609
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,120
I’m …

610
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
still you father, right?

611
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,440
Tou.

612
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,010
As your biological father,

613
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,520
I haven’t expected you

614
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,520
to forgive me.

615
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,680
But it hadn’t occurred to me that

616
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,720
the meeting

617
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
between us

618
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,240
would be so

619
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,920
unbearable

620
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,320
like this.

621
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,280
I know

622
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,920
I wouldn’t have a

623
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,650
happy ending this life.

624
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,640
But you

625
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,760
have to look after yourself in the world.

626
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,120
Your hypocrisy

627
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,720
only matches with your heartlessness.

628
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
To me,

629
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,120
you’re just a biological father

630
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,000
who gave me life

631
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,120
but not reliance.

632
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
You offered me a house

633
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,130
but you couldn’t give me a home.

634
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,400
Why didn’t you just

635
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,440
let me grow like an orphan?

636
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,760
You treated me like

637
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,480
an underdog without dignity,

638
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,760
and left me at Sword Manor.

639
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,800
I could only live like I had a happy life,

640
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,320
and pretend that

641
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,520
I was a playboy.

642
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,440
I allow all kinds slander on me.

643
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,840
When I was poisoned,

644
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,160
I was like a wingless bird.

645
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,520
I was helpless.

646
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,000
I was struggling.

647
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,640
Did you ever imagine

648
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,260
the helplessness and desperation I had
when I fell into the abyss.

649
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
Where were you

650
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,880
when I felt miserable

651
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,200
about this world,

652
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,440
and wanted to die?
