00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 41

4
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,940
I went out to get you some herbs today.

5
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
The doctor said

6
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,360
you need to take this decoction consecutively.

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
So I bought ten doses,

8
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,940
plus some sweetmeats.

9
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
I know you don’t like bitterness.

10
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,450
Eat some sweetmeats

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,840
after taking the decoction,

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
and the bitterness will disappear.

13
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,320
Qingmei,

14
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,570
where did you get this amount of money?

15
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
I went downtown today

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,640
and happened to see a vacancy.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,720
So I gave it a go.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,650
That’s how I made the money.

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
What’s your job now?

20
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Don’t you worry.

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
I’ll prepare the decoction for you.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,760
Qingmei,

23
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,840
I have a bracelet.

24
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
I find it useless with me.

25
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,079
Maybe you can pawn it.

26
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,540
But…isn’t the bracelet a gift from your father?

27
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,010
Why do we need to pawn it?

28
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,079
We are not that desperate for money.

29
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,840
Qingmei,

30
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
we are living

31
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,160
a different life now.

32
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,490
We need to think before we spend every copper.

33
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,720
If you pawn the bracelet,

34
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,920
you won’t need to work that hard, right?

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
What do you mean?

36
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,100
You think I’m not able to support you?

37
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,920
Or do you think I got the money

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,360
from robbery?

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
I…

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,720
That’s not what I mean.

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,480
I don’t want you to toil.

42
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,160
Then what do you mean?

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,620
You start to think that

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,160
I am too incompetent

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,420
to support you, right?

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,480
You are looking down on me

47
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,140
just like your father.

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
You regret marrying me, don’t you?

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,130
If you marry Shangguan Tou,

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,360
you would not be living

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
a miserable life here with me,

52
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,280
suffering from all the nuisances, right?

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,080
Qingmei,

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,850
what are you talking about?

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,400
I never regret marrying you

56
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,860
since I made the decision.

57
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,280
Never regret?

58
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,500
You are the young hostess of the Sword Manor,

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,400
the most respected lady
in the martial arts world.

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
You’ve been living an extravagant life

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
and well attended to wherever you go.

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,460
Look at you now.

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,090
It took only a few days with me
before you fell ill.

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,140
You worried about the herbs I bought for you,

65
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,130
and offered to pawn your bracelet.

66
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,980
You are just insulting me on purpose.

67
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,400
No.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
No?

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,930
That’s not true.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes, you are!

71
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,300
No more decoction!

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,240
Qingmei,

73
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
don’t be angry.

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
You’ve misunderstood me.

75
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
I know

76
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,900
you’ve done all these for my own good.

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,960
I just don’t want you to push yourself too hard.

78
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
But

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
now we don’t have

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,040
any source of income.

81
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,640
It’s not going to work

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
if you need to practice marital arts

83
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
and work at the same time.

84
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
You know what?

85
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,080
If you can go back

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,410
and apologize to my father,

87
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,080
he will forgive us for sure

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,640
given your relationship with him in years.

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,320
I won’t apologize to him.

90
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,250
Why should I apologize
when I’ve done nothing wrong?

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
I’ve been treating him with all my heart,

92
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,170
but look what I’ve got from him.

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,760
I am nothing but his stepping stone.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,320
How stupid I have been!

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,850
But now I’ve come to know

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
that I can only rely myself

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
I will find a way to make money.

98
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Don’t you worry about that.

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,659
As for the Sword Manor,

100
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,420
I will never set foot in that place again!

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,720
No one believes in me!

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,780
Nobody believes in me!

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,520
Why don’t you believe in me?

104
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,680
No one will be able to laugh at me!

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,580
No one can look down on me anymore!

106
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,280
I will succeed one day!

107
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,400
Lin Zongxing,

108
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
Shangguan Tou.

109
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,320
Just wait and see!

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,640
Mr. Xia,

111
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
if you work for me,

112
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
I will not only reward you
with unimaginable wealth and glory,

113
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,890
but also help you

114
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,240
reach the top state of the Nine Moves.

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
That is, the ninth move

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
of this invincible martial arts skill.

117
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,000
What do you think

118
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,600
about this deal?

119
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Leader,

120
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,400
Ms. Lin…

121
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Don’t bother!

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,330
She chose to marry that man.

123
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
And she chose that path.

124
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,280
No one else should be blamed.

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,200
Then I'm leaving now.

126
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,420
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

127
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,780
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,360
Mr. Xia,

129
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,360
His Highness has been waiting for you
for some time.

130
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,220
Please come in.

131
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,240
Mr. Xia,

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,520
those who suit their actions to the times
are wise.

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,720
And you are a wise man.

134
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,770
You must know

135
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
what to choose.

136
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,540
Your Highness, actually,

137
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
I’m here to pay the 20 taels back

138
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
to Chief Guardian Muyuan.

139
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,200
20 taels?

140
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
That’s nothing.

141
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
When we give out money,

142
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
we never need people to pay back.

143
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,040
Also, I’ve told you

144
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
that you and I

145
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,140
would be good friends.

146
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,500
20 taels is a piece of cake.

147
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I can even give you hundreds,

148
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,210
or even tens of hundreds of taels for free.

149
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,490
Apart from this,

150
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
I will also

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,880
help you master

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
the Nine Moves.

153
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,210
Servant.

154
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,620
Your Highness.

155
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,000
Leave.

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,610
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,340
This is the Kylin Pill.

158
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
It comes from another nation.

159
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,920
Take it,

160
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,400
and your inner power will be boosted up.

161
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,240
It’ll help you

162
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,420
breakthrough and master the ninth move.

163
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,690
Are you really leaving?

164
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,480
Herbal Medicine Master,

165
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,740
please take good care of the Moon Valley.

166
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,880
Don’t worry, miss.

167
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
I will

168
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
even if you don’t ask me.

169
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,320
Mr. Lin.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,920
Mr. Lin.

171
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
I’m back.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,680
Wuming,

173
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,120
where have you been all this time?

174
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,180
I thought you were…

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,320
The other day when I was there
to rescue my master,

176
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,200
I was set up by Feng Mo

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,440
down the cliff.

178
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,760
Luckily, I was saved by an old couple.

179
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Are you injured?

180
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Nothing serious.

181
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,700
It’s just that my inner power
has been compromised.

182
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,320
I think

183
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,920
I should cure you first.

184
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,280
Don’t.

185
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,560
You have not recovered yet.

186
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,440
Leave it to me.

187
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,300
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

188
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,400
By the way,

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
where are you

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,970
heading for?

191
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,040
We are going to the Winehouse of Fairyland.

192
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
Uncle,

193
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,060
please cure Wuming first.

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,640
After that,

195
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,920
come and join me at the Winehouse of Fairyland.

196
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,440
Hongxiu is there.

197
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,760
I’ll be fine.

198
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,680
OK.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Be careful.

200
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Rest assured.

201
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,540
[Winehouse of Fairyland]

202
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Who are you?

203
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,500
[Winehouse of Fairyland]

204
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,160
Xuezhi,

205
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,600
it’s wonderful

206
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
to see you here safe and sound.

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,760
You knew I’d come?

208
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,120
I knew you’d come,

209
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,560
and I know why you come.

210
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,680
Let me

211
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,200
take you to a place.

212
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
I don’t know why

213
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,970
but when I see you today,

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,250
I just want to have a drink with you.

215
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,120
Lord Lu goes against the popular will

216
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,180
and thus has triggered public wrath.

217
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,410
It is our common wish

218
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,920
to overthrow him.

219
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,480
Us?

220
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Hongxiu,

221
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,960
is it snowing outside?

222
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
That’s not snow.

223
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
They’re petals.

224
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,120
It is my great fortune

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,120
to meet Miss Chong.

226
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
You are skilled at this.

227
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,960
You must

228
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,420
have a lot of experiences,

229
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,400
leaving loads of girls in sorrow

230
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,650
for not being able to win your love.

231
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,000
Miss Chong,

232
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
you are flattering me.

233
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Isn’t it true?

234
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
If I am indeed

235
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,800
the kind of person that

236
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
you think I am,

237
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,960
will you still

238
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,920
spend time with me?

239
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Then are you?

240
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,570
I don’t believe you.

241
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Tou.

242
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
Tou.

243
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,760
I’ve recognized your figure.

244
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
Why are you avoiding me?

245
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
Are you still mad at me?

246
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,520
Are you angry because I didn’t listen to you?

247
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Or because I didn’t hold you at that moment?

248
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,280
Or because

249
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
I haven’t killed Xue Lie

250
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,120
and Yuwen Muyuan to revenge for you?

251
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,880
Why don’t you come to see me,
not even in the form of ghost…

252
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,810
Do you like this?

253
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,800
…after you passed away?

254
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
Now that you’re gone,

255
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,400
no one presents me

256
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,560
with fresh flowers anymore.

257
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,240
Didn’t you promise

258
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,080
to give me flowers every day
for one hundred years?

259
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,120
And you also promised

260
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,160
to spend the rest of your life with me,
didn’t you?

261
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
It was you

262
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,320
who put this red cord on my wrist.

263
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,840
You said

264
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,720
the red cord

265
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,680
would draw you back to me.

266
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,480
Now I’m here.

267
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,000
But where are you?

268
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,480
You said that

269
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,000
if I was gone,

270
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
you would not live on alone.

271
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,560
Then why

272
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,080
do you leave me here alone?

273
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,760
Tou,

274
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
will I see you again

275
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,440
if I avenge you?

276
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
Do you miss me

277
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,760
in that world?

278
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
Is this a dream,

279
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,960
or am I terribly drunk?

280
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
Tou?

281
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,400
Are you Tou?

282
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,200
You’re back, Tou.

283
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,520
Tou.

284
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,760
Tou.

285
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,640
You…

286
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,440
Don’t leave me alone anymore.

287
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
You know what pain I am in

288
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
to live alone in this world?

289
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,320
Tou, don’t leave me alone!

290
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,200
Tou.

291
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Tou.

292
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,000
Miss,

293
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,740
I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else.

294
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,080
I come from

295
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,840
Jingzhou.

296
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,610
My name is Yu Chuzhi.

297
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,680
Tou,

298
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,450
what are you talking about?

299
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,970
You must be drunk, lady.

300
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
But I would kindly remind you

301
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,520
to behave yourself.

302
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,280
I’ve been picturing that

303
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,040
you’d come back some day.

304
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,320
And I’ve been picturing

305
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
how you’d come back.

306
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,380
I’ve been picturizing

307
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,680
how you fell off the cliff

308
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,460
and were smashed into pieces.

309
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,080
I’ve been imagining

310
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,680
how you were destroyed by beasts.

311
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,360
I…

312
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,880
I even thought about that

313
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,440
you might become a wandering ghost.

314
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,960
But…

315
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,560
But I’ve never thought about

316
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,160
that you’d show up in front of me,

317
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,760
yet pretending to be stranger.

318
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,560
Tou,

319
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,880
are you a human being or a ghost?

320
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,000
Miss,

321
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,520
I’ve told you just now

322
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,930
that you’ve mistaken me for someone else.

323
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,090
My name is Yu Chuzhi.

324
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,000
Liar!

325
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,760
You are lying, right?

326
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,200
You must be lying!

327
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,780
You told me before.

328
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,400
You told me that you didn’t like me at all.

329
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,130
You made a promise to me.

330
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,120
You promised to take me back to the Moon Valley.

331
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,000
You said that

332
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
no matter what happened,

333
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,160
you’d tell me the truth.

334
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
You said that

335
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
no matter what happened,

336
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,960
we would never be apart.

337
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,800
You promised me

338
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,040
that you’d come back from Dongdu

339
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,880
in three days.

340
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,560
But you’ve failed to keep all these promises.

341
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,220
Now you still want to lie to me?

342
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,600
Tou!

343
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,480
Miss,

344
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
I can understand why

345
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,090
you’ve mistaken me.

346
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Because you are not the first one

347
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,080
to do so.

348
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,300
When I first came here,

349
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,940
the shopkeeper

350
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
also mistook me for another person.

351
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,920
She only believed me

352
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,420
after questioning me many times.

353
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,890
My family name is Yu,

354
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,420
given name Chuzhi.

355
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,420
I was born in the year of Xin You

356
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
in Jingzhou.

357
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,010
My family is a dealer of paintings.

358
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,800
I heard that

359
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,530
there are many talents here in Suzhou.

360
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,520
That was why

361
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,960
my father sent me here

362
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,160
to purchase some nice paintings

363
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,680
and bring them back for sale.

364
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
You’re lying.

365
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,440
That’s not true, Tou.

366
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,560
You are the Leader of Moon Valley.

367
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,760
You…

368
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,800
You are the son of the Imperial Advisor.

369
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,880
You are my Tou!

370
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
You are lying, Tou.

371
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,960
Tou, don’t leave.

372
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,200
Tou.

373
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,080
Tou, don’t leave.

374
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,040
It’s OK if you want to be a stranger.

375
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,920
But please don’t leave.

376
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,400
I will avenge you.

377
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,320
I will kill them all.

378
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,880
I will avenge you.

379
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,320
Just don’t leave, Tou.

380
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
Don’t you leave me.

381
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,520
Don’t leave.

382
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
Don’t leave.

383
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
Stay here.

384
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,800
Tou, don’t leave.

385
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,680
Miss.

386
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Don’t leave, Tou.

387
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,200
Tou.

388
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Tou, don’t leave.

389
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,840
Tou, don’t leave.

390
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
Tou.

391
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
Don’t leave me.

392
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,680
Don’t leave me.

393
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,040
Don’t leave me.

394
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,960
Miss,

395
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
you are drunk.

396
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,360
I am sober.

397
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,040
Shangguan Tou,

398
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,480
you are a liar!

399
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Why do you leave me alone here?

400
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,520
Don’t leave me.

401
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,520
Miss…

402
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,560
Don’t leave me.

403
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,930
I’m not the man you refer to.

404
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Don’t leave me.

405
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,120
Don’t leave me.

406
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,370
The lady is terribly drunk.

407
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,410
Please take care of her.

408
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,600
Hongxiu.

409
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,920
I think she’ll wake up soon.

410
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,810
You’d better not stay here.

411
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,240
You’re right.

412
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,050
She’ll get over-excited again

413
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
if she sees me.

414
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,800
This is my fault.

415
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,240
I was careless.

416
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,080
I haven’t drunk for a long time

417
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,010
and I didn’t know

418
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,060
two cups of wine would put me down.

419
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,220
It’s not your fault, Hongxiu.

420
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
It’s my fault.

421
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,280
I missed her so much

422
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
that I couldn’t help following her.

423
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
Then

424
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,220
she caught sight of me.

425
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,520
Tou,

426
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
what’s this about?

427
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,760
You two

428
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,920
love each another.

429
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,690
You’d meet sooner or later.

430
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,380
What’s the point of avoiding her?

431
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,210
There’s no such man as Tou in the world.

432
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,160
Shangguan Tou

433
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,000
was executed the day

434
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600
when he attempted to assassinate Lord Lu.

435
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
Xuezhi

436
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,160
should also accept this fact.

437
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,360
Don’t you trust Xuezhi?

438
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,970
Xue Lie is cunning and suspicious.

439
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,680
Only when Xuezhi believes that I’m dead

440
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,210
will Xue Lie believe it too.

441
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,520
And only then

442
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,960
will he be less alarmed.

443
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,360
So we can seize the chance

444
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,960
when he lets down his guard

445
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,280
to defeat him in one shot.

446
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,440
But Xuezhi will suffer a lot.

447
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,050
I promised the Crown Prince

448
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,450
that I’d find out Xue Lie’s hidden agenda.

449
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,970
Because I not only want
to pay back His Highness’s kindness,

450
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,880
but also want to protect Xuezhi.

451
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,420
Even after he got rid of me,

452
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,770
Xue Lie will still think
that Xuezhi is in his way.

453
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,880
He won’t let her go.

454
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,880
If I act in the dark,

455
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,600
it’ll be easier to protect Xuezhi

456
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,800
from assassination.

457
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,440
Besides,

458
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,040
if Xue Lie is alive,

459
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,360
my father

460
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,850
and my sister will never rest in peace.

461
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,290
My father’s name has not been cleared,

462
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,330
and my sister was forced to die.

463
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,360
With all the history,

464
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,920
how can I not hate him?

465
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,280
I will let him

466
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,680
pay the price.

467
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Hongxiu.

468
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
You must be tipsy.

469
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
Please go and have a rest.

470
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,880
And please

471
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,480
tell Xuezhi

472
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,360
when she wakes up

473
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,520
that Yu Chuzhi

474
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,240
is not Shangguan Tou.

475
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,840
This is the Kylin Pill.

476
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,560
It comes from another nation.

477
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,520
Take it,

478
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
and your inner power will be boosted up.

479
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
It’ll help you

480
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,660
breakthrough and master the ninth move.

481
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,800
I made it!

482
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320
I made it!

483
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
I made it!

484
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,400
I made it!

485
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,560
I did it!

486
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,160
Mr. Xia,

487
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,360
congratulations on mastering the ninth move.

488
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,640
Your Highness.

489
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Thank you very much, Your Highness.

490
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,820
Without your help,

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,800
I couldn’t have mastered the Nine Moves

492
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,930
in such a short time.

493
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Mr. Xia,

494
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640
this is nothing

495
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,740
worth speaking of.

496
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,920
I’m not able to practice martial arts,

497
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,120
so why not help others achieve success?

498
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,660
Your Highness,

499
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,040
why is that?

500
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,200
Well, I’ve been suffering from

501
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,060
heart issue ever since I was a kid.

502
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,560
So I can’t practice martial arts.

503
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,320
That’s why I can only put my faith in

504
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,920
intelligent martial artist

505
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
like you, Mr. Xia.

506
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,520
I feel relieved

507
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,920
to see you

508
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,050
mastering such a marvelous skill.

509
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,200
From now on,

510
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,530
you’re undoubtedly the No.1 in the world.

511
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,840
But how come the No.1 in the world

512
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,360
lives in

513
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,560
a shabby village in the wild?

514
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,280
Fate

515
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
is not fair to you.

516
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,210
I’ve not been resourceful.

517
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,810
I have no way to put my capabilities

518
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,760
to good use.

519
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,840
Mr. Xia,

520
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,159
don’t underestimate yourself.

521
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,560
If you like it,

522
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,190
this will be

523
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,280
the very chance for you

524
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,710
to put your capabilities to good use.

525
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,190
Well,

526
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,120
please get it straight, Your Highness.

527
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,320
You know that

528
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,800
the Sects Alliance is about to be set up.

529
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,630
I will

530
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,960
be faced with many threats

531
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,630
from other sects.

532
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,480
They don’t understand my purpose and ambition

533
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,120
and just try to go against me.

534
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,280
I want you

535
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,120
to clear the way

536
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,280
for the unity of the martial arts world.

537
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,400
That’s how

538
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,190
you will

539
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,600
prove you are the No.1 in the world.

540
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,480
You’re awake.

541
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
I’ve cooked some porridge for you.

542
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,730
Would you like to have some?

543
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,880
Thank you.

544
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Sorry for troubling you.

545
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,480
By the way,

546
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
where’s Hongxiu?

547
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
She’s a bit drunk,

548
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,440
so she’s sleeping in her room.

549
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
How did I come back

550
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,120
last night?

551
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,400
Miss,

552
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
you were terribly drunk.

553
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,000
Last night, it was Mr. Yu,
the man who resembles Master Shangguan,

554
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
who brought you back by holding you.

555
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,600
And you were gripping his hands tight

556
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
and would not let him go.

557
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,760
I think you’ve mistaken him.

558
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,720
I come from

559
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Jingzhou.

560
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,730
My name is Yu Chuzhi.

561
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,980
Where is he now?

562
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,900
He’s in the painting room.

563
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,330
How much do you know about this man?

564
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,000
Not more than you do.

565
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,560
He’s been here for merely 4-5 days.

566
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,160
At first, we all thought
that he was Shangguan Tou.

567
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,720
Hongxiu was shocked too.

568
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
It was after investigation

569
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,320
that we finally realized that he was not.

570
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,720
What has he done here?

571
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,480
Watching the paintings
in the painting room mostly.

572
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
Sometimes having a walk around,

573
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
and watching people dancing and singing.

574
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,200
He doesn’t talk much,

575
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,800
that’s where he’s different from

576
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Master Shangguan.

577
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,260
When will he come back?

578
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,960
In the afternoon.

579
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,080
Miss!

580
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,940
[The Poem of Two Adorable Girls]

581
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,640
Thank you for

582
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,920
your help last night.

583
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,450
You’re welcome.

584
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,560
Are you sober now?

585
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
You are studious, aren’t you?

586
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,120
I’m flattered.

587
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,850
This is nothing like a classic.

588
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,720
Why do you read this book?

589
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,770
I want to know what the life was like

590
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,560
back in the Jin Dynasty.

591
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,560
I’d also like to know

592
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,920
the difference in the life styles

593
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,160
of the contemporary

594
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,240
and the past.

595
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,760
So you are interested

596
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
in history?

597
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,800
That’s right.

598
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,080
All I wanted

599
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,560
was to be a scholar.

600
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,320
But then

601
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,850
my father wanted me to take over
the family business.

602
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,560
Honestly,

603
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,640
I know nothing

604
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,960
about doing business.

605
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,320
Right,

606
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
may I know your name, please?

607
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,960
My name’s Chong Xuezhi.

608
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
Chong Xuezhi.

609
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,860
That means the divine ganoderma in snow.

610
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,480
What a good name!

611
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,200
Shangguan Tou.

612
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
I beg your pardon?

613
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,680
You are Tou, aren’t you?

614
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,400
This name again, huh?

615
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,240
But that makes me curious

616
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,080
about how similar

617
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
I look to Master Shangguan.

618
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,640
Sorry.

619
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,080
Excuse me.

620
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,360
Xuezhi.

621
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,960
They told me

622
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,020
that you’ve met Yu Chuzhi.

623
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,520
Hongxiu,

624
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,080
tell me,

625
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,640
he’s Tou, right?

626
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,920
I…I want him to be too.

627
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,560
But he’s not Tou indeed.

628
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,800
How come?

629
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,080
How could there be

630
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,760
two identical men

631
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
in this world?

632
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
I was given a fright

633
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,490
the first time I met him.

634
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,450
He struck me as Shangguan Tou, too.

635
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,180
But after sounding him out

636
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,460
I realized that he was not Tou.

637
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Tou was not dull and boring like that man.

638
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,840
The moment I saw him last night,

639
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,040
I thought I was in dream.

640
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,730
But then I found out that

641
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,400
it’s reality.

642
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,280
You know

643
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,520
how much I wished

644
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,880
him to be Tou at that time?

645
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,520
But I was told that

646
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,440
he was not.

647
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,680
Why?

648
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,760
Why does fate

649
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
tease me like this?

650
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,840
Xuezhi,

651
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,000
I understand

652
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,760
your sorrow.

653
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,200
But…

654
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,600
But Tou

655
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,120
is dead.

656
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,400
You must accept the fact.

657
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,360
Xuezhi,

658
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,200
you can never

659
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,560
mistake him for Tou.

660
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,360
Hongxiu,

661
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,770
what are you talking about?

662
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,040
No one compares with Tou in my heart.

663
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,400
How can I mistake the man for Tou?

664
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
I won’t do that

665
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
even if they look identical.

666
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,720
Xuezhi,

667
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,560
I…

668
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,120
Fengzi, I’m back.

669
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,200
Fengzi.

670
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,760
Stop eating this kind of food.

671
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,420
They are not delicious at all.

672
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,220
Look what I’ve bought for you.

673
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,980
Health tonics.

674
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,140
These are health tonics, too.

675
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,850
A big drumstick.

676
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,160
And this

677
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,920
is specially for you.

678
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,450
Your favorite sugar cakes.

679
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,290
Come and help yourself.

680
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,400
Let me feed you.

681
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,320
Come on.

682
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,010
I’ve told you

683
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
I wouldn’t eat these things.

684
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,040
These...

685
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,570
These are all your favorite foods.

686
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,320
It’s sweet. Try it.

687
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,520
Don’t buy them for me again.
