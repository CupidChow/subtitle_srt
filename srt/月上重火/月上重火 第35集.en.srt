00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 35

4
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,760
Uncle.

5
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,960
Are you getting used to no rules?

6
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
Who do you think I am?

7
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,480
I am not at your command.

8
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,760
When people don’t need my help,

9
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
they avoid me.

10
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,640
When they do,

11
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
they take advantage of me.

12
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Chong Xuezhi

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,040
lost His Majesty’s weapons.

14
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
She is a dead woman.

15
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
Shangguan Xingzhou abused authority

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
to keep her alive.

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,079
If it weren't for you, uncle,

18
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,680
I would have brought her to justice.

19
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,680
Professionally or personally,

20
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,560
I don’t have to save her.

21
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,880
I know she is your adopted daughter

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,680
and Shangguan Tou's sweetheart.

23
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,100
Your relationship with Shangguan Tou is close.

24
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,340
But let me tell you something.

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
Ever since you abandoned your Lordship

26
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,290
and entered the Hall of Flames,

27
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,160
you’ve become too close
to the martial arts world.

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,020
Be careful of getting backfired.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,520
Shangguan Tou

30
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
is Her Highness’s brother.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,620
You know Chong Xuezhi's relationship with Tou.

32
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
Why go to such lengths?

33
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,000
Killing Xuezhi is no different than

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
killing your own family.

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
Aren't you afraid
you'll break your wife’s heart?

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
Uncle.

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I see you still don't know

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
about Imperial Advisor.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Imperial Advisor died in prison

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,300
because of the Hall of Flames.

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,079
He's Zheng's father.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
If it's for Zheng,

43
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I should kill Chong Xuezhi

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,160
and avenge my family.

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
It’s meant to be.

46
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:47,280
And I won't have the slightest burden.

47
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,120
You know the truth

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,520
about the Imperial Advisor.

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
I don't want to argue.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
I just want

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,120
to implore you.

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,520
Just for the sake of being of the same blood

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
and the love of husband and wife

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,460
between you and Her Highness,

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
think of it as a way

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,839
to understand the pain of Her Highness,

57
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
please give me the cure,

58
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,079
so I can save Xuezhi.

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
I

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,010
would much appreciate.

61
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I'm afraid I have to disappoint you.

62
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,400
I can't

63
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,520
give you the cure.

64
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
Because I don't have it.

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
Tou.

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
You said

67
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,730
you would cut flowers for me for 100 years,

68
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,680
and you did.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,120
Too bad your flowers are still blooming

70
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,760
and I'm dying.

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Tou.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,120
Thank you for being in my life.

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
In the days to come,

74
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,240
I will become the moon to accompany you

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
and not let you be alone.

76
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,440
I will remember your face,

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,920
and meet you in the next life.

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,240
Then we'll go back to the mountain

79
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,560
and be a normal married couple.

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,960
Until death do us apart.

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Uncle Lin.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Uncle Lin.

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,240
I'm Shangguan Tou's sister,

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Shangguan Zheng.

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
Your Highness.

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,220
No need for the formality.

87
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,560
My maid has

88
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
informed me of your visit.

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
I know Ms. Chong's

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,400
life is at stake.

91
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
You... You

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,620
just talked to Lord Lu?

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes.

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
You have the cure for the Wuse Skill?

95
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,409
I'm not sure yet.

96
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,480
But I will not stand by and watch

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,140
Tou losing the woman he loves.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,200
Please wait outside the woods of west gate.

99
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,200
I'll find a way to get it to you

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
as soon as I can.

101
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,520
Thank you so much.

102
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,960
In the future,

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,400
I will repay the favor.

104
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,420
You don't have to thank me.

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
I should be thanking you.

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
These days,

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,640
thank you for taking care of Tou and Ms. Chong.

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,880
I can't

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,400
thank you enough.

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,160
Right.

111
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,680
Then wait for me.

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,200
Tou.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How long has uncle been out?

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,920
Has it been ten days?

115
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,370
It's been over half a month.

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
You have been

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,600
by my side for half a month.

118
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,240
I feel

119
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
like a gift.

120
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,640
As if Heaven

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,000
felt my heart,

122
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,159
and gave me this half a month of time,

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,520
so that I can have

124
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,640
this beautiful memory.

125
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Xuezhi.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,880
You and I

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,880
have lots of time

128
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,520
to be together.

129
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Whoever it is,

130
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,520
they can't take you away from me.

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,080
Lin will be back soon.

132
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,080
When he returns,

133
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,720
you will heal.

134
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Xuezhi.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
When you get well,

136
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,040
what would you most like to do?

137
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,080
When I first came to Moon Valley,

138
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
I wanted to learn Guqin,

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
but I didn't have time then.

140
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
When I heal,

141
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,440
I hope

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you can teach me.

143
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,560
Sure.

144
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
Whether it is Guqin

145
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
or go,

146
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,820
I will play it with you.

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Zheng.

148
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
I know you sent your maid to spy on me.

149
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
Aren’t you afraid I find out this

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,640
and get upset?

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,080
I don't care

152
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
if you're angry now.

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,100
Give me the cure for Ms. Chong.

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,850
I don't know how to save her,

155
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
and I don't want to.

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,520
I have a passion for you.

157
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,680
I thought you knew better,

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
but you're giving me the runaround?

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
Runaround?

160
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,040
Zheng.

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
I already promised you

162
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
I wouldn't touch Shangguan Tou.

163
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Why are you interfering with me?

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
Xue Lie.

165
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,880
Do you know what you're doing right now?

166
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,840
You're killing innocent people.

167
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,920
You are dooming yourself!

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
All I want is to make

169
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
the entire martial arts world obey me!

170
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,640
And then what?

171
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,600
And then…

172
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,760
Then I am the supreme!

173
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
That’s not the point.

174
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,400
All you want is to protect

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,120
your fragile ego!

176
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,760
Xue Lie.

177
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,680
I know you have a medical condition.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,860
You couldn't learn martial arts.

179
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,320
And you can’t get His Majesty’s attention.

180
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
You just want to control the martial arts world

181
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,370
and prove yourself!

182
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,280
Zheng.

183
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,640
How can you say such a thing?

184
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,560
What I want

185
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,680
is to make peace for the world!

186
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,680
You killed innocent people.

187
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,640
You persecuted the Hall of Flames and killed

188
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,500
my father for the sake of harmony?

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,320
You just do it for killing.

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,960
You’re ruining yourself!

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,200
You're wrong, Zheng!

192
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,480
I will not ruin myself,

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,720
but make myself!

194
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Xue Lie.

195
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,180
Take care of yourself.

196
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,160
Zheng.

198
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
You are my only wife.

199
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,760
You're not going anywhere

200
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,280
but staying here!

201
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,980
From this day forward,

202
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,900
you reflect on your misdeeds!

203
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,060
From this day forward,

204
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,900
don't you ever touch me again.

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,680
Master Lin.

206
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
Her Highness was caught by Lord Lu

207
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,560
and grounded

208
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,720
in the mansion.

209
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,060
Please tell her I said thanks.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,780
Go back and look after her.

211
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,520
Yes.

212
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,840
How's Xuezhi?

213
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,360
I've stabilized her with

214
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,240
ice method.

215
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,580
But I got some bad news for you.

216
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,010
We bought all the ice

217
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,730
out of the nearby ice rooms.

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
And the ice in our own ice room

219
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,680
has melted away.

220
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Uncle.

221
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
Uncle.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,680
Xuezhi.

223
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,920
Uncle.

224
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,360
It’s alright.

225
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
I knew this

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,040
was going to happen.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,160
Thank you

228
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
for everything.

229
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,200
It's all in my heart.

230
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,200
In life,

231
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,820
there's always an end.

232
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Although I’m going to leave faster,

233
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,560
you’re all by my side

234
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
the whole time,

235
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,880
so I’m afraid of nothing.

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
I hope

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,080
I could live

238
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,320
my last days in peace.

239
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,400
All right?

240
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,840
Tou.

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
What is this?

242
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,220
My Heart’s Name is Zhi.

243
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,580
My Heart’s Name is Zhi?

244
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,440
It’s the Zhi in your name.

245
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,760
My heart

246
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,340
for your heart.

247
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,020
I know we’re deeply loved.

248
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,450
It's beautiful.

249
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,480
Every time I play this song,

250
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
I think of you,

251
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
think of us,

252
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
and think of all we've been through,

253
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,880
it's all there in my mind.

254
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
Tou.

255
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,040
This

256
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,280
is left by my father,

257
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
and whenever I miss him,

258
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,240
I take it out and look at it.

259
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
I know after I’m gone,

260
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,120
you’ll miss me.

261
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
So now,

262
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,860
I’m giving this to you.

263
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,640
Whenever you think of me,

264
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
just look at it,

265
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,320
like

266

[Huashan Sect]

268
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,760
His Highness has always relied on you

269
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,280
and remembered

270
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,000
your help.

271
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Since you've done your part,

272
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,800
His Highness will return the favor

273
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,440
as his appreciation.

274
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
But now that

275
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,080
the Hall of Flames

276
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,320
is gone though,

277
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,400
all heroes

278
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,720
are divided and cannot be united.

279
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,080
His Highness wants to form a sects alliance,

280
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,360
so to gather the world's martial artists.

281
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Then we can unify the world of martial arts,

282
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
and all sects

283
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
can support each other

284
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
and grow together.

285
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,320
Chief.

286
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,920
What do you think?

287
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,800
His Highness is thoughtful,

288
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,280
far-sighted

289
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
and powerful.

290
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,280
I wonder

291
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
if His Highness told you

292
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
about the leader

293
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,920
of this alliance?

294
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,600
The position of leader is very important.

295
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
It’s for those

296
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,900
who deserve it, of course.

297
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,600
It’s a fair decision.

298
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,540
Thank His Highness for his recognition.

299
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
So you're volunteering now?

300
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,320
The position of leader

301
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,560
is a great responsibility.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,960
I wonder if you

303
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,720
have that kind of prestige?

304
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,760
It's good to have a will.

305
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,800
If you are interested,

306
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,120
then help His Highness

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
to win the people.

308
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,360
Tell him not to worry.

309
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,400
His Highness’s matter

310
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,760
is mine too.

311
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,840

I don't need to tell you.

318

This kind of workmanship

319

is rare in the market.

made by the Hall of Flames?

you take it

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,360
be magnanimous

352
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,860
and cut him some slack?

353
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,520
After all, it's time

354
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,450
to focus on the martial arts world.

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
For a desperate man,

356
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,960
there’s no need to waste your time.

357
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,560
Lord Lu promised me

358
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,720
to avenge my father's death.

359
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,200
He did.

360
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,000
But,

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,730
it doesn’t have to be personal.

362
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,560
He who wants to accomplish great things

363
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
must broaden his horizon.

364
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,480
After all, Yuwen is worth

365
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
more alive

366
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
than dead.

367
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,880
Is this

368
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,520
what Lord Lu wants?

369
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
You may be a great warrior,

370
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,400
but to serve His Highness long-term,

371
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,280
you'll need to think more

372
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,800
about the Lord’s mind.

373
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,840
How does Huashan Sect

374
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,760
end up with such an idiot Chief?

375
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,360
Feng Mo is clumsy

376
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,720
and young.

377
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,960
In the world of martial arts,

378
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,440
he is infamous.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,800
And he doesn't have a strong base

380
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,360
in his Huashan Sect.

381
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
He has a quick temper

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,080
and knows nothing about running his men.

383
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,040
Besides, his words were offensive towards you several times.

384
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,000
I think

385
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
keeping him around

386
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
is going to get you

387
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,960
in trouble one day.

388
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,160
But now I have no one.

389
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
In that case,

390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,000
I should find someone

391
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,560
to replace him.

392
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,460
Your Highness.

393
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,960
This trip of Huashan Sect

394
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,320
brought a surprise.

395
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,560
A surprise?

396
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,080
Tell me about it.

397
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,400
Feng Mo may be stupid,

398
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,480
but he found

399
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,120
Yuwen Muyuan.

400
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,440
I took the liberty

401
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
of keeping

402
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
him alive.

403
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
Yuwen Muyuan?

404
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Where is he?

405
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,280
They say

406
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,600
he showed up at a pawnshop

407
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
in Qiongzhou,

408
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,520
and almost

409
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,960
pawned his old sword.

410
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,080
As you can imagine,

411
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
this man now

412
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,920
is the underdog

413
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,760
and all alone.

414
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,960
Pawned his sword.

415
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
Chief Guardian really is

416
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,760
getting ready to retire.

417
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,480
But you didn't let

418
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,800
Feng Mo kill him,

419
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,960
it must

420
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,760
mean something else.

421
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,900
Your Highness is wise.

422
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
Yuwen Muyuan

423
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,280
did turn you down before.

424
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,040
But things are different now.

425
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,440
Now the Hall of Flames is gone.

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
Chong Xuezhi is with Shangguan Tou.

427
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,120
Now he

428
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
is alone.

429
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,240
If we can find

430
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,840
his weak spot now,

431
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,960
he will

432
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,620
be of use to Your Highness.

433
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,560
You're right.

434
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,420
The Hall of Flames is gone.

435
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,440
But Chong Xuezhi is alive.

436
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,280
I do feel

437
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,610
things are not done yet.

438
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,480
Yuwen Muyuan

439
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,360
is a useful man.

440
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,040
If I can recruit him,

441
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,680
he can be

442
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,200
a great asset.

443
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
If you wish it,

444
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,930
I will do everything in my power

445
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
to make it happen for Your Highness.

446
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,760
Tou.

447
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,000
When I'm gone,

448
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,920
will anyone come with you to see the flowers?

449
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,460
Don't be silly.

450
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,160
Everyone knows that

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,080
Master Shangguan of Dongdu

452
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,400
is handsome

453
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,880
and unique.

454
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,480
You deserve the best woman

455
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,560
in this world to cherish you.

456
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,640
It's just

457
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,840
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

458
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Don't you dare say anything stupid.

459
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,170
You're not allowed to leave me.

460
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,900
You can't give up on yourself.

461
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,760
Understand?

462
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,440
I want to be

463
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,440
with you for all eternity.

464
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,840
Look, Tou,

465
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,080
the hibiscus

466
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
is gone.

467
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,400
I promised you

468
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,410
that I would give you something

469
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,920
important to me,

470
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,640
that is, in the rest of my life,

471
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,900
you are my one and only.

472
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,680
I did it.

473
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,640
I kept my word.

474
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Tou.

475
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,160
Do you remember

476
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,120
what you said

477
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,000
to me here?

478
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,360
I do.

479
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,240
If you say yes,

480
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm yours.

481
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,320
Then in the next life,

482
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,760
we shall rely on these words.

483
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
As long as we hear them,

484
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,800
we can recognize

485
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
each other.

486
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,880
Xuezhi.

487
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,760
Xuezhi?

488
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,240
Xuezhi!

489
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Ms. Chong is now in

490
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,500
a life-and-death situation.

491
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,240
Her Qi and blood are blocked.

492
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,370
Vessels are closed.

493
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,600
Even the Lotus Sutra

494
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,770
can't protect her internal power.

495
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm afraid…

496
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,600
Master,

497
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,970
where are you going?

498
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,450
I’m going to see Lord Lu.

499
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Brother Yin.

500
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,020
I knew you got something else.

501
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
If she were beyond saved,

502
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,300
you wouldn’t be like this.

503
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,520
I also know that your methods

504
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,600
will be extreme.

505
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
Dangerous, even.

506
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,100
But we don't have a choice now.

507
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,320
Tell us.

508
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,560
Come with me.

509
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
This is the most

510
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,280
poisonous poison I've ever developed.

511
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,620
It’s made by the blood of black mylabris.

512
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,600
A poison?

513
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,040
But how will the poison save her?

514
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,300
May not work on others.

515
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,530
It not only can’t save life,

516
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,220
but fatal with half a drop.

517
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,160
But don't you forget,

518
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,040
Ms. Chong

519
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,020
had taken Poison Immune Pill.

520
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,040
You mean

521
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,520
fight fire with fire?

522
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,650
But all poisons are inviolable to her,

523
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,840
so how could she be poisoned?

524
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,280
Because of her constitution,

525
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,680
after taking the poison,

526
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,920
the Qi and blood may begin to flow

527
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,840
and in response to detoxification.

528
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,480
Perhaps,

529
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,560
at this moment, a poison

530
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,280
can make her already stagnant pulses

531
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
circulate again.

532
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,580
Give her life back for a while.

533
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,520
But…

534
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
But as Master Lin said,

535
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,130
it's a double-edged sword.

536
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,360
If we succeed,

537
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,040
we can save Xuezhi's life for now.

538
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,960
If…

539
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,200
Right.

540
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,120
If Ms. Chong's

541
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,600
own survival Qi

542
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,640
is not sufficient to sustain

543
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,400
this detoxification process,

544
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,840
she will die instantly.

545
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,480
How sure are you?

546
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Half-half tops.

547
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,940
It's the last thing

548
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,960
I can think of right now.

549
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Leader.

550
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,060
I know this is hard for you.

551
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,600
But Ms. Chong

552
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,100
can't wait any longer.

553
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,280
Her breath grows weaker

554
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,520
by the minute.

555
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,140
If it goes on like this,

556
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,730
her chances of survival
are going to get smaller.

557
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,760
Wait and die,

558
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,200
or risk it all,

559
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,440
it’s your choice.

560
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,560
But that's no different

561
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,720
than killing her myself.

562
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,480
As Xuezhi's uncle,

563
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,770
I want her alive and well more than anyone.

564
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,090
But none of us can help her make that decision.

565
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,400
Yin Ci.

566
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
Let's get out of here.

567
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,280
Let him think about it.

568
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,680
Sure.

569
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,440
I’ll do some acupuncture for her

570
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,040
to buy you some time.

571
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,000
Why didn’t you

572
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
ask me

573
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,040
who I want to protect?

574
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,480
Because you said I didn't know her.

575
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,840
Then why would I ask?

576
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,120
I can tell you right now

577
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,640
that the person I want to protect

578
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,960
is…

579
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,560
It’s you.

580
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Xuezhi.

581
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,560
Is this how I protect you?

582
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,360
Master!

583
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,600
Master!

584
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Ms. Chong is alive.

585
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,240
It just

586
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,240
seems like she's been through a lot,

587
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,370
and she's been vomiting a lot of blood.

588
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,520
Master.

589
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,700
Have you ever thought that

590
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,480
how long are you going to

591
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
hold on to her?

592
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,080
Wuming.

593
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,520
Leave me.

594
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,280
I want to be alone for a while.

595
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Today brings back memories.

596
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,680
For the second time in my life, I was surrounded

597
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,240
by feelings of powerlessness and weakness.

598
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,560
Yupan sacrificed himself

599
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,480
to save Chong Ye.

600
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,280
It was the first time in my life that

601
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,740
I felt the pain of losing someone close to me.

602
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
When I thought I could keep Chong Ye,

603
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,370
Chong Ye chose to leave as well.

604
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,820
That's when I realized

605
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,170
there's no such thing as eternity.

606
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,320
Even if you do not give up,

607
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,420
these things belong to you

608
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,210
will leave you eventually.

609
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,840
Loss

610
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,520
cannot be stopped,

611
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,760
but you keep it in your heart,

612
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,280
it is eternal then, isn’t it?

613
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,280
Keep it in heart,

614
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,300
what if the heart dies?

615
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,560
That's why you don’t want

616
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,280
to find

617
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,720
someone and grow old together.

618
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,160
I thought

619
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,400
you'd let go of everything.

620
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,050
As long as you’re alive,

621
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,170
you can't let go of everything.

622
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,320
I remember this robe

623
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,440
I mended it.

624
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,150
It's really ugly.

625
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
I thought

626
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,360
you cut it into rags.

627
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,520
You mended it.

628
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,320
How could I?

629
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,960
Did you

630
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,320
like me

631
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,150
already back then?

632
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
I don’t know when it started.

633
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
When I see you smile,

634
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
I’ll be happy.

635
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,880
When I see you cry,

636
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
I feel sad.

637
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,760
But I just want to see you.

638
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,000
I want to look at you all the time.

639
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,520
Tou.

640
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,040
I wish that

641
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
after I die,

642
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,280
I could become the wind.

643
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,800
That way,

644
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
wherever you go,

645
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,160
I can find you.

646
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,800
If you become the wind,

647
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,680
then I'll be a cloud.

648
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Why?

649
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,300
Because the only thing

650
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,640
that can be together forever

651
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,900
is the wind and the clouds.

652
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,180
No matter where it comes from,

653
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,200
where it goes,

654
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
whether it goes or stops,

655
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,210
the clouds will follow the wind

656
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,770
to the ends of the world.

657
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,680
Tou.

658
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
I want,

659
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
while I still can,

660
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
to go to Winehouse of Fairyland

661
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
to see Hongxiu

662
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,640
and enjoy

663
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,600
the music and the dancing there.

664
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,920
Sure.

665
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,520
Wherever you go,

666
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,120
I'll be with you.

667
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,260
[Winehouse of Fairyland]

668
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Get some rest.

669
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,580
I'll be right outside.

670
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,720
Let me know if you need anything.

671
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,800
Sleep now.

672
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,760
Xuezhi grows weaker and weaker,

673
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,480
and less and less

674
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,880
awake.

675
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,880
Are you all right?

676
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,440
I heard all about

677
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,060
the Imperial Advisor.

678
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,760
My father is dead.

679
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,680
As his son,

680
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,660
I should have avenged my father's death.

681
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,080
But

682
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,450
my sister was caught in the middle.

683
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,610
After this change, my sister still

684
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,810
has to stay at Lord Lu’s Mansion

685
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,040
and be Xue Lie’s wife.

686
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,720
It must be

687
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
very hard for her.

688
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,080
I promised my father

689
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,140
I'd take care of my sister.

690
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,320
If I hurt Lord Lu,

691
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
my sister will be hurt too.

692
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,600
Besides,

693
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,760
Xuezhi’s life is at stake.

694
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,720
The most important thing

695
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,800
is to find a cure.

696
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,460
One way or another,

697
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,920
I'm keeping Xuezhi alive.

698
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,600
Hongxiu.

699
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,640
Rest assured.

700
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,480
I will never forget

701
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,450
the murder of my father.

702
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
I’ll settle this with Lord Lu

703
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,720
sooner or later.

704
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,800
It's just, right now,

705
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,810
I really don't want to hurt others.

706
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,600
I know you.

707
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,600
If there's anything

708
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,160
I can do for you and Xuezhi,

709
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,500
please don't hesitate to ask.

710
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,400
Hongxiu.

711
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,800
Have you ever heard of

712
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
the Wuse Skill?

713
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,000
Wuse Skill?

714
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,530
I've heard of it a few times.

715
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,200
But all I know is

716
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,730
that it's a strange skill from a foreign land.

717
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
But as for how to use it

718
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,800
or decipher it,

719
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,080
I have no idea.

720
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,960
Maybe it's fate.

721
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,160
Don't beat yourself up about it.

722
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,960
It's not

723
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,880
your fault.

724
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,770
Xuezhi wouldn't blame you.

725
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,120
That's why

726
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
I hate myself even more.

727
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,130
I hate that I can't do anything.

728
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
When Langya died,

729
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,570
I blamed myself,

730
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,920
just like you did.

731
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
I blame myself

732
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,360
for not agreeing to marry him sooner.

733
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,760
I even sometimes think

734
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,280
that if Heaven

735
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,840
would give me one more day with Langya,

736
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,080
even just one more day,

737
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,800
I would cherish it,

738
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,280
no fight or trouble.

739
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,400
At least when he left,

740
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,300
he would not only remember

741
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,120
my fierce look.

742
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,720
Shangguan Tou.

743
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,480
There's no turning back

744
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,900
when something's already happened.

745
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,920
If you don't want to regret it

746
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,850
for the rest of your life like I did,

747
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,480
then make the most of the time

748
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,120
she's around.

749
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,840
Don't let Xuezhi see

750
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,130
that you feel guilty

751
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,040
because of her.

752
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,400
And don’t let her

753
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,160
leave with worries.

754
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,520
My child,

755
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,720
I’m sorry.

756
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,600
Don't blame me for being selfish.

757
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,810
I don't want to deprive you of right to be born.

758
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,360
But I really did not expect that

759
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,600
your father is such

760
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,200
a heartless man.

761
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
I wish I could

762
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,480
see your pretty little face.

763
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,320
We may never see each other.

764
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
But it’s alright.

765
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,880
I’ll be with you forever.
