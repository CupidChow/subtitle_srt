Xuezhi.

9
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,680
Muyuan, don’t say anything.

10
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
I’ll take you back to treat.

11
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Muyuan!

12
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
It’s too late.

13
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,360
Actually,

14
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
I’m very happy

15
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,280
that you came to save me.

16
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,920
It’s my fault.

17
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,160
I couldn’t protect you.

18
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,660
Don’t say that.

19
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
It’s my duty

20
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,840
to protect you.

21
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,360
-Let me fly!
-But...

22
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,160
But you shouldn’t have protected me

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,680
in this way.

24
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,640
Because...

25
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
I am

26
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,360
used to it.

27
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Muyuan.

28
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,320
Xuezhi.

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,400
I’m here.

30
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
I’m here.

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
Don’t cry.

32
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,159
For my life,

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
I only love you.

34
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,280
I know.

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
No matter how deep my love is,

36
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,120
I...

37
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,920
I can’t have you.

38
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,720
But...

39
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
But I

40
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,560
never

41
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,840
regretted

42
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
this life,

43
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,960
I can’t be with you anymore in this life.

44
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
In the next life,

45
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
I

46
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,080
will still love you.

47
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
I will still

48
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
protect you

49
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,080
and be your guardian star.

50
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,520
May I?

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
Muyuan.

52
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,400
Xuezhi.

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,280
This...

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,760
This pair of earrings...

55
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Hope...

56
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,720
I hope you can take them.

57
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,250
As your brother,

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
I give you

59
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,040
the last gift.

60
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,880
Take them

61
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,800
as your dowry.

62
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,360
I hope

63
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,680
you can wear them

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,240
on your wedding day.

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
Could you promise me?

66
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,120
Muyuan.

67
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,560
Don’t talk.

68
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
I’ll take you back to Hall of Flames.

69
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
Hold on.

70
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,680
Muyuan. I’ll take you back.

71
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,200
I...

72
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
I...

73
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,880
can’t go back.

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
My life

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,240
has gone to the end.

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,850
Leader, take care of yourself.

77
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400
Your Chief Guardian,

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,440
Yuwen Muyuan,

79
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
will step down.

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Muyuan...

81
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Xuezhi.

82
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
I am with you.

83
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,720
No one will bully you.

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
I

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,880
protected you

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
as your brother.

87
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
But from now on,

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,340
I hope to protect you for your life

89
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
with another identity.

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,840
Will you marry me?

91
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,440
Is that a yes?

92
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Muyuan.

93
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
Muyuan!

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
Muyuan!

95

Muyuan.

101

You can’t leave us, Chief Guardian!

Don’t be impulsive.

106
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,280
Where are you going?

107
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,960
Revenge.

108
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,560
Xuezhi!

109
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,320
Calm down.

110
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
We need time.

111
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
We need time?

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
How much time do we have?

113
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
And how many failures

114
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
will we experience?

115
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,440
Xuezhi!

116
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,520
Xue Lie has guessed all the things.

117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
Do you know what will happen

118
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,520
if you go for him?

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,880
Leader.

120
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,960
We lost Chief Guardian.

121
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,680
We can’t lose you.

122
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,520
I beg you. Please don’t go.

123
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,760
Xuezhi.

124

-Leader.

Leader!

What should we do? Chief Guardian!

127
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,880
Leader!

128

Chief Guardian!

129
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,620
He died? That’s great!

130
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,760
Everyone should know

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,800
the result of disobedience

132
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,880
Shangguan Tou

133
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,440
is really stubborn.

134
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
You have forgiven him

135
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,040
for many times.

136
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,050
He doesn’t appreciate your kindness,

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,480
but goes against you.

138
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,560
We can’t show mercy to him.

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Chong Xuezhi and Shangguan Tou

140
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,740
are not our rivals.

141
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,960
They will be forgotten
by the martial arts world.

142
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Only I will be remembered.

143
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
Because I am the first one

144
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,680
to unite the martial arts world.

[Tomb of Chief Guardian Yuwen Muyuan]

146

Chief Guardian.

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
When you were with us,

148
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,800
we didn’t worry about anything.

149
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,690
Several days ago, I met you,

150
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,760
which made me think of the days

151
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
when we were at Hall of Flames together.

152
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,340
I also thought of Liuli

153
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,760
and Haitang.

154
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
I didn’t expect

155
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
that you left us this time.

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,960
I can’t believe it.

told us to bury you near Hall of Flames.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,480
Then, you can see Hall of Flames and us

161

at any time.

162
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,540

Will... Will you come to see me?

181
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,360
No.

182
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Why?

183
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,520
Because

184
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I will go somewhere far away from here.

185
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Where will you go?

186
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,920
A place

187
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
without troubles,

188
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,400
like

189
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,520
that shabby room.

190
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,370
I spent my happiest days

191
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
in there.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,880
Muyuan!

193
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,680
Muyuan.

194
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Muyuan!

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,330
Muyuan. Don’t leave me!

196
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,160
Xuezhi.

197
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,540
What happened?

198
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,480
Muyuan was in my dream.

199
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
You saw Muyuan in your dream?

200
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,880
It’s not a dream.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Xuezhi.

202
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,440
You are the one who Yuwen Muyuan cared for most.

203
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,240
You must live well,

204
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,480
which is the best way to repay him.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,600
Are you used to the life here?

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
Thanks to your care,

207
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,200
I’m good.

208
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
But is there information

209
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,520
about Xuezhi and Shangguan Tou?

210
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
When will they come back?

211
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,760
They...

212
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,800
They are back.

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Xuezhi.

214
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,900
Finally, you are back.

215
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,220
How’s it going?

216
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,960
Do you have information about Qingmei?

217
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,800
Don’t worry.

218
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,520
Mr. Xia is an adult.

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,130
You should take care

220
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,200
of yourself

221
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,640
and your baby.

222
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,320
By the way,

223
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
do you feel better?

224
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,280
Don’t worry. I’ve recovered.

225
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,220
Master Shangguan.

226
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
Thanks for bringing me here.

227
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,880
You saved Xuezhi before.

228
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,020
We should say “thanks” to you.

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,760
So

230
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,500
what did you get this time?

231
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Muyuan

232
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,520
left us

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,920
for saving me.

234
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,960
Fengzi!

235
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,280
Father.

236
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,480
Father.

237
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Father.

238
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
It’s fine that you are okay.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,460
I was so worried about you.

240
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,880
I am fine, father.

241
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,520
But

242
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,440
Qingmei is missing.

243
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,000
Don’t worry.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,300
I’ll take you home.

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,460
Let’s wait for Qingmei together.

246
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,880
Zongxing.

247
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,200
Changran.

248
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,320
Everyone.

249
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,400
I’m here for three things.

250
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,440
First,

251
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,840
say “thanks” to Tou and Xuezhi.

252
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Second,

253
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,560
take Fengzi home.

254
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,160
Third,

255
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,780
the most important thing,

256
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,800
discuss with you

257
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,760
about how to stop Xue Lie.

258
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,640
The easiest way is gathering

259
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,800
the martial artists who are against him.

260
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,260
We fight together.

261
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,920
This is a reasonable way.

262
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,960
But we have to

263
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,349
pay a lot.

264
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,960
We need a better way.

265
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,300
Xue Lie is considerate

266
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,140
and good at setting traps.

267
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,800
He even guessed

268
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,560
our thoughtful plan.

269
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,310
So it won’t work

270
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,440
if we just use regular ways

271
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,069
Xue Lie is smart,

272
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,260
but he went astray.

273
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,069
He is obsessive.

274
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,880
I’m afraid he can’t change.

275
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
We’ve tried many ways

276
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,640
to help him get rid of obsessiveness.

277
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,160
But his obsessiveness is too deep.

278
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,960
I’m afraid he can’t get out of it.

279
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,860
Now that he’s so stubborn,

280
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,480
we don’t need to stop him.

281
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,480
Just wait and see.

282
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
Could you tell us the details?

283
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,560
Tomatoes on sticks!

284
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
Come and see.

285
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
Lord Lu.

286
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,760
Why did you kidnap me?

287
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,280
Of course

288
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
I have my reasons.

289
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Where is Qingmei?

290
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,760
Where is he?

291
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
Did you take him away?

292
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,080
Xia Qingmei

293
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
is useless to me now.

294
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,360
I don’t care

295
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,340
whether he’s still alive.

296
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,880
But you

297
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,360
are a little useful to me.

298
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,600
What do you mean

299
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
“whether he’s still alive”?

300
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
What did you do to him?

301
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,040
What do you want to do?

302
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,920
If Mr. Lin does the task

303
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,480
that I give him well,

304
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,880
I won’t hurt you.

305
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,680
Xue Lie!

306
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,400
What do you mean?

307
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,280
What do you want my father to do? Come back!

308
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,240
Come back! Say it clearly!

309
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,320
Xue Lie!

310
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
Sir.

311
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,960
Seems that Lin Fengzi

312
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,880
doesn’t know that Xia Qingmei has died.

313
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,240
Lin Zongxing, the cunning guy,

314
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,720
succeeds in cheating her?

315
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,120
Poor parental love.

316
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,580
Your Highness.

317
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,850
Will the old guy, Lin Zongxing,

318
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,240
listen to us?

319
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,000
Lin Zongxing loves two things most.

320
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,160
First, Sword Manor and his reputation.

321
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,520
Second, his daughter.

322
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
Lin Fengzi is imprisoned by us.

323
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,480
He’ll listen to us.

324
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,980
[Yongxing Inn]

325
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,040
Are you Master Shangguan?

326
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,050
Here’s a letter for you.

327
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,180
Who wrote the letter?

328
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,620
[Master Shangguan
Hongxiu]

329
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,640
Hongxiu.

330
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
Hongxiu is great.

331
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,800
She knows that we are here?

332
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Your Highness,

333
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,600
as what we expected,

334
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
after Shangguan Tou and Chong Xuezhi

335
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,960
got our fake letter,

336
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,170
they left for Sword Manor from the inn.

337
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,800
Very good.

338
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
How did you prepare the things?

339
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,600
Your Highness,

340
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,760
we have made it ready.

341
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,080
There’s only one way between Xiangzhou
and Sword Manor,

342
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,760
Yangsong Mountain.

343
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
Based on their speed,

344
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,640
it may cost them about four days.

345
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,800
I buried Black Fires on their way.

346
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,680
Once Shangguan Tou and Chong Xuezhi appear,

347
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
the Black Fire bombs will explode.

348
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,520
I’m sure that their bodies will be hard to find.

349
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,560
Nice.

350
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,480
So nice.

351
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,160
Shangguan Tou.

352
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,260
I couldn’t kill you with my sword.

353
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,900
You didn’t die after falling from the cliff.

354
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,690
Even though you are a cat

355
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,760
with nine lives,

356
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
you can’t get away from it this time.

357
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,280
By the way.

358
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
How about other sects?

359
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,560
Everything is going under your order.

360
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,420
They are on the way to Sword Manor.

361
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,080
They may arrive in five days.

362
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
So great.

363
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,580
[Lord Xin’s Mansion]

364
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,160
Your Highness, you are back.

365
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,520
You’ve stayed in the palace
for a long time today.

366
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,400
Lord Lu

367
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120
needs a lesson.

368
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Those who were arrested
by the Imperial Guardians and you

369
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,930
told us the truth

370
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,440
before we had to torture them

371
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,200
to save their lives.

372
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Epidemic,

373
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,780
the case of Imperial Advisor,

374
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
and Black Fires.

375
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,420
This is what you took on the official way.

376
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
My father

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
asked an expert to check.

378
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,120
Its power is

379
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,770
frighteningly strong.

380
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
[Spirited Sword]

381
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Abbess Ciren.

382
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,040
Mr. Lin.

383
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,480
Everyone.

384
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
Abbess Ciren.

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,040
Thanks for coming.

386
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,200
Have a seat.

387
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,960
Please. Servants.

388
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,520
Please.

389
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,400
Serve tea.

390
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,920
Everyone.

391
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,560
Please.

392
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,600
How is Fengzi?

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,260
I called every sect to Sword Manor

394
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,160
under Lord Lu’s order.

395
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,860
When will he release my daughter?

396
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,760
Mr. Lin, don’t worry.

397
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,640
Ms. Lin is fine.

398
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,100
His Highness asked you

399
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
to put this powder

400
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
in their tea tomorrow.

401
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,040
What’s this?

402
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,400
Rest assured.

403
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Just

404
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,080
some knockout drops.

405
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,560
It won’t kill them.

406
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
His Highness wants to create Sects Alliance

407
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,960
to make a more peaceful

408
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,250
martial arts world.

409
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,040
But evil people slander His Highness.

410
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,440
Now in the martial arts world,

411
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,040
many people misunderstand His Highness.

412
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,720
He just wants to explain to others.

413
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,220
Why must he use the knockout drops

414
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,520
to explain?

415
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,440
Mr. Lin, you also know

416
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,320
that His Highness doesn’t practice martial arts.

417
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
So he uses this way

418
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,760
as a precaution

419
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,280
to protect himself.

420
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,720
All in all,

421
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,800
as long as you obey what His Highness ordered,

422
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,040
after tomorrow,

423
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,920
you will see your daughter.

424
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,520
No,

425
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
your daughter and your grandchild.

426
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,200
Mr. Lin.

427
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
Did you call us here

428
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,600
for Lord Lu’s Sects Alliance?

429
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,320
Yes.

430
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,320
I

431
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,800
invited you here

432
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
for this.

433
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,280
Mr. Lin.

434
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,850
Everyone in this martial arts world knows

435
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,760
that disciples of four sects died

436
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,840
from Nine Moves, including Sand Sect.

437
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,080
I’m afraid

438
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,080
it’s something to do with Hall of Flames.

439
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,320
It is said

440
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,960
that the murderer is your student,

441
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,040
Xia Qingmei.

442
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,240
I heard that

443
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
he was killed

444
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,640
by Yuwen Muyuan.

445
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,280
Is the information right?

446
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,960
In the letter,

447
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,120
it’s said that you know the details of it.

448
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,520
Now that

449
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,760
we are all here,

450
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,360
could you tell us the truth?

451
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,640
Yes, tell us.

452
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,360
Is the murderer Hall of Flames

453
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,280
or Xia Qingmei?

454
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Yuwen Muyuan submitted to Lord Lu.

455
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,920
We all know it.

456
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,240
Did Xia Qingmei also

457
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,040
submit to him?

458
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
Mr. Lin.

459
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,970
Recently, rumors are running high

460
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,760
in the martial arts world.

461
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,000
If you know something,

462
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
please tell us.

463
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,680
Then, we can prepare in advance.

464
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,280
About it...

465
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,640
I...

466
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,920
Lord Lu is here!

467
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,760
Your Highness.

468
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Everyone.

469
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
How are you?

470
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
Last time I met you,

471
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,960
we were also at Sword Manor.

472
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,970
It was the first time
that I talked about Sects Alliance.

473
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,080
Your Highness.

474
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,580
Our Shangqing Sect

475
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,160
never admits Sects Alliance.

476
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,160
Priest Xingyi.

477
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,930
In this martial arts world,

478
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,520
it is because there are old fogeys

479
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,120
like you...

480
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,200
You!

481
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,930
It has stopped the development

482
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,560
and becomes chaotic.

483
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,160
Mr. Lin.

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Do you agree?

485
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,120
Lin Zongxing!

486
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,760
Shame on you!

487
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,160
Last time when you colluded with Lord Lu

488
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,400
and announced Sects Alliance,

489
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,080
I was cheated by you.

490
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,540
I wasn’t serious with you.

491
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,360
I didn’t think

492
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,600
you cheated us here.

493
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,000
Seems that

494
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,040
you have been

495
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
his dog for long!

496
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,760
Abbess Ciren.

497
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,520
Your temper

498
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,120
is still bad.

499
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,080
I remember

500
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
that you helped me

501
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,240
by all means.

502
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,920
So

503
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
why are you so angry now?

504
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,200
Yes.

505
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,280
I wanted to make my Emei Sect stronger

506
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,440
with the power of officials.

507
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,640
But I didn’t think

508
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,560
you would create a Sects Alliance.

509
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,600
This is your trick to control

510
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,320
the whole martial arts world!

511
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,200
Yes.

512
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,460
I want to control the martial arts world.

513
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,520
So what?

514
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Stubborn old people

515
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,720
like you

516
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,840
object to my Sects Alliance.

517
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,340
But what’s the result?

518
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Sand Sect, Kunlun Sect,

519
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Hanjiang Sect and Purple Hawk Sect.

520
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,600
Which one of them wasn’t destroyed?

521
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,380
This is the result when you resist me.

522
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,600
Merciful Buddha.

523
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Why did you destroy the four sects?

524
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,320
Yes.

525
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,480
I asked Xia Qingmei to do it.

526
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,000
So what?

527
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,280
They didn’t appreciate my kindness,

528
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,880
so I killed them.

529
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
They should have known what would happen

530
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,160
if they go against me.

531
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,840
Merciful Buddha.

532
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,800
Lin Zongxing,

533
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,360
you really had a good student.

534
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,500
Qingmei made a huge mistake with Nine Moves.

535
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,320
But he has recognized his wrong doing.

536
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,120
He has known?

537
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,880
Mr. Lin.

538
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,880
It’s related to many lives.

539
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,640
It can’t be offset

540
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
by these words.

541
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,520
Right?

542
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,320
Merciful Buddha.

543
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,640
Merciful Buddha!

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,280
Abbot Shiyan!

545
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,720
I have been confused for a long time.

546
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,640
I wonder

547
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
whether Buddha

548
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,560
can hear

549
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,600
what you say.

550
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,760
Do you think the world can be peaceful

551
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,000
if you pray every day?

552
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,640
It's a big joke!

553
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,040
Merciful Buddha. Merciful Buddha.

554
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,680
As long as there are people,

555
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,640
the world can’t be peaceful.

556
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,480
Because you are

557
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
all greedy.

558
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Even if I don’t make Sects Alliance,

559
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
you will keep fighting

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,640
for your selfish desire.

561
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,280
When

562
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Nine Moves appeared,

563
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,760
you fought fiercely to get it,

564
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
like hungry dogs

565
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,000
fight for bones.

566
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,040
What an ugly scene!

567
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,720
Do you think you are innocent?

568
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
You didn’t do any bad thing?

569
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,640
But don’t worry.

570
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
If you support me

571
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,880
to create Sects Alliance,

572
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,360
I promise

573
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,540
that there won’t be slaughter

574
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,560
in the martial arts world.

575
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,760
Xia Qingmei lost his mind.

576
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,160
I asked the Leader of Hall of Flames,

577
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,160
Yuwen Muyuan, to kill him.

578
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,000
This is to remind others.

579
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,160
The Leader of Hall of Flames?

580
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,240
When did Yuwen Muyuan become the Leader?

581
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,880
Did you title him

582
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,480
on the so-called induction ceremony?

583
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,560
The ceremony is

584
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
not important.

585
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,720
What is important is

586
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,640
that I titled him.

587
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,880
It’s like

588
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,490
the Sects Alliance must be created

589
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,480
since I said it.

590
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,120
You...

591
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,240
There’s knockout drop in the tea.

592
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
Lin Zongxing.

593
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,660
You are respected by many people.

594
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,560
How come you did such a shameless thing?

595
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,560
Abbess Ciren.

596
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
Listen,

597
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
don’t blame Mr. Lin.

598
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
His daughter Lin Fengzi is imprisoned by me.

599
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,320
He must

600
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,480
listen to me.

601
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,320
Immoral!

602
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,880
Shameless!

603
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,360
Xue Lie...

604
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,360
What...

605
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
What on earth do you want?

606
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,200
I don’t want to make enemies.

607
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,880
But

608
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,320
you so-called heroes

609
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,040
of martial arts world

610
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
don’t know my ambition.

611
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,720
So,

612
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,040
I announce that Sects Alliance is created now.

613
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,800
Tell me,

614
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,880
how do you choose?

615
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,190
No way!

616
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,080
I wanted to

617
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,480
make the Sects Alliance well

618
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,360
with you.

619
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
But you don’t appreciate my kindness.

620
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,360
So,

621
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,800
it’s better that I

622
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,040
clean the martial arts world completely.

623
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,710
No one will bother me.

624
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,000
Xue Lie.

625
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
You promised

626
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
not to hurt innocent people!

627
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,560
Mr. Lin, you are still sober?

628
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,520
You...

629
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,000
Mr. Lin.

630
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,360
What?

631
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
Do you think

632
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,320
I will only leave you?

633
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
All of you

634
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,680
are with powerful martial arts.

635
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,840
But

636
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,040
I don’t know martial arts at all.

637
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
If anyone of you

638
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,880
gets away with it

639
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
and attempts revenge in the future,

640
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,360
what should I do?

641
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,680
I am not that stupid.

642
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,040
I’ll kill all of you here.

643
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,280
I’ll ruin the thing

644
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
that I can’t get.

645
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,120
So, not one of you

646
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
can escape from here

647
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,880
today.

648
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,040
It’s not easy

649
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,680
to kill us!

650
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,500
Don’t move!

651
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,760
Abbess,

652
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
I forgot to tell you.

653
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,320
If you use martial arts,

654
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,600
the efficacy of the knockout drop

655
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,720
will attack more.

656
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,760
And then, it will be harder

657
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,360
to kill me.

658
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,880
I’m afraid you can’t

659
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,560
even hurt my finger.

660
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
It’s our fault.

661
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,290
We should have listened to Master Shangguan.

662
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,560
But we believed in luck.

663
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,540
Otherwise,

664
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,720
we wouldn’t have ended up like this.

665
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,000
How come you still hope

666
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,360
Shangguan Tou will come to save you?

667
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,000
Stop dreaming.

668
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,320
I killed him with explosives.

669
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
You can’t even find his body.

670
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,160
And Chong Xuezhi.

671
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,040
You hate her the most.

672
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,810
You said that she’s a demoness
who brings disasters.

673
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,040
The poor couple

674
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,920
wanted to come here to stop me.

675
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,040
But

676
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,760
they were trapped by me.

677
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,760
Don’t worry.

678
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,760
Calm down.

679
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,520
You will go to see them soon.

680
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
I’ve

681
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,080
buried Black Fires

682
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,320
around the whole Sword Manor.

683
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
So,

684
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,640
calm down

685
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,000
and cherish

686
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,000
your last moments

687
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,180
Close the door.

688
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,800
Let us out.

689
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,920
Aren’t you martial artists?

690
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
Don’t you think you are great?

691
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
But you are poor like beggars!

692
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
You are all arrogant

693
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,920
with some martial arts.

694
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,920
I’ll kill all of you!

695
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,400
I tell you.

696
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Though I don’t know martial arts,

697
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,160
I can still control lives!

698
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,440
I never did

699
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,240
bad things in my life,

700
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,610
but I can’t believe that

701
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,650
I become the sinner
of the martial arts world now.

702
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,680
Stop struggling.

703
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,560
You will

704
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,840
go to hell soon.

705
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,800
Your Highness.

706
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,560
It’s ready.

707
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,610
Protect Lord Lu!

708
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,760
Go!

709
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,840
Chong Xuezhi.

710
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,360
Shangguan Tou.

711
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,920
Chong Xuezhi.

712
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,240
You...

713
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,720
I’m afraid

714
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,680
that I’ll let you down again.

715
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,280
Xue Lie.

716
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,700
Your Warriors in Black are great,

717
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,880
but it’s not hard to defeat them

718
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,820
if they are not in a matrix.

719
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,540
Shangguan Tou,

720
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
will you attempt to assassinate

721
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,640
Lord Lu again?

722
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,000
Xue Lie,

723
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,940
I won’t kill you today.

724
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,880
But you must

725
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,680
admit your sins.

726
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Shangguan Tou,

727
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,840
you are really lucky.

728
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,240
I can’t believe that

729
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,440
you are still alive.

730
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Your plan is perfect.

731
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,960
I would come immediately

732
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,000
once I found out what would happen here.

733
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,120
But you were afraid that I might not come.

734
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,480
So, you sent me a letter.

735
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,100
But I discovered your mistake

736
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,520
in your letter.

737
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,040
What mistake?

738
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,810
After I fell from the cliff,

739
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,680
I was living in Winehouse of Fairyland

740
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,210
under the name of Yu Chuzhi.

741
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Hongxiu knows it.

742
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,680
She does everything carefully.

743
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,480
So if this letter was from her,

744
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
she would write

745
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,040
“To Mr. Yu”,

746
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,960
not “Master Shangguan”.

747
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,200
Are you Master Shangguan?

748
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,760
Yes.

749
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,020
What’s the matter?

750
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,650
Here’s a letter for you.

751
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,220
[To Master Shangguan]

752
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,840
Also,

753
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,200
if Hongxiu really wrote a letter for me,

754
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,400
she would stop us

755
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,200
from going to Sword Manor.

756
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,000
Because she doesn’t want us

757
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,160
to be in danger.

758
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,840
My carelessness

759
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,920
saved you.

760
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,560
But I remind you.

761
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,040
Lin Fengzi is in my hand.

762
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Aren’t you afraid

763
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,140
that I’ll kill her?

764
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,360
Xue Lie.

765
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,840
Do you think we have no options?

766
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,800
After Tou determined that the letter was fake,

767
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,000
we guessed that it’s your trick

768
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,890
to call them to Sword Manor.

769
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,960
As we expected,

770
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,560
you kidnapped Fengzi

771
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,100
and threatened Mr. Lin

772
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
to gather the leaders here.

773
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,600
I’ll tell you what happened.

774
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
After you left,

775
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Chequ and Zhusha went your mansion secretly.

776
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,300
They helped Fengzi to escape.

777
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,680
But I should say “thanks” to you.

778
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,920
You didn’t hurt her,

779
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,080
You took good care of her and her baby.

780
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,640
When Fengzi left your mansion,

781
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,180
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

782
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,480
she was much better than before.

783
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
I regret that

784
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,640
I should have killed her.

785
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,440
Xue Lie.

786
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,720
You spread the disease,

787
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,760
sealed up Hall of Flames,

788
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,740
framed the Imperial Advisor,

789
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,920
made Xia Qingmei lose his mind,

790
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,760
slaughtered Sand Sect, Kunlun Sect,

791
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,640
Hanjiang Sect and Purple Hawk Sect,

792
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,240
and now,

793
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,240
you want to laughter
the whole martial arts world.

794
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,500
What do you have to say?

795
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,640
I

796
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,240
slaughtered those sects?

797
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Xia Qingmei did it.

798
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,320
But Xia Qingmei was killed by Yuwen Muyuan.

799
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,960
I erased an evil for martial arts world.

800
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,050
Don’t you agree?

801
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,120
Xue Lie.

802
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,240
Isn’t it enough that you killed Muyuan?

803
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,320
Must you also destroy his reputation?
