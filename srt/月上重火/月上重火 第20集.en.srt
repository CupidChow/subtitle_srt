00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 20

4
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Father.

5
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,720
Fengzi, what brings you here?

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
What’s wrong?

7
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,840
Feeling unwell?

8
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,829
I’ll find a doctor.

9
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,550
I’m fine.

10
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,910
Father.

11
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,320
I’ve had an answer

12
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,950
for the thing we talked about last time.

13
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
What do you mean?

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,920
It’s that…

15
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,180
I’m willing to marry Qingmei.

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,470
Great!

17
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,470
Fantastic!

18
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
“Looking far to the southeast.”

19
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,640
“Playing the melody for the phoenix. ”

20
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,670
“I cannot forget

21
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
that beauty. ”

22
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,390
“One day apart,

23
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,480
I would be missing her like crazy. ”

24
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,000
Tou.

25
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:45,110
Are you expressing love through the melody?

26
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,640
Please forgive me, Mr. Lin.

27
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,070
In your melody,

28
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,650
I feel your impatience.

29
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,670
It’s still not comparable to

30
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,550
what Xuezhi’s father played.

31
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,550
My skills are superficial.

32
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,720
I would never be comparable to him.

33
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,760
Mr. Lin,

34
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,550
did you see anything

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in your journey outside the Valley?

36
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,550
Don’t even mention that.

37
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,270
If it weren’t for making room for you,

38
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,400
I wouldn’t walk around in my old bones.

39
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,170
How are you?

40
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,950
How’s your recovery?

41
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,980
I’ve almost fully recovered.

42
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,040
The Lotus Sutra works well.

43
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,450
After the practice,

44
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,920
my inner power has been improved quickly.

45
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,200
More than that, I feel

46
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,670
power is growing in my body

47
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,350
during these days.

48
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,230
The Sutra is indeed unfathomable.

49
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
I’m just about to know half of it.

50
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,950
When we three created

51
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,409
the Lotus Sutra that year,

52
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,600
we hid some secrets in it.

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,130
Secrets?

54
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,159
It has a reason for the Lotus Wing

55
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,750
to be the top manual in the world.

56
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,440
The Lotus Sutra

57
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,000
is far more complicated than you expected.

58
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,680
The Nine Moves belongs to yang,

59
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,620
while the Lotus Sutra yin.

60
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,160
The Sutra could assist your practice of Nine Moves

61
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,010
and improve your inner power.

62
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,350
But it has more functions than that.

63
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,920
But I hope

64
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,510
you would never use those in your whole life.

65
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,670
Other functions?

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,050
Didn’t Xuezhi tell you?

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
No.

68
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,440
But…

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,550
It’s Xuezhi

70
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,880
who made this possible.

71
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,070
I will surely

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,790
remember her favor.

73
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,390
This is destined for you two.

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,260
You can cherish what you have.

75
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,640
I see.

76
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,070
But…

77
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,690
You don’t want her to leave?

78
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,350
I’ve known that already.

79
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,900
Your melody was hasty.

80
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,380
Something was bothering your heart.

81
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,040
Now that you’ve recovered,

82
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Xuezhi should return to the Hall.

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,720
You know that

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,830
she’s impetuous.

85
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,360
You can’t force her to stay.

86
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,720
I know what you mean.

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,200
She has her own tasks.

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,890
How can I hinder her?

89
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,010
I will only try to protect her.

90
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,230
But,

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,950
she’ll set off tomorrow.

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,550
It’s so hasty?

93
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,660
It seems that I came at the wrong time.

94
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,490
Not exactly.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,440
I have something to ask you.

96
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Mr. Lin.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,930
You are Xuezhi’s uncle.

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,880
I have to ask your permission.

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,550
Please.

100
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
I’m planning

101
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,510
to take Xuezhi to my father recently.

102
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,510
So, I want your permission.

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,540
I’m serious about the relationship.

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
Now that you like each other,

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
you can do as you said.

106
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,640
You know each other well.

107
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,240
Since you have made the step,

108
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,950
don’t disappoint her.

109
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,270
Thank you.

110
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Uncle.

111
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,230
You came back.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,790
Where have you been these days?

113
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,160
Me?

114
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,890
It’s time to take the medicine.

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,670
You two are so sweet here.

116
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,070
It’s inappropriate for an old man like me

117
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,480
to stand here.

118
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,720
Uncle.

119
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,000
I came here

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,830
especially for you.

121
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,350
Xuezhi,

122
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,010
you’re a honey-mouthed girl.

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,660
Now you can even take care of someone.

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
It’s so considerate.

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,470
Tou.

126
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,720
When will you invite me to your wedding?

127
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,640
Uncle.

128
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,000
Please don’t make fun of me.

129
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,200
Leader.

130
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,370
Leader.

131
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,880
This is an invitation from Sword Manor.

132
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,710
Sword Manor?

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,760
Yeah.

134
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Lin Fengzi is marrying Xia Qingmei.

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,290
Fengzi is getting married?

136
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,120
It’s not a wedding banquet.

137
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,080
But an engagement banquet.

138
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,470
And this invitation

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,910
is sent to Mr. Lin.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,590
Uncle.

141
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,910
Aren’t you going?

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Fengzi’s father is your elder brother.

143
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,520
Fengzi is your niece.

144
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,350
Why don’t you go to

145
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,210
you niece’s engagement banquet?

146
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,030
Because

147
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,790
Mr. Lin and Fengzi’s father

148
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,530
are imperial brothers.

149
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,400
Why?

150
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,520
I don’t look imperial?

151
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,640
No, no.

152
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,790
You are nobler than imperial.

153
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,520
But,

154
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,300
I haven’t heard that from you.

155
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,210
There’s no point in

156
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,750
speaking what’s passed.

157
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
After the new emperor ascended the throne,

158
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,760
we abandoned our imperial identities

159
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,710
and got far away from the court.

160
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,910
We have our own lives.

161
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,840
Why?

162
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,110
We have different pursuits.

163
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,960
Some people are for an official career.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,560
Some people are for freedom.

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,640
Some people drown themselves in sex and pleasure.

166
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,070
Though we were born in the imperial family,

167
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,400
we knew how difficult imperial life was.

168
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,640
He prefers to be connected to the world

169
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,280
while I secluded myself here.

170
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,280
It at least saves our relationship,

171
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,140
and we have reached our own goals.

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
So,

173
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,640
uncle,

174
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
don’t you want to see him?

175
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Although he abandoned his imperial identity,

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,200
the Sword Manor belongs to the world.

177
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,000
If there is an imperial court in the world,

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
he could be someone high up.

179
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,290
He sent out invitations

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,960
to celebrate his daughter’s engagement banquet.

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Those guests are a more mixed bunch.

182
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,810
And I don’t know his intention.

183
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,350
It was not easy for me to

184
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,960
get away from that world.

185
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
Why should I step in that muddy water again?

186
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,230
Also,

187
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,520
there’s an unwritten rule from the court that

188
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,880
two princes cannot see each other.

189
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,910
Yeah.

190
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,110
But,

191
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,550
Leader Lin should know this rule.

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,460
Why did he still send the invitation?

193
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,640
Is it not

194
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,640
from him?

195
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,690
I don’t care.

196
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,030
I won’t go.

197
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,790
Uncle.

198
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,840
You’re not a prince anymore.

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,150
You are biological brothers.

200
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,010
And you both stay out of the court.

201
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,790
Can’t you see each other?

202
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,670
I’m not interested in the mundane world.

203
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,280
I prefer to stay here in the Valley,

204
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,590
and be anonymous.

205
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,150
By the way,

206
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,790
Tou said

207
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,790
you’d set off for the Hall tomorrow.

208
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,520
We should

209
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,030
have a reunion meal.

210
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,790
Okay, I’ll prepare that.

211
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,350
She is getting virtuous.

212
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,960
Miss. Lin.

213
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,550
Father.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,670
Fengzi.

215
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,670
Have you sent

216
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,840
all the invitations?

217
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,110
Yeah, a few days ago.

218
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,030
Right, father.

219
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,890
I also sent one to Uncle Changran.

220
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,280
Why?

221
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,200
Did I do wrong?

222
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,200
No.

223
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,910
I’m afraid that

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
he wouldn’t come.

225
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Why?

226
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,150
Fengzi.

227
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
Did you remember

228
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,440
my identity

229
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,470
before building Sword Manor?

230
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,550
Yeah, sure.

231
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,320
You were both princes.

232
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,710
Although we abandoned our imperial identities,

233
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,170
we were princes after all.

234
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,320
It’s a taboo for us to meet each other.

235
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,960
So,

236
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
he wouldn’t come.

237
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,590
Wouldn’t come?

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,760
Enough about him.

239
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,910
The day is coming.

240
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,110
Don’t be sad.

241
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,910
Come on.

242
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,000
Let’s pick the cloth.

243
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,360
It’s still not decided.

244
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,590
Look.

245
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,210
It seems to be this.

246
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,640
Chief Guardian.

247
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,820
It’s an invitation from Sword Manor.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Sword Manor?

249
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,500
Xia Qingmei and Lin Fengzi are getting married?

250
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
This is for Leader.

251
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,910
But Young Master is still in Moon Valley

252
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,840
and hasn’t come back yet.

253
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,150
Did she say

254
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,430
when she will return?

255
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,400
No.

256
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,440
Then, let me

257
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,520
go there and notify her.

258
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,280
There’s not enough time.

259
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,870
But it’s a disgrace if she doesn’t go there.

260
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,910
Well.

261
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,550
Prepare a lavish gift.

262
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,590
Let’s go there for her.

263
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,840
Okay.

264
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,440
Do you regard this

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,280
as your own home?

266
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
Do you think

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,060
I have disturbed the quietness here?

268
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,000
Did I turn the fairyland

269
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,590
into a marketplace?

270
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,960
You can stay as long as you like.

271
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,030
I hope you can disturb me forever.

272
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,590
Why?

273
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,050
You don’t want me to leave?

274
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,030
I don’t.

275
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,600
I don’t want that either.

276
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,760
But,

277
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,960
I’m the Leader of the Hall.

278
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,800
What are you making?

279
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,030
This

280
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,100
is the medicine I made for you.

281
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,670
“You start to cook

282
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,250
three days after you get married.”

283
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Are you ready to get married?

284
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,520
Who said that?

285
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,110
Xuezhi.

286
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,960
I thought

287
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,640
I didn’t deserve such relationship

288
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,350
for this life.

289
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,910
I used to hide my feelings

290
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,480
for you intentionally,

291
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,920
and stayed away from you.

292
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,350
It’s my bad.

293
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,790
But

294
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,030
since you moved here,

295
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,640
you’ve taught me what sincerity is

296
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,910
and what love is

297
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,300
during the days together.

298
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,780
And you also let me realize

299
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,590
no hardship would

300
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,710
part us

301
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,230
if we can trust each other.

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,880
So,

303
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,000
now I’m ready

304
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,000
to face my feelings.

305
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,870
I won’t marry anyone else

306
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,210
but you in this life.

307
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,690
After you go back

308
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,240
and take care of everything,

309
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,230
I’m planning to take you to

310
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,680
Imperial Advisor’s Mansion

311
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,080
to see my father,

312
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,110
and tell him

313
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,960
I’ve found the only one

314
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,800
in my life.

315
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,310
Xuezhi,

316
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,510
do you want to do that?

317
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,430
Yeah.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,040
Does Herbal Medicine Master know

319
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,490
you are using his pots?

320
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,310
Master.

321
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,430
It’s okay.

322
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:14,830
You!

323
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,560
It’s okay.

324
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,280
Come here.

325
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,680
Calm down.

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,640
-Come here!
-Go now.

327
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,040
You.

328
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,760
Calm down.

329
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,190
Come here.

330
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,680
Master.

331
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,310
Master. Master.

332
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,160
She’s naïve.

333
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,410
I apologize for her.

334
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,430
See you.

335
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,070
You!

336
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,520
Uncle.

337
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,760
Have more.

338
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,470
We’re finally having dinner together.

339
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,000
Why are you down?

340
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,640
People have joys and sorrows

341
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,990
and the moon has waxes and wanes.

342
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,830
Let’s just

343
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,090
drink and forget our sorrows.

344
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,000
What a pity!

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,130
We drank up the wine.

346
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,850
Go ahead eating.

347
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,590
I’ll get a bottle of wine.

348
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,830
Tou.

349
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,470
If

350
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,490
Leader Lin was a prince,

351
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,920
then Fengzi would be a prince’s daughter.

352
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
So what?

353
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,230
She would have no freedom

354
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,470
and be exhausted.

355
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
Don’t drink too much.

356
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,710
It’s bad for your health.

357
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,310
Xuezhi,

358
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,640
Mr. Lin

359
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,830
was a prince before.

360
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,490
If he didn’t abandon his identity,

361
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,220
you would be a prince’s niece.

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,830
Tell me.

363
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,070
If you had another chance,

364
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,710
would you like to be a prince’s niece

365
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,000
or

366
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,260
the Leader of the Hall?

367
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,310
Neither.

368
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,470
What about you?

369
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,070
If you had another chance,

370
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,640
would you like to be the son of Imperial Advisor

371
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
or the Leader of Moon Valley?

372
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,310
I had no choice.

373
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,800
Mr. Lin

374
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,520
was in the court

375
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,580
and he went through the world.

376
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,160
I won’t have such

377
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,280
spirit as him.

378
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,070
Tou.

379
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,920
Whatever you do,

380
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,920
I’ll stay by your side.

381
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,830
Xuezhi,

382
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,070
I have one idea.

383
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,830
If we

384
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,160
have children later,

385
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,980
should we say they’re from

386
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,470
the court

387
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,040
or the world?

388
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,070
What are you talking about?

389
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,040
How about this?

390
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,490
If it’s a daughter,

391
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,880
she would do embroidery at Moon Valley.

392
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,070
If it’s a boy,

393
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,330
he would make weapons at the Hall.

394
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,280
No.

395
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,210
That’s not fair.

396
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,760
It’s not fair to our son.

397
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,540
You’re being partial.

398
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
Whose son will make weapons?

399
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,560
Mr. Lin.

400
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,280
Xuezhi doesn’t want

401
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,470
our son to make weapons at the Hall.

402
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,890
She’s nagging about it.

403
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Tou!

404
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,920
This was buried by me

405
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,000
under the tree

406
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,860
when I came to Moon Valley.

407
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,310
Since we’re having dinner together,

408
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,680
let’s taste the good stuff.

409
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,350
Good.

410
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,310
Here.

411
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,290
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

412
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,590
Here.

413
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,590
Thank you, uncle.

414
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,000
Here.

415
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,350
Cheers.

416
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,280
Good wine.

417
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,040
Good wine.

418
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,430
Good wine

419
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,760
is like true affection.

420
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,720
The longer it stays,

421
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,640
the stronger it tastes.

422
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,150
The more carefully you taste it,

423
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
the more endless the aftertaste is.

424
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
I just want to say that

425
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,350
if you can’t leave each other,

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,470
then don’t.

427
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,310
Do you have any idea?

428
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,190
Go to Sword Manor

429
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,520
for the engagement banquet.

430
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,920
But,

431
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,520
you said…

432
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,830
Not me.

433
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,190
You two.

434
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,160
I’m afraid it’s not proper.

435
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,190
She has to go back to the Hall.

436
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,560
I…

437
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,420
I didn’t receive any invitation.

438
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,900
I thought about it for a long time.

439
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
He invited so many people

440
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,070
this time.

441
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,880
It seems irrational.

442
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,780
Think about it.

443
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,470
The Lotus Wing has rattled the world.

444
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,350
How would he invite so many people

445
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,680
in the world at such time

446
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,830
to just have an engagement banquet?

447
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,210
What’s his intention?

448
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,560
I have no clue.

449
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,520
Tou.

450
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,410
Sword Manor is close to Dongdu.

451
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,230
It’s perfect that

452
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,760
you can maintain the order.

453
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,880
Good.

454
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,590
Then,

455
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,880
I’ll go alone.

456
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,840
Xuezhi will go back to the Hall.

457
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,280
What if there’s danger…

458
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,350
Muyuan is at the Hall.

459
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,350
We can temporarily

460
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,560
drop that.

461
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,680
If there’s any special intention

462
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,950
behind this,

463
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,110
I’m afraid

464
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,160
only Xuezhi could force it out.

465
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,830
Do you mean

466
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,090
Xuezhi will be the bait?

467
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,640
Definitely no.

468
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,520
How could I?

469
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
Then you mean?

470
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,070
If there’s no closure to it,

471
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,730
Xuezhi wouldn’t regain her peace.

472
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,040
Now that Sword Manor made a big move

473
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,760
and even I got the invitation,

474
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,110
I believe everyone else got it too.

475
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,930
The one who wants to get the manual

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
has to get it in a chaotic situation.

477
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,970
Let’s just follow their move,

478
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,400
get close to them,

479
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,210
and identify who it is.

480
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,230
Uncle.

481
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,590
You mean…

482
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,190
You are the big boss.

483
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,670
Whether you can get a big fish

484
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
depends on you now.

485
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,280
What if he didn’t appear?

486
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,280
Doesn’t matter.

487
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,920
The worst result is that you went there in vain.

488
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,310
Even if she doesn’t replace me,

489
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,070
she is the Leader of the Hall.

490
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,160
She has every right to be there.

491
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,710
My elder brother is straightforward and explicit.

492
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,240
He is upright and integral.

493
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
Even if we can’t see that man,

494
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,920
this journey to Sword Manor

495
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,120
deserves an attempt.

496
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,000
Let’s just say,

497
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,830
if the Hall had any trouble in the future,

498
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,230
I’m afraid Sword Manor

499
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,070
will be the only backup for you

500
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,590
in the whole world.

501
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,310
I want to do it.

502
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,810
What about you?

503
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
Since she has agreed to do it,

504
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,710
I’ll

505
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,760
go with her.

506
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,280
Okay.

507
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,590
This journey has multiple reasons.

508
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,250
The first is to set out the bait

509
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
and resolve the danger of Lotus Wing.

510
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,710
The second is to conciliate Dongdu

511
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,370
and celebrate for my brother.

512
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,280
Thirdly.

513
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,830
it’s for the path

514
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,950
you will step on in the future.

515
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,000
So, you can stand

516
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,500
and face the hardships together.

517
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,640
There’s one thing you left.

518
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,830
Fourthly,

519
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,230
it’s to set a date

520
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,800
to marry Xuezhi

521
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,110
and take her to my father.

522
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,640
Great!

523
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,950
You’ve

524
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,080
become smarter now.

525
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,920
Come on.

526
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,310
Let’s toast.

527
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,590
Come on.

528
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,350
Tou.

529
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,140
Now that Xuezhi is absent,

530
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,400
you can tell me

531
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,200
your worries.

532
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,190
Mr. Lin.

533
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,070
You have keen eyes.

534
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,760
Actually,

535
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,470
I was brought up

536
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,400
in Sword Manor.

537
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,070
It was near Sword Manor where I saved you.

538
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I believe there’s a reason for that.

539
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,250
It had happened for many years,

540
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,460
and I don’t want to bring it up.

541
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,760
And…

542
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,520
Never mind.

543
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,930
Everyone has a past.

544
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,880
If you don’t want to talk about it,

545
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,160
I won’t force you.

546
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,880
But if it’s concerned with Xuezhi,

547
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,760
I need to remind you.

548
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,930
A clear brook is deep and shallow.

549
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,060
A couple is close and strange.

550
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,930
Sometimes, there may be another story

551
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,350
when we can straighten it out in one sentence.

552
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,210
You’d better avoid suspicion in the relationship.

553
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,160
What really hurts

554
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,310
cannot be sealed.

555
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,640
Instead of waiting the other one to be honest,

556
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,000
you’d better take the initiative to be honest.

557
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
You’ll stay together longer

558
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,240
if you are of one heart and one mind.

559
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,970
Rest assured, Mr. Lin.

560
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
Although I had unpleasantness,

561
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,710
I would

562
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,520
go to Sword Manor

563
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,110
with Xuezhi.

564
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,710
The journey ahead is still to be explored.

565
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,590
I wouldn’t see her go there alone.

566
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,640
You always be true to your words.

567
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,100
I don’t need to be worried.

568
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,540
There are ins and outs,

569
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,230
beginning and end.

570
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,380
If we can understand that,

571
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,860
we’ll know the nature of everything.

572
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,130
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

573
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,160
I can see you’re getting distracted.

574
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,950
I’m sorry, Mister.

575
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,770
I can’t walk away from that now.

576
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,590
Your emotion

577
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,470
has been unstable for this month.

578
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,040
There’s nearly no progress in your martial arts.

579
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,370
Although you have time,

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
I don’t!

581
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:02,690
Mister.

582
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,680
Please give me more time.

583
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,950
After I’m done with the engagement banquet,

584
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,400
I’ll keep practicing.

585
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,160
What?

586
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
Engagement banquet?

587
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
You’re getting married?

588
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,590
Yeah.

589
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,560
To my junior fellow,

590
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,590
Lin Fengzi.

591
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,190
Go away.

592
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,060
I won’t teach you the Nine Moves anymore.

593
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,000
Master.

594
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,230
What do you mean?

595
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,000
Anyone who practices this

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,310
has to end feelings and desires.

597
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,470
Let alone being sentimental.

598
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,490
What do you think you are practicing?

599
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,950
It’s the top martial arts in the world.

600
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,760
Once you reach the peak move,

601
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,400
you can

602
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,690
control everything and defeat millions of enemies.

603
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,230
What should be forbidden

604
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,710
is impurity in mind.

605
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,070
The thing

606
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,120
you are thinking about in your head

607
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,160
is all about those dirty business.

608
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,590
I don’t think

609
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,560
you can practice it.

610
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
Why?

611
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,160
Is it because

612
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,560
I can’t do it

613
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,190
after I get married?

614
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,760
Or is it because

615
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,800
you’ll have no chance to do that if I make it?

616
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,530
So, you force me to practice it.

617
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,680
The reason why I taught you Nine Moves

618
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,230
was because

619
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,680
you were determined and wholehearted for it.

620
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,640
I hoped

621
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you could achieve something and unite the world,

622
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,330
so you could realize my unfinished dream.

623
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Now I see

624
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,680
you’re the wrong guy.

625
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,030
I was obsessed with martial arts

626
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,950
when I was at the Hall.

627
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,970
I’ve always been

628
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,110
yearning for the Nine Moves.

629
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,560
Later,

630
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,930
I was kicked out of the Hall.

631
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,710
In order to practice the Nine Moves,

632
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,590
I was willing to be a monk.

633
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,770
Do you think practicing martial arts depends on talent?

634
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,830
It depends on

635
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,110
obsession.

636
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
A quitter

637
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,880
like you

638
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,710
will never practice it well.

639
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,140
I will get married no matter what.

640
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,630
The reason I practiced it

641
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,470
is that I want to win Fengzi’s favor.

642
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,660
Compared with practicing it,

643
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,200
it’s more important to be with Fengzi.

644
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,710
Chong Ye

645
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,110
was obsessed with martial arts,

646
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,830
so he ended up like that.

647
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,710
What I want

648
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
is invincible capacity

649
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,400
instead of becoming a crazy man

650
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,520
in order to practice the top martial arts.

651
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,590
Xia Qingmei,

652
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,880
think about it.

653
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,040
Do you want to be

654
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,800
a minor one in this world

655
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,950
just to indulge yourself in love?

656
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,190
Haven’t you had enough about

657
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,280
being inferior to others

658
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,710
in Sword Manor?

659
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,050
Being together with Fengzi

660
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,470
and getting by

661
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,710
is better than going astray.

662
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,650
Xia Qingmei!

663
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,580
[Sword Manor]

664
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,430
Master.

665
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,470
Master.

666
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,620
There are so many people outside.

667
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,070
Sure.

668
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,800
Sword Manor

669
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,590
is the top school in the world.

670
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,760
And today

671
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,950
is the engagement banquet of the Leader’s daughter.

672
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,830
Surely, we have guests from all over the world.

673
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,190
But I don’t know

674
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,430
these people.

675
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,560
This is the world.

676
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,830
You can’t control everything.

677
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
Superficial friends

678
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,550
are not necessarily your real friends.

679
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,230
Fengzi.

680
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,000
This is the happiest day of a girl’s life.

681
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,070
Don’t be nervous.

682
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,230
I’m not.

683
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,270
To tell you the truth,

684
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,040
master,

685
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,470
I grew up with Qingmei.

686
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,930
We’ve been familiar

687
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,080
for all these years.

688
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,800
You’re still a little girl.

689
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,060
You don’t understand.

690
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,560
A girl before marriage

691
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,940
and after marriage

692
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,880
is totally different.

693
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,360
How do you know that, master?

694
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,000
Well.

695
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,950
Stay here.

696
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,520
I’ll leave now.

697
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,350
Congratulations.

698
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,520
Thank you.

699
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,850
Abbess Ciren, this way.

700
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,520
Priest Xingyi.

701
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,830
Long time no see.

702
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,470
-Let’s drink later.
-Congratulations!

703
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,530
Congratulations.

704
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,350
Congratulations.

705
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,350
Leader Qiu.

706
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,880
Long time no see.

707
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,230
-Leader Lin.
-Please have a seat.

708
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,960
Congratulations, Leader Lin.

709
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,110
Leader Feng.

710
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,840
Congratulations, Leader Lin.

711
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,429
Your disciple and daughter are getting engaged.

712
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,600
Two happy events come at the same time.

713
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,469
I wish that

714
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,949
they’ll have the best fortune

715
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,280
and deliver a baby soon.

716
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,100
Thank you for your good wishes.

717
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:25,020
[Sword Manor]

718
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,620
Congratulations.

719
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,630
Here.

720
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,179
[Sword Manor]

721
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,449
Please come inside.

722
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,760
One, two,

723
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,949
three, four.

724
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,710
Tou.

725
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,190
What’s wrong?

726
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,429
Nothing.

727
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,710
Let’s go.

728
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,989
Leader Chong.

729
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
Welcome.

730
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,190
Mr. Xia.

731
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,250
Congratulations.

732
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,490
Shangguan Tou?

733
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,330
Today’s the engagement banquet of Fengzi and me.

734
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,940
Are you sure you should come here?

735
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,150
Congratulations.

736
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:10,080
I came here to send my congratulations

737
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,760
because it’s your banquet.

738
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,560
So you came here as?

739
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,850
As the Leader of Moon Valley

740
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,910
or

741
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,760
our senior fellow?

742
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,230
I came here

743
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,040
on behalf of Mr. Lin Changran

744
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,280
to celebrate your engagement.

745
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,450
Congratulations.

746
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,600
Please come inside.

747
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,000
Master Chong.

748
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,650
My master has prepared a wing room for you.

749
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,690
Please take a rest inside.

750
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,490
Congratulations.

751
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,710
Tou.

752
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,860
Drink some tea.

753
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,470
Tou,

754
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,190
why did Mr. Xia

755
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,650
call you senior fellow?

756
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
Why’s that?

757
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,800
Because

758
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,000
I used to study in Sword Manor.

759
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
Lin Zongxing used

760
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,320
to be my master.

761
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,460
I haven’t heard that from you.

762
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,190
Well,

763
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,120
why did you leave?

764
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Because

765
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,670
some bad things happened.

766
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,910
I wondered why you

767
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,190
gave way to Xia Qingmei on Hero Assembly.

768
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,190
Or he wouldn’t become the champion.

769
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,530
Okay, I’ll leave you talk then.

770
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,760
Abbess.

771
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,280
Master.

772
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Long time no see.

773
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,040
Long time no see.

774
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,080
Yeah.

775
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,760
Master.

776
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,320
How’s it?

777
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,950
The Master of the Hall,

778
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,150
Chong Xuezhi is here.

779
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,090
The one with her is Shangguan Tou.

780
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,470
Shangguan Tou?

781
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,080
Why did he come here?

782
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,670
He said he came here

783
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,330
on behalf of Mr. Lin Changran.

784
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,840
I don’t know either

785
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,320
why they are together.

786
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,800
But since they’re together like that,

787
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,120
it seems like…

788
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,710
I see.

789
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,430
Do as usual.

790
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,950
Cheng.

791
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,010
Shuangshuang.

792
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,360
Why are you here?

793
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,710
I saw

794
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,760
Chong Xuezhi and Shangguan Tou are here.

795
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,360
I’m looking for you for that.

796
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,320
They are too close.

797
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,230
Shangguan Tou is the Leader of Moon Valley

798
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,630
and the son of Imperial Advisor.

799
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,230
He has backup from the court.

800
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,320
Are you worried that

801
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,120
Shangguan may hinder your plan against the Hall?

802
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Hadn’t it been for him,

803
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,060
I would have got rid of Chong Xuezhi already.

804
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,840
Now,

805
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,870
she has reached

806
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,470
the fifth move of Lotus Wing.

807
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,280
I’m afraid she

808
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,000
is above me now.

809
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,960
If Shangguan Tou is on her side,

810
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,800
when can I

811
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,870
achieve my revenge?

812
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,620
Do you have any idea

813
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,950
to divide them?

814
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,670
Well.

815
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,080
I’ll try.

816
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,910
Congratulations.

817
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,710
How have you been?

818
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,600
Great.

819
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,190
Please.

820
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,710
Okay.

821
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,950
Suit yourself.

822
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,800
There will be a feast on the evening.

823
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,360
Good.

824
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,080
Xuezhi.

825
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,080
Uncle Lin.

826
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,080
Let’s go.

827
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,560
Please.

828
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,290
You’re here.

829
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,040
Congratulations, uncle Lin.

830
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,870
I came here specially

831
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,910
to congratulate Fengzi and Mr. Xia

832
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,520
because I heard they’re getting engaged.

833
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,430
Heard?

834
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,860
Why? Didn’t you receive the invitation?

835
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,230
I was at the Moon Valley,

836
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,320
visiting uncle Lin

837
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,590
when I received the news.

838
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,080
So,

839
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,470
you brought Shangguan Tou here?

840
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,000
Xuezhi.

841
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,530
You father is my old acquaintance.

842
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,910
I have deep connection with the Hall.

843
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,520
As your uncle, I have to remind you that

844
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,760
you haven’t known him for long.

845
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,430
So I guess you don’t know the real him.

846
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,360
Don’t get confused by his outlook.

847
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,840
Uncle Lin.

848
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,950
Although I haven’t know him for long,

849
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,360
it’s more than a year now.

850
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,000
I know Master Shangguan.

851
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,390
He’s an upright man

852
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,190
and he saved me several times.

853
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,560
Nonsense.

854
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,040
You have to remember

855
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,000
you’re the Master of the Hall,

856
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,230
while he is just a

857
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,670
duplicitous playboy.

858
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,390
I don’t want to see you together with him.

859
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,390
Uncle Lin.

860
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,320
Xuezhi.

861
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,040
I’m sorry.

862
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,340
My words are sharp.

863
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,040
You’re too naïve

864
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,600
and you don’t know much about the world.

865
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,560
I fear that he would coax you.

866
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,280
Master.

867
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,950
Fengzi.

868
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,130
Have a seat.

869
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,080
Why? Master?

870
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,730
Shangguan Tou is here.

871
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,230
He’s here?

872
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,390
Where is he? I want to see him.

873
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:20,950
Don’t be hasty.

874
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,670
He’s not alone.

875
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,150
Who’s with him?

876
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,470
Chong Xuezhi.

877
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,870
Good.

878
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,280
I’ll go see them.

879
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,950
They were close

880
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,170
when they came here.

881
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,150
Their relationship is not normal.

882
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,630
It looks like they are lovers.

883
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,800
No way.

884
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,950
You’re still a naïve child.

885
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,670
Chong Xuezhi is a witch.

886
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,760
It’s easy for her

887
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,470
to attract Shangguan Tou.

888
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,000
I’m afraid that

889
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,000
Shangguan Tou will be tricked.

890
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,800
Then we definitely should go check out.

891
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,600
Fengzi.

892
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,800
I have a question.

893
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,560
You have to be honest.

894
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,670
You can’t forget him completely, right?

895
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,320
I…

896
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,000
Little girl,

897
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,670
you’re too true and innocent.

898
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,190
If you can’t forget him,

899
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,800
then go for it.

900
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,360
But master,

901
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,080
Qingmei and I

902
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,430
are getting engaged…

903
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,630
As long as you are not officially married,

904
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,230
you still have a chance.

905
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,360
Fengzi.

906
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,550
A girl only has one chance

907
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,230
for the life.

908
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,600
If you miss it,

909
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,560
you will regret it.
