[English subtitles are available.]

00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love


3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 22


4
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,079
Found it.


5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,030
April, 21st, the third Year during the reign of Emperor Jianping.


6
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,110
Huashan Sect again.


7
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,390
Muyuan, look.


8
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,800
Three years ago, Huashan Sect.


9
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,440
Leader,


10
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,670
I think Huashan Sect is


11
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,110
testing the water this time.


12
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,390
I’m worried that


13
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,030
they won’t leave it at that.


14
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,079
Then we’ll take the initiative.


15
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
We’ll take the initiative?


16
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,110
When my dad was alive,


17
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,670
the Hall of Flames didn’t fear


18
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,910
the provocation from any sect.


19
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,079
We’ll prove to them


20
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,600
that we still don’t.


21
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,800
Muyuan.


22
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,320
It’s a tough journey.


23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,750
Be careful.


24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,829
Leader.


25
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:56,720
elder in chief.


26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
Rest assured.


27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,520
I’ll be back


28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,390
as soon as my job gets done


29
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,440
in Huashan.


30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,800
Do you honestly not need


31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,830
to take more people with you?


32
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,030
Feng Cheng, the master of Huashan Sect,
is a cunning fellow.


33
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,910
I’m worried that you’ll fall into his trick.


34
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,520
Grandpa,


35
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
the more people he takes,


36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,030
the more complicated it gets.


37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
Don’t worry.


38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,270
I’ll be really quick.


39
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,750
Chief Guardian.


40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,720
You came right in time.


41
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,079
I’m going to Huashan.


42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,190
While I’m away,


43
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
you mustn’t slack off.


44
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,750
Chief Guardian,


45
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,440
this is why we’re here.


46
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,550
Don’t go to Huashan.


47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,960
Chequ and I can go there instead of you.


48
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,720
Don’t mess about.


49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,030
This isn’t a petty matter.


50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,829
We aren’t messing about.


51
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,960
We’ve heard all about it.


52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,829
The mission is to


53
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,470
send the evidence to Huashan


54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,240
to intimidate Feng Cheng.


55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,320
Since it’s just a delivery job,


56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,910
why do you have to do this?


57
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,960
Yes. Chief Guardian,


58
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,550
the Hall of Flames is now in danger.


59
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,630
You’re needed here.


60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Muyuan.


61
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,320
What Zhusha and Chequ said


62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,240
makes sense.


63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,750
Now that I think about it,


64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,270
it is too demeaning for you


65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
to go there in person.


66
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,880
We


67
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,390
might as well send Zhusha and Chequ there


68
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,470
as an experience to learn more stuff.


69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Leader.


70
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,600
This thing...


71
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,520
Chief Guardian,


72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
just let us go.


73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,470
Don’t worry about it.


74
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,510
Fine.


75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,880
You two


76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,950
must be extra careful.


77
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,230
-Yes.
-Yes.


78
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,070
Please enjoy.


79
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,880
Master.


80
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,350
Please enjoy.


81
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,320
Why are you drinking


82
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,480
in the middle of the day?


83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Just because of


84
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,720
one misunderstanding,


85
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,040
she didn’t show up


86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,159
after we waited for the whole night.


87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,270
It looks like


88
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,159
she’s made up her mind.


89
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,350
I, however, think


90
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,320
she doesn’t think it’s true.


91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Then why


92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,159
hasn’t she shown up yet?


93
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,000
What upsets her is that


94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I didn’t tell this thing to her.


95
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,510
In fact,


96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,880
you’ve waited the whole night already.


97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,510
If we wait a while longer,


98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,830
she might


99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,830
show up.


100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,110
The Chief Guardian has been


101
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,600
watching me in the dark for the whole night.


102
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,040
If I’m gone,


103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,720
he’ll have some time to rest.


104
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,350
Why is


105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,670
the Chief Guardian so nosy?


106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,510
Master.


107
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,880
I don’t see you relaxing yourself often.


108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
Are you making the rounds


109
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,230
in disguise?


110
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,880
You again?


111
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,160
I...


112
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,390
Hey, listen to this.


113
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,640
I was doing a small business


114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
the other day.


115
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
There’re quite a number of benefits


116
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,390
in the business.


117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,880
A few days ago...


118
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,390
You mean this?


119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,070
Very generous of you, Master Shangguan.


120
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,760
I’ll keep the favor


121
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,640
and the money in mind.


122
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
If you need me someday,


123
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,640
just tell me.


124
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,159
See you.


125
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,200
Why did you give


126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,070
him the money?


127
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,160
He’ll come in handy someday.


128
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,600
Come on, master.


129
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Cheers.


130
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait.


131
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,270
My lady,


132
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,950
what’s the matter?


133
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,350
Do you know where


134
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,320
Qingmei is?


135
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,070
He went out


136
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,070
early in the morning.


137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,760
But I don’t know


138
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,670
what he went out for.


139
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,830
Master,


140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
where will we go next?


141
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,110
Back to Moon Valley.


142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Tell everything happened during the trip


143
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,640
to Mr. Lin.


144
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,040
To make sure he’s informed.


145
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,950
Master Shangguan.


146
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,070
Master Shangguan.


147
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,070
Where are you going?


148
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,200
How about I tag along?


149
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,510
You spent all the money I gave you?


150
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,340
[Huashan Sect]


151
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,920
Guardian Chequ and Zhusha from
the Hall of Flames


152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,040
are here to greet you, Chief Feng.


153
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,510
You’ve traveled one hundred miles.


154
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
You must be exhausted,


155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,390
after this long journey.


156
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,270
No.


157
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,270
The scenery on the way was nice.


158
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,350
I can tell that you discipline your sect
quite strictly,


159
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,110
Chief Feng.


160
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,230
You must have traveled all the way


161
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,270
here with a purpose.


162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
Tell me, what is it?


163
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,270
We’re here to give you back


164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,320
the stuff that you left


165
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,320
at the Hall of Flames.


166
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,880
What?


167
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,440
What is the meaning


168
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,070
of these four swords?


169
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,880
Chief Feng,


170
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,640
these are the swords


171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,350
left behind accidentally by your people


172
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,270
when they attacked the Hall of Flames.


173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
Have you just forgotten already?


174
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,480
When did I send people to attack
the Hall of Flames?


175
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,350
You haven’t listened to some slanderer


176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,320
and come here to claim that Huashan Sect


177
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,110
crafted these four ownerless swords, have you?


178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
How dare you groundlessly accuse me


179
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,030
of such a crime?


180
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,080
What’s wrong with the Hall of Flame?


181
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,080
It’s ridiculous!


182
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,080
Chief Feng.


183
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,280
The Hall of Flames never


184
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,440
falsely charges or frames up anyone.


185
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,790
In addition,


186
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,910
we don’t have the nerve


187
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,590
to suspect a major sect like Huashan,
for no reason.


188
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,110
Look, we’re here already.


189
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,150
Just drop the act.


190
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,150
Nonsense.


191
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,110
Sorry for my lack of knowledge,


192
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,670
but I honestly don’t understand


193
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,520
how these four swords


194
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,470
prove that Huashan Sect is guilty?


195
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,590
Huashan Sect


196
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,030
isn’t a small sect
that can be trampled by anyone.


197
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,080
You’re too young to


198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
make a fuss here.


199
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,790
Chief Feng, you might not know this


200
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,350
but now


201
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,230
the Hall of Flames is the supplier of


202
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,280
eighty percent of the weaponry
in the martial world.


203
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,030
We have a unique


204
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,200
blacksmithing technique.


205
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,840
Our sword makers


206
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
leave marks at the bottom of the sword.


207
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
With these marks,


208
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,520
we can look up the record


209
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,670
to know where a particular batch of weapons


210
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,200
were shipped.


211
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,470
Why don’t you


212
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,080
take a look


213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,350
at the marks on the swords?


214
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,550
If you still have doubts,


215
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,790
you can go back to the Hall of Flames
to check the record with us


216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,470
to find out


217
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,670
if these swords were shipped to Huashan Sect.


218
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,280
Chief Feng,


219
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,180
[Liu Er April 21, the third year during the reign of Emperor Jianping]


220
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,320
you aren’t going to tell us that


221
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,000
you gave away
the weapons that you ordered, are you?


222
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,670
Missing weapon


223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,840
is a common case.


224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,760
Or maybe some thieves


225
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,840
snuck into Huashan


226
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,470
to steal these swords.


227
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,520
Chief Feng,


228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,440
you’ve been scheming against


229
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,080
the Hall of Flames for a long time.


230
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,200
We all know what


231
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,150
you did.


232
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,320
I just think a sneaky behavior like this


233
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
really does harm to


234
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,960
the good name of your sect.


235
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,470
If you were to visit us again,


236
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,550
please use the front gate.


237
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,030
I will be the first one to welcome you.


238
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,000
Chief Feng,


239
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
our leader


240
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,760
wanted us to return the swords to you.


241
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,760
Now that you’ve got them,


242
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
we’ll be off.


243
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,320
Sorry for our rudeness, Chief Feng.


244
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,030
Think about it.


245
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,670
Master Shangguan.


246
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,440
We can’t rest now.


247
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,470
It’s already dark.


248
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,910
If we don’t speed up,


249
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,320
we’ll have to camp in the wild.


250
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,400
Wuming.


251
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,640
Get more firewood.


252
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,470
Yes.


253
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,200
Master,


254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
are we really going to camp in the wild?


255
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,520
What?


256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
You can’t get used to it?


257
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,840
I thought we were at least going to


258
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,840
stay in a tavern.


259
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,760
I wanted to enjoy a supreme accommodation


260
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,790
as your fellow traveler.


261
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,840
Wrong move.


262
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,550
I slept in sculptured beds


263
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,550
and on the cold ground in the wild.


264
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,590
You did make a wrong move


265
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,550
if you wanted to
live a comfortable life with me.


266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,520
I thought people like you


267
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,110
were picky and posh.


268
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,790
Oh, Master Shangguan.


269
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,280
I haven’t got the chance to ask you


270
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,790
how it’s going between you
and the little beauty on the way.


271
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Did you...


272
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,960
Why is the look on your face not right


273
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,550
when I mention the little beauty?


274
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,400
Have you two...


275
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,910
No.


276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
Just a small misunderstanding,


277
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,670
which will soon be cleared up.


278
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,230
A small misunderstanding.


279
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,520
Oh, I see.


280
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,840
She must have found out
your little secret, right?


281
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,670
Master Shangguan,


282
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,030
you’re a smart man.


283
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,840
Can’t believe you worry about a trifle like this.


284
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,230
Don’t worry,


285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
it wasn’t your fault.


286
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,760
It was her


287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
being naive.


288
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,110
She didn’t understand


289
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,710
that everyone has their own secret.


290
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,760
So


291
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,150
you have many secrets then?


292
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,080
Not many.


293
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Only one.


294
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,790
But I can’t tell you my secret.


295
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,880
However,


296
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,150
I can tell you


297
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,710
some secrets about Man Feiyue.


298
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,000
Would you like to know?


299
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,960
Do tell.


300
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,030
Listen up,


301
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,760
Man Feiyue’s first secret is that


302
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,350
she was way much older


303
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,590
than her age in the legend,


304
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,910
which is scary, right?


305
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah, this one.


306
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,470
And


307
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,080
she did everything


308
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,030
for money.


309
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,350
You’re talking about yourself, aren’t you?


310
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,590
I’m not like that.


311
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,670
Men love money but we earn it legitimately.


312
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,200
Unlike Man Feiyue


313
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,550
who took all kinds of money


314
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,910
and did all kinds of crazy stuff.


315
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,320
I’m not like her.


316
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,910
Nope.


317
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,550
Even you, a man from Divine Spirit Temple,


318
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,080
think what she did is crazy.


319
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,110
What was it?


320
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,280
Just larcenies


321
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,550
and murders.


322
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,840
Have you earned some money


323
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,110
with Man Feiyue?


324
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:20,910
No, never!


325
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,150
Don’t you slander me.


326
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,350
All I did was fool with


327
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,440
some drunk people.


328
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,520
The thing happened at the Hero Assembly


329
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,440
or the flu in Peace County


330
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,880
or you being lured to Divine Spirit Temple.


331
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,400
All those things.


332
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,670
I didn’t do any of those.


333
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,440
Peace County.


334
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,910
The flu.


335
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,760
Was it Man Feiyue’s leverage


336
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,880
to make money like the Hero Assembly?


337
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,200
I don’t know anything about her leverage.


338
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,910
All I know is that


339
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,080
she got a lot of gold.


340
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,670
Too bad,


341
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,790
I never found the gold.


342
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,080
She might have spent all of the gold, right?


343
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,790
Right.


344
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,670
You probably don’t know this


345
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,320
but the facial maintaining


346
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
spent her a lot of money.


347
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,110
Wasn’t the spread of flu


348
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,520
Man Feiyue’s way
to get back at the martial world?


349
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,880
How did she make money out of it?


350
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,230
Peace County is near the Hall of Flames.


351
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,080
Right after the outbreak of malaria,


352
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,320
some people rebelled


353
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,590
against Xuezhi.


354
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Was it a coincidence


355
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,350
or does the truth still


356
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,590
lie beneath the surface?


357
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,710
Did someone order Man Feiyue


358
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,640
to cause the epidemic?


359
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,080
There’re so many people in Peace County.


360
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,440
Their lives should be worth a lot of gold.


361
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,590
Your trick question doesn’t work on me.


362
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,790
But


363
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,640
I did stumble into her talking to a person
several time.


364
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,280
That person often came to talk to her.


365
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,230
And before long,


366
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,550
the flu spread.


367
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,030
Man Feiyue


368
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,520
started to get gold.


369
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,790
But I don’t know


370
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,320
whether the gold was paid


371
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
to her to kill those residents


372
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,960
or for other purposes.


373
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,110
All I know is


374
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
the thing Man Feiyue wanted the most


375
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,670
was the little beauty’s Lotus Wing
because it’d earn her the most money.


376
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,110
It did have something to do with Xuezhi.


377
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,960
But she could have copied what Hong Sheng did


378
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,550
if she wanted Lotus Wing so much.


379
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,760
All the extra work...


380
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,350
Maybe it wasn’t the manual


381
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,110
but Xuezhi’s life that


382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,910
the person was after.


383
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,400
But who


384
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,910
would do so much


385
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,960
to end Xuezhi’s life?


386
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,080
Feng She.


387
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,760
I think


388
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,030
the gold is hidden somewhere.


389
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,150
What do you mean?


390
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,520
Think about it.


391
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,590
She couldn’t carry all those big gold bricks


392
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,880
with her all the time.


393
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,080
Even if Man Feiyue wanted to spend it all,


394
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,670
she couldn’t have done it in a short time.


395
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,840
Plus,


396
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,000
in a shady business like this,


397
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,670
payment can’t be made at one time.


398
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,560
The gold came in batches


399
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,040
and Man Feiyue died young.


400
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
As long as she didn’t make


401
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,310
the gold into jewelry or whatever.


402
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,230
It must be hidden somewhere.


403
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,310
You’re wrong.


404
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,829
There aren’t


405
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,829
any gold bricks left.


406
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,880
When Man Feiyue got the gold,


407
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,310
she melted it all.


408
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,230
The bricks had become gold dust or gold foil.


409
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
And they were easy to use.


410
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,800
Melting gold


411
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,349
takes time and energy.


412
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,950
If she just wanted to be rich,


413
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,040
it would be too much of work,


414
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,350
which doesn’t make any sense.


415
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,160
Unless the gold


416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,230
was illicit.


417
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,350
Perhaps


418
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,710
the gold was from the authority?


419
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,160
Official gold is always warehoused
after being marked.


420
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,070
If she did that


421
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,560
to make the marks disappear,


422
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,880
then it all makes sense.


423
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,310
Master Shangguan,


424
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,800
what’s on your mind?


425
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,310
Are you feeling bad


426
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,190
for the gold as well?


427
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,070
The malaria


428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,280
wasn’t as simple as I thought it was.


429
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,040
I’m worried that Xuezhi is endangered.


430
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,470
What is this supposed to mean?


431
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,640
God can prove


432
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,800
that I never did any harm to the little beauty.


433
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,640
I stayed away


434
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,520
when Man Feiyue firstly gave her a hard time.


435
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,590
And to find out the truth,


436
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,640
I was locked up and nearly killed by her.


437
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,430
You didn’t do it for Xuezhi


438
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,590
but the gold, right?


439
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,830
To me, the little beauty is


440
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,520
as important as the gold.


441
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,430
As important as the gold.


442
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,350
Fengzi.


443
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,560
I need to go to bed.


444
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,920
Qingmei.


445
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,280
Are you hiding away from me on purpose?


446
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,190
You’re overthinking it.


447
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,280
I suddenly feel


448
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,640
that I can’t


449
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
keep bothering you all the time like I used to,


450
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,640
which only annoys you.


451
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,590
I know


452
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,920
that you hate me.


453
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,680
I went too far


454
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,310
this time.


455
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,560
I should haven’t hastily


456
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,920
agreed the engagement.


457
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,710
I failed you


458
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
and put the entire Sword Manor


459
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,710
in shame.


460
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,470
I myself have become


461
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,310
the biggest laughingstock in the martial world.


462
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,070
You misread me.


463
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,000
I have no intention to blame you.


464
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,310
You don’t need


465
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,470
to feel guilty


466
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,400
about this matter.


467
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,000
Qingmei.


468
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,110
I’ve hurt you.


469
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,310
I don’t expect that you’d forgive me right now


470
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,000
but please allow me to apologize to you.


471
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,830
OK?


472
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,470
It’s OK.


473
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
I’m used to it.


474
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,710
It’s late.


475
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,830
Goodnight.


476
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,460
[Emei]


477
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,710
Chief Feng,


478
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,590
what brings you here?


479
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,230
I’m here to discuss


480
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,800
something important with you.


481
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,920
Do you know


482
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,520
why the martial world doesn’t


483
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
get a moment of peace?


484
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,070
A question with a clear answer.


485
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,470
Because of the Hall of Flames.


486
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,590
Yes.


487
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,760
Everybody wants to end the Hall of Flames


488
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,040
yet no one has ever made it.


489
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Why?


490
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,350
Because everybody


491
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,760
acts on their own.


492
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
They never worked together.


493
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,310
I came today


494
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,470
in hope of


495
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,710
joining forces with Emei


496
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,920
to destroy the cult once and for all.


497
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,430
To return peace to the martial world.


498
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,430
What do you think?


499
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
Joining forces with you?


500
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,400
What’s in it for me?


501
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,400
Are you suggesting that without Huashan Sect,


502
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
Emei isn’t


503
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,760
capable of destroying the cult?


504
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,710
And


505
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,800
the witch of the Hall of Flames


506
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,040
is but a callow whelp.


507
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,000
Even if I let her grow,


508
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,310
she


509
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,350
can’t be a threat.


510
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,710
Plus, Emei


511
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,230
is just uncomfortable


512
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,310
with the arrogance of the cult.


513
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,470
We don’t actually lose anything.


514
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
Perhaps you don’t


515
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,560
lose anything for now.


516
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,350
But Chong Xuezhi


517
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,190
has achieved the fifth move of Lotus Wing.


518
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,160
Within years,


519
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,950
she’ll become the greatest martial artist


520
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,470
like her dad.


521
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,710
She’ll rule the martial world.


522
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,590
By then,


523
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,190
will you hold the same attitude?


524
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,110
We’ve always been


525
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,920
adverse to the Hall of Flames.


526
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,920
If Chong Xuezhi follows in her father’s footsteps,


527
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,470
the first sects she would retaliate against


528
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,430
would be us.


529
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,590
What’s more,


530
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,160
Chong Xuezhi is close to


531
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,310
Shangguan Tou.


532
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,520
Shangguan Tou


533
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,880
is the son of the Imperial Advisor


534
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,800
and the leader of Moon Valley.


535
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,190
He has power


536
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,230
and money.


537
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,110
If they joined forces,


538
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,230
who would be able to oppose them


539
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,160
in the martial world?


540
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,280
She is, dare I say it,


541
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,830
conspiring with him


542
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,590
to rule


543
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,560
the entire martial world.


544
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,310
If so,


545
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,680
Chong Xuezhi


546
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,160
will grow into


547
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,680
a horrible threat.


548
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
I’ve made up my mind.


549
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,680
We must eradicate the Hall of Flames


550
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,110
as soon as possible.


551
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,680
If Emei is willing to aid me,


552
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,710
I guarantee you that


553
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
Emei’s standing in the martial world


554
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,520
will rise accordingly.


555
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,070
You’ll be as prestigious as Huashan Sect.


556
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,760
Since you’re


557
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,400
so determined to


558
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,190
uproot the Hall of Flames,


559
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,760
why would you need my help?


560
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,400
There’re many sects.


561
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,070
Why do you


562
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,280
choose Emei?


563
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,430
Because, in my opinion,


564
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:33,800
you


565
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,350
are a heroine in the martial world.


566
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,430
The No. 1 female martial artist


567
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,070
in the world.


568
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,350
Master.


569
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,760
Wuming.


570
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,400
I’m going to see Mr. Lin.


571
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,070
You watch him.


572
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,350
Understood.


573
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,880
Shangguan Tou.


574
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,520
Keep your mouth shut.


575
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,430
He is busy.


576
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,560
You stay with me.


577
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,950
You?


578
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,590
I’m better off alone.


579
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,350
Mr. Feng,


580
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,760
this is Moon Valley.


581
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,470
I advise you be good.


582
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,680
I’m less patient than Master Shangguan.


583
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,070
OK.


584
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,590
Sir.


585
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,680
What, Tou?


586
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,160
You were away for quite a while


587
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,280
and came back with this look on your face.


588
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,710
You don’t need to say anything.


589
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,640
I know you fell out with my daughter.


590
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,680
We had a misunderstanding


591
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,710
because Xuezhi chose to listen to
someone else over me.


592
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,230
Since it was a misunderstanding,


593
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,830
why didn’t you explain to her?


594
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,760
I just don’t


595
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,830
have a perfect explanation for this matter.


596
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,070
Tell me about it


597
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,280
In fact,


598
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,190
you’re also related to it.


599
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,070
Fengzi.


600
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,190
You and me are in one time in the evening.


601
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,520
It’s inappropriate to close the door.


602
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,760
Just one sip.


603
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,560
One sip.


604
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,470
-Master.
-Shangguan Tou!


605
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,590
Bastard!


606
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,190
I accepted you as a disciple.


607
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,400
I can’t believe you did such a filthy thing.


608
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,710
Master.


609
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,400
No.


610
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,760
-I didn’t.
-Dad.


611
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,400
Master.


612
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
You!


613
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
You’re shameless!


614
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,640
Dad.


615
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,310
No!


616
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,640
Fengzi, shut up.


617
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,000
It’s already messed up.


618
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,000
Bastard!


619
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,880
You broke the sect rules


620
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,040
by practicing swordplay in secret
and defiling a peer disciple.


621
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,800
From now on,


622
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,470
your martial moves are deprived of.


623
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,680
You’re expelled.


624
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,760
I was young


625
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,280
but I was fully conscious.


626
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
There was nothing


627
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,310
between me and Lin Fengzi.


628
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,230
I didn’t know how to justify myself.


629
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,350
I didn’t expect


630
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,590
that Lin Zongxing would never
let go of this matter.


631
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,280
Not only he deprived me of my martial moves,


632
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,280
but he also sent someone to assassinate me.


633
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,830
No wonder you were at your last gasp


634
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,640
when I found you.


635
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,310
If I hadn’t known your past,


636
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,470
I wouldn’t have sent you to Sword Manor.


637
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,760
Don’t feel guilty.


638
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,190
It’ll


639
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,000
be uncovered sooner or later.


640
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,400
It’s better that I get it off my chest.


641
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,680
Then why


642
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,230
didn’t you tell me the full story


643
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,040
when I asked?


644
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,310
You are always like this.


645
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,920
You keep everything to yourself.


646
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:27,430
There are many things that
you can’t deal with on your own.


647
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,230
I know you.


648
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,230
You don’t want to trouble others.


649
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,040
But one day, you’ll be crushed


650
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,560
if you keep shouldering the burden alone.


651
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
So what will you do next?


652
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,710
Do you need me to persuade my daughter?


653
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,760
I just hope that


654
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,880
Xuezhi can forgive me.


655
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,520
I don’t want her to hate me.


656
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,640
Since it’s a misunderstanding,


657
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,950
just talk it out.


658
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,430
I know my daughter.


659
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,070
No matter how mad she gets,


660
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,920
she’ll calm down in a couple of days.


661
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,800
But it’s not


662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
a small matter.


663
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,470
It might take her a while longer.


664
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,160
You guys can take the time


665
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,310
to cool off.


666
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,880
So be it then.


667
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,310
And


668
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,000
I have a more important thing to do.


669
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,280
The spread of the flu


670
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,430
that Man Feiyue caused earlier.


671
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,280
Everybody thought she did it


672
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,350
to get back at the martial world.


673
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,470
But I recently discovered that


674
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,400
she was taking orders


675
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
from someone.


676
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,230
She was her pawn.


677
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,040
The person always managed to secede


678
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
from it at the critical point.


679
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,880
He mustn’t be a nobody.


680
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,680
I’m worried that


681
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,190
he’s up to a bigger conspiracy.


682
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,470
So I must dig out his identity.


683
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:45,920
Tou.


684
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,400
I thought you didn’t give a damn
about the martial world.


685
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,680
I’m worried that Xuezhi is his target.


686
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,190
If I don’t find him,


687
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,070
he’ll find Xuezhi.


688
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
So why don’t


689
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,640
I just preempt him?


690
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,230
Do you have any leads?


691
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,560
Not yet.


692
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,760
But I have a friend


693
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,350
who might have the information that I need.


694
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,110
Who?


695
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,940
[Winehouse of Fairyland]


696
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,920
Hongxiu.


697
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,070
A Huashan disciple is drunk in there.


698
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,470
He touched me with his filthy hands.


699
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,310
Stop crying. Take me there.


700
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,640
Throw him out if necessary.


701
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,710
Drop the act.


702
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,470
Get up.


703
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,190
Mr. Zhang.


704
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,830
Mr. Zhang.


705
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,040
Mr. Zhang.


706
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,950
Mr. Zhang...


707
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,950
Move, move, move.


708
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,110
Shoo! Shoo!


709
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,430
What is it?


710
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,280
What are you doing?


711
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,470
Listen to me!


712
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,470
Chong Xuezhi the witch


713
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,230
killed a man


714
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,470
at Winehouse of Fairyland.


715
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,710
Sir,


716
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,800
please lower your voice.


717
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
We’re running a business here.


718
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,310
My senior fellow died here.


719
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,880
All you think about is making money?


720
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
No way.


721
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,640
Today,


722
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,470
if you don’t turn in the witch,


723
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,310
we


724
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,830
will tear


725
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,400
the Winehouse down.


726
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,950
Well then.


727
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,430
I’ll call the authority.


728
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,470
It has nothing to do with me.


729
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
Since someone died at my Winehouse,


730
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,950
I


731
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,070
won’t stay away from this.


732
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,000
But this is a place of grace.


733
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,710
You can’t have an investigation or a trail here.


734
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,230
If you have anything to say,


735
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,430
please speak with the judge.


736
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,230
I-I’m afraid that...


737
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,160
What are you afraid of?


738
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,760
You didn’t kill him.


739
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,160
We’re martial artists.


740
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,470
We don’t need the authority to be involved.


741
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,640
Huashan disciples may be martial artists,


742
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
we’re not.


743
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,520
Winehouse of Fairyland


744
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,000
is a premise for business operation.


745
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,760
And we’ve always been


746
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,350
neutral in the martial world.


747
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,950
All sects show


748
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,640
a little respect for me.


749
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,760
I’ve been running the business
in peace for years,


750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
no one would intentionally make trouble here.


751
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,040
But today


752
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,000
I found a dead body in my Winehouse.


753
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,520
Not just you,


754
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
I would swear


755
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,880
that I’ll


756
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,710
find out the truth.


757
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,190
Sir,


758
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,680
this is


759
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,950
what happened.


760
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,710
Hongxiu saw


761
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,430
the rest.


762
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,950
Miss Qiu.


763
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,430
Have you seen anyone suspicious


764
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,880
at Winehouse of Fairyland last night?


765
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,430
Sir.


766
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,640
Come on.


767
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,000
Winehouse of Fairyland


768
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,470
receives hundreds of guests


769
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,950
on a daily basis.


770
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,400
How can I


771
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,070
remember every one of them?


772
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,350
Miss Qiu.


773
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,640
This isn’t a joke.


774
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,110
Your place


775
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,560
is neutral


776
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,230
but the sixth disciple of Huashan Sect


777
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
died here.


778
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,040
Plus,


779
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,800
you and I both know


780
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,520
that the five-petal lotus


781
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,040
is the mark of Nine Moves of Lotus God.


782
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,760
Everybody knows that


783
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,430
Nine Moves of Lotus God


784
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,310
is the exclusive move of the Hall of Flames.


785
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,830
Apart from Chong Xuezhi,


786
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,430
who else


787
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,350
could the murderer be?


788
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,040
Sir,


789
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,520
you haven’t looked into the case yet.


790
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,040
How can you be so sure


791
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,190
she is the murderer?


792
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,429
I know


793
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,429
you have your own rules in the martial world.


794
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,230
But I’m warning you as an official


795
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,190
that the Imperial Court


796
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,710
governs the martial world.


797
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,760
Yes.


798
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
The new appointed Magistrate of Suzhou


799
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,760
hates to see people in the martial world


800
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,870
make trouble


801
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,870
and commit crimes


802
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:35,190
under his jurisdiction.


803
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,949
So


804
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,040
I’ll look into


805
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,320
this case.


806
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,040
Soldiers,


807
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,280
bring the corpse back.


808
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,710
Get a coroner


809
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,190
to examine the body.


810
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,280
Yes.


811
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,430
Xuezhi.


812
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,230
Muyuan.


813
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,710
You’ve made


814
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
a remarkable progress these days.


815
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,000
After a few more days of practicing,


816
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,710
I should be able to make a breakthrough
to the sixth move.


817
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,870
Good.


818
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,520
Muyuan,


819
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,910
are you still worried about Huashan Sect?


820
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,870
Indeed.


821
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,390
You’re a lot stronger than you used to be,


822
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,080
even Feng Cheng


823
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,760
won’t necessarily be a match for you.


824
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
What I’m worried about is


825
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,840
Huashan is a major sect,


826
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
if we confront them openly,


827
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,600
other sects will


828
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,430
back Huashan up.


829
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,560
I don’t think so.


830
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,910
Muyuan,


831
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
Huashan Sect


832
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,870
attacked us first.


833
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,280
And over the years,


834
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,630
all sects have been calling us a cult,


835
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,630
calling me a witch.


836
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
They tried to destroy us many times.


837
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:11,910
Instead, I think that


838
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,320
only by toughening up can we make


839
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
Huashan Sect an example.


840
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,150
So that


841
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,120
we show all sects our attitude,


842
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,870
so that they won’t look down upon us anymore.


843
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,520
You’ve become


844
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,000
more and more like a leader.


845
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,390
But I’m still concerned.


846
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,280
I know.


847
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,120
You’re worried about me.


848
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,520
Haven’t you just said that


849
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,840
I’ve made a remarkable progress?


850
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,150
That even Feng Cheng would


851
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,150
be no match for me?


852
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,760
That said,


853
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,390
I think


854
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,520
we should still


855
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,000
avoid facing him.


856
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,710
Leader,


857
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,000
here’s a letter


858
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,840
from Hongxiu.


859
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,380
[To Leader Chong]


860
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,460
[resembles Nine Moves of Lotus God very much]


861
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,560
Nine Moves of Lotus God.


862
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,190
How is it possible?


863
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,000
It does sound suspicious.


864
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,190
Hong Sheng stole Nine Moves


865
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,230
during Hero Assembly and practiced for himself.


866
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,320
But he’s dead.


867
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,670
There can’t be another person


868
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,230
in the martial world


869
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,520
that knows Nine Moves of Lotus God.


870
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,470
But the letter from Winehouse of Fairyland


871
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
says the lotus mark is


872
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
on the dead Huashan disciple’s body.


873
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,840
What could it be if it wasn’t Nine Moves?


874
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:37,950
All in all,


875
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,320
if we don’t find out the truth,


876
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,230
it’ll be hard to clear your name as a murderer.


877
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,910
Yes.


878
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,040
During the previous pandemic,


879
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,910
the chief of Shark Sect Tie Xiao


880
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,800
was also killed by Nine Moves.


881
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,560
Could it be the person


882
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,520
that committed two murders?


883
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,080
Maybe Hong Sheng


884
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,760
didn’t die?


885
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,670
He took many shots of arrows


886
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,670
but because Gugu was also shot


887
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
and Zhusha was badly injured,


888
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,630
I was busy taking care of Zhusha,


889
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,190
I didn’t have time to check his body.


890
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,950
Now that I think about it,


891
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
he probably wasn’t dead at all.


892
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,910
He might have just fainted due to the injuries.


893
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,150
If what Liuli said is true,


894
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,320
then it’s possible that


895
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,150
Hong Sheng framed us up


896
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,630
for murder.


897
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,470
But why did he kill a Huashan disciple?


898
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,710
That’s what confuses me.


899
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,150
To avoid Huashan Sect making it personal,


900
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,120
Hongxiu has reported the case to the authority.


901
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,600
So that Huashan Sect


902
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,630
won’t push too hard.


903
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,840
But she doesn’t know


904
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,950
what exactly happened.


905
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,080
That’s why


906
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,190
she wants me personally
to go to Winehouse of Fairyland


907
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,040
to investigate the case.


908
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,280
No.


909
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,040
Everybody knows that


910
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,870
there’s a feud between


911
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,360
Huashan Sect and the Hall of Flames.


912
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,710
If


913
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,360
Hong Sheng killed a Huashan disciple on purpose,


914
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,760
first of all,


915
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,320
he gets to bring


916
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,710
the feud to the next level,


917
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,670
secondly,


918
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,000
it can be a trap


919
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,870
that intends to lure you out.


920
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,670
Yes, Leader Chong.


921
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
The Chief Guardian has a point.


922
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,320
It might be a trap.


923
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,840
The purpose is to lure you there.


924
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,600
Leader,


925
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,040
you mustn’t fall into the trap.


926
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,800
Yes, leader.


927
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,280
However, I think she should go.


928
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,840
Leader,


929
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,670
you should personally find out the truth.


930
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,950
It can prove that you


931
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,000
and the Hall of Flames are innocent.


932
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,390
Elder in chief,


933
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,320
we’re too far away from


934
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,360
Winehouse of Fairyland.


935
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,470
She might come across danger


936
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,950
on the way there.


937
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,840
Please give it a second thought.


938
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,600
Leader,


939
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,630
all kinds of people go in and out of


940
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,230
Winehouse of Fairyland.


941
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,280
And we aren’t sure if Qiu Honxiu’s on our side.


942
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,840
You won’t necessarily


943
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,870
get any information there.


944
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,040
Muyuan,


945
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,950
If Hongxiu and Zhong Tao hadn’t


946
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,390
aided us in attacking


947
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,870
Divine Spirit Temple,


948
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,390
I would have been killed there.


949
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,670
Not to mention


950
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,670
she brought Feng She here
for the antidote research.


951
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,950
So I’m sure Hongxiu is on our side.


952
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,430
And


953
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,000
since Zhong Tao died,


954
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,710
I don’t know how she’s been doing.


955
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,600
During the visit to Winehouse of Fairyland,


956
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,040
on the one hand,


957
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,080
I can check how she’s doing,


958
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,800
on the other hand,


959
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:46,000
I can pay respects to Zhong Tao’s tomb.


960
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,280
After all,


961
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,430
he died for us.


962
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,470
And


963
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,600
only by catching the murderer


964
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,000
can we save others from being harmed.


965
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:57,670
Chief Guardian,


966
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,600
our leader is right.


967
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,470
Why don’t we go with her?


968
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,560
Yes, Chief Guardian.


969
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,910
Well then.


970
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,520
I’ll go with you.


971
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,040
And me.


972
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,840
It’s said that Winehouse of Fairyland
is the paradise on earth.


973
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,230
I haven’t been there yet.


974
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,080
You stay here.


975
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,280
Liuli will go with us.


976
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,000
OK.


977
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,000
You and Chequ stay.


978
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,430
Strengthen the disciples’ practicing


979
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,120
in case Huashan Sect attacks us again.


980
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,280
Yes.


981
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,820
[Winehouse of Fairyland]


982
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,840
Tou,


983
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,190
what brings you here?


984
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,320
I’m here as a patron.


985
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,280
Nice to see you too, lad.


986
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,560
Are you talking about me?


987
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,000
Don’t call me lad.


988
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,630
Call me Feng She.


989
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,430
Tou.


990
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,840
I will


991
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,600
get off your back.


992
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,120
But my eyes


993
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,670
are on Mr. Feng here.


994
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,710
He’s quite good.


995
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:00,910
Very good.


996
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:02,840
Shangguan Tou,


997
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,630
what does she mean by good?


998
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,870
Feng She.


999
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,470
Do you know what this place is?


1000
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,870
I don’t.


1001
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,360
But


1002
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,910
it is different from other places.


1003
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,600
It’s fair to say it’s a paradise.


1004
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,470
Winehouse of Fairyland indeed is a paradise.


1005
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,000
Guests here


1006
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,430
live like celestials.


1007
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,080
Live like celestials?


1008
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
What lives do celestials live?


1009
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,190
Male guests come here to


1010
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,760
listen to music, eat fruits


1011
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and watch girls.


1012
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,600
We have many fairies here.


1013
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,150
Those fairies


1014
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,320
particularly


1015
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,360
like handsome young lads like you.


1016
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,430
Forget it. You guys keep chatting.


1017
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,520
I don’t fit in this place.


1018
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,710
Feng She,


1019
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,080
You haven’t seen the fairies yet.


1020
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,670
How do you know you don’t fit in here?
