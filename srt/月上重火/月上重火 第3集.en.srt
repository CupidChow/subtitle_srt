00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,900
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 3

4
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,270
Chiefs,

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,160
if this manual will cause trouble,

6
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,550
I say we should burn it

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,240
for good.

8
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,960
Don’t. Don’t. Don’t do it!

9
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,520
You all deem it to be wicked,

10
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,720
but then why don’t you let me burn it?

11
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,750
However wicked it is,

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,440
it should be disposed by professional schools like us

13
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
after deliberation.

14
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,960
It is not up to you to deal with it.

15
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,079
How decisive you are, Young Master.

16
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,720
We are fortunate to have you.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,790
This art is so wicked that

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,390
burning a part of it will be in vain.

19
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
In the Lotus Wind,

20
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,390
Nine Moves of Lotus God is the most powerful.

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,320
Why don’t we gather the two parts

22
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,270
of the Lotus Wind

23
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,630
and discuss its disposal?

24
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,550
What do you think?

25
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,750
What’s your opinion, Master Shiyan?

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,630
Fellows,

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,110
come with me to fetch the Move Nine of Lotus God.

28
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
Why is it empty?

29
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,910
What?

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,829
There’s not a word on the manual.

31
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,269
What happened?

32
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,440
That’s not possible.

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,269
How come?

34
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,640
That’s not possible. I…

35
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,350
What…

36
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,480
Five years ago, you all witnessed it

37
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,410
when the manual was deposited into

38
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,040
the Sword Manor.

39
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,350
How come the words on it are gone?

40
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,350
Are you trying to

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,040
blame us for this?

42
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,510
Then, Hierarch Yuan

43
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,000
and Mr. Xia, please tell us.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,920
Where have the manual been in the past 5 years?

45
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Who have ever touched it?

46
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,110
The manual has been well guarded

47
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,510
in the Sword Manor.

48
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,320
I handed it to Master Shiyan

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,040
when I was poisoned.

50
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,300
Master Shiyan,

51
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
how would you defend yourself?

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
Merciful Buddha.

53
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,510
Mr. Xia, please mind your words.

54
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,190
For words can spread the seed of injustice.

55
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,600
That’s not my intention.

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,070
The Luduan Temple boasts a history of over 100 years.

57
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,600
We possess countless precious books and classics.

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
This wicked art means nothing to us.

59
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,160
Among all of us here,

60
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,160
you disciples of the evil Hall of Flames

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,950
want the manual most, right?

62
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,320
That manual belongs to us from the very beginning.

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,000
We don’t need to play such nasty trick

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,230
to get it back.

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,510
The combination of the Lotus Sutra and the Nine Moves of Lotus God

66
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,110
makes the invincible

67
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,110
Lotus Wind.

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,270
This is known to all of us.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,550
Exactly.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
But only the Hall of Flames

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,510
can unlock the Lotus Bud Lock.

72
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,510
It is fair to say

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,290
that the thief of the manual

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
must be from the Hall of Flames.

75
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,640
You will have to figure this out today.

76
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,440
That’s right!

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,550
Figure this out.

78
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,270
Everyone,

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,480
please use your brain.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,270
We are the only school

81
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,510
in the world that can identify

82
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,440
the genuine Nine Moves of Lotus God

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,600
We could easily replace it with a fake.

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,930
Why are we so stupid to make it an empty one?

85
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,270
The top priority now

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,350
is to find out the thief

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,880
and find the real manual.

88
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,000
How should we deal with this then?

89
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,440
We won’t let it be.

90
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,550
The manual comes from our Hall of Flames

91
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,580
and we will definitely find it out

92
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,110
to comfort you all.

93
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,350
Comfort us?

94
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Won’t you hide it up

95
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,670
when you find the manual？

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,920
We are also to blame for the

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,830
failure in keeping the manual.

98
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,070
So

99
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,270
we will work with the Hall of Flames in the investigation.

100
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,200
Don’t just pay lip-service.

101
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,200
Tell us when you will find it and report to us.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
And how should we deal with you

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
if you can’t find the manual?

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Or,

105
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,070
what if some of you master the moves

106
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,159
before handing the manual out?

107
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,200
Abbess,

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,920
even someone like you

109
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,390
needs at least 3 years

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,450
to master the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

111
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,720
We ask for 3 months.

112
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,720
We will report to you on the

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,550
Weapon Ranking Convention 3 months later.

114
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,320
Deal.

115
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,230
Then

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
3 months it is.

117
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,550
Hope you can find the manual

118
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,720
in 3 months

119
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,040
to prove your innocence.

120
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,070
What?

121
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,950
Haitang sent a message with her eagle

122
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,659
saying that the Nine Moves of Lotus God is missing.

123
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:44,820
[Manual missing Dispute delayed
for the search till the Convention in 3 months]

124
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,550
All schools

125
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,480
have set out to look for the manual.

126
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,320
They will decide how to deal with the Hall of Flames

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,440
3 months later

128
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,370
on the Weapon Ranking Convention.

129
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,350
Leader,

[Yu Wan, the Hall of Flames. ]

131
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,640
what should we do now?

132
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,200
Ask Muyuan

133
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,730
to come back immediately.

134
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,350
What about Chong Xuezhi?

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,110
I love to see where she is now.

136
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,920
I see.

137
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,600
Now the manual’s whereabouts are unknown.

138
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,760
All schools are searching for it like mad.

139
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
If they find it first,

140
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
they will undoubtedly make it their own.

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,390
We have to do something.

142
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,070
I bet it’s Abbess Ciren,

143
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,920
if it’s not the Huashan School.

144
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,670
Wang Yinya is suspicious too.

145
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,600
Suddenly everyone becomes suspicious.

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Tell me about it.

147
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,760
There are two

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
top suspects.

149
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,510
the Sword Manor and the Luduan Temple.

150
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,590
The Sword Manor claimed to be working with us,

151
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,850
but they’re still likely to be the thief.

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,710
In fact,

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,330
I’ve got  a important  question to make.

154
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
The lock is our unique design.

155
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,520
Who would have unlocked it

156
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,400
apart from our people?

157
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,880
Too many questions.

158
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,350
We’re totally clueless.

159
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,280
The manual was lost from the Luduan Temple,

160
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,670
so the temple must be the top suspect.

161
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,000
I will start from there.

162
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,960
How? I’ll come with you.

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,080
No.

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Your responsibility now, Young Master,

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,660
is to protect the Lotus Sutra.

166
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,350
And you should guard her with your life.

167
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,030
I can go to

168
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
the Luduan Temple alone.

169
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,640
Mister, will you stay or leave?

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,200
Merciful Buddha.

Leader.

172
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,640
You set me up, Master Shiyan?

173
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,910
The manual was lost from our temple after all.

174
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,200
I have to do something, right?

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,330
But everyone knows the manual in your hand

176
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,350
is empty now.

177
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,440
So nobody will come to you for it.

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,320
I have no idea

179
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,640
why you set a trap.

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,080
If the Hall of Flames stole the manual,

181
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,150
their people would not come here.

182
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,640
Master, you are trying to prove our innocence?

183
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Yes.

184
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,710
If this is what you want,

185
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,760
Then

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,200
why don’t you let me go now?

187
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,150
If I let you go,

188
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,400
how can you know my mind?

189
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,080
So you want us to prove your innocence in return?

190
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,550
To be frank,

191
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
I have searched the temple over and over again,

192
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,110
but found nothing.

193
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,350
You come here

194
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,280
to find out the suspect.

195
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,710
But from now on,

196
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,590
you can come in from the front gate

197
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,550
for anything

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,470
without any worries.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,910
Master,

200
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,590
would you like to

201
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,120
speak for the Hall of Flames

202
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,670
in the Weapon Ranking Convention?

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,350
I will definitely tell the public truthfully

204
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,840
about what I have seen and thought.

205
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,170
Thank you, Master.

206
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,880
Merciful Buddha.

207
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,840
So the Luduan Temple

208
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,910
is off the suspect list now?

209
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,710
Right.

210
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,110
Young Master,

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Xia Qinggmei left at night

212
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,110
When he was not fully recovered.

213
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,840
He headed for the Sword Manor.

214
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,030
I bet this has something to do

215
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,490
with the theft of the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

216
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,550
He must be feeling guilty.

217
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
His leave is suspicious though,

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,130
I don’t think it was the Sword Manor

219
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,750
who stole the manual.

220
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,080
But if this worries you,

221
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,480
I can catch up with him and figure it out.

222
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,280
Then I’ll stay here for further investigation.

223
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
That will be good.

224
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,550
After that,

225
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,230
I’ll go back home and discuss with the elders.

226
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,790
Good.

227
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,610
Muyuan, wait a minute.

228
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,470
I should leave the Lotus Sutra with you.

229
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,350
I don’t feel safe when it’s with me.

230
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,480
But if it’s with you, I feel reassured.

231
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,710
But…

232
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,520
OK.

233
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,590
I’ll leave it with the elders

234
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,520
when I return to the Hall of Flames.

235
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Haitang,

236
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
send me a message with the eagle at once

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,590
if anything happens.

238
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,350
Yes.

239
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,790
Take good care of Young Master

240
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,080
when I’m not around.

241
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,870
We will, Chief Guardian.

242
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,030
Mr. Xia,

243
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,400
are you OK?

244
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,520
Careful.

245
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,210
Chief Guardian,

246
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,360
where are you going?

247
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,730
The Hall of Flames.

248
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,110
You’ve not recovered yet.

249
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,280
I’m afraid that if you go alone…

250
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,150
This is nothing.

251
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,520
I’ve made a terrible mistake.

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,030
I have to report to my master and apologize.

253
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,240
I understand.

254
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,470
I’m going this way too. Let me accompany you.

255
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,510
You want to go to the Sword Manor, don’t you?

256
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,350
That’s not true.

257
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,960
I’m doing so simply because

258
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,790
I’m worrying about your safety

259
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,000
given your poor condition.

260
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,620
[Tianbao Inn]

261
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,960
Xuezhi!

262
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,960
Fengzi, why are you here?

263
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,900
You two go in first.

264
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,210
I’m here to say goodbye to you.

265
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,090
I’m going back to the Sword Manor.

266
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,200
You’re leaving?

267
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,760
Sorry about what happened

268
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,300
during the Hero Assembly.

269
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,030
I’m fine.

270
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,230
Don’t worry about me.

271
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,320
I’ve got a question for you.

272
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,340
Do you know Shangguan Tou?

273
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,620
Shangguan Tou?

274
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,170
The one who saved you in the Hero Assembly.

275
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,110
I don’t know.

276
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,470
You don’t?

277
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,590
I thought you knew him.

278
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,320
I was going to ask you about him.

279
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,130
Then I have no more questions.

280
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,460
Go back and have a rest.

281
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,400
Take care.

282
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Qingmei.

283
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
[Sword Manor]

284
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,320
Qingmei’s back.

285
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,000
Could you please tell Mr. Lin that

286
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,180
Muyuan from the Hall of Flames comes for visit?

287
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,420
[Sword Manor]

288
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,470
How come?

289
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,760
Master, please believe me.

290
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,640
It’s not me who lost the manual.

291
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
I had been guarding the box the whole way.

292
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,590
I’d never opened it.

293
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,850
Only when I was poisoned

294
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,280
and thus unable to protect the manual

295
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,210
did I hand it over to Master Shiyan.

296
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,550
I’ve never changed it.

297
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,320
Master.

298
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,080
I left for the Manor at once nonstop to inform you.

299
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,090
How’s your body now?

300
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,840
I’m fine.

301
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,350
Qingmei,

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,530
Your safety is all I ask for.

303
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,200
I believe in you.

304
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,790
This is tricky.

305
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,940
We will have to study it at length.

306
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,880
You haven’t recovered yet.

307
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,230
I command that you have a good rest.

308
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,520
Master,

309
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
may I ask you to meet someone?

310
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,060
[Tianbao Inn]

311
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:23,990
Young Master,

312
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,109
why did that lady come up to you?

313
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,349
No big deal.

314
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,500
She asked me about Shangguan Tou.

315
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,520
I think she’s jealous of you

316
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,650
because Master Shangguan helped you.

317
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,230
To be honest,

318
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,680
I kind of envy you too.

319
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Envy me?

320
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,520
What has that man done

321
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,170
to capture all your hearts?

322
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,950
He is the son of the Imperial Advisor.

323
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,400
People called him “the male version of Zhaojun”,

324
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,070
or the Preeminent Shangguan Tou.

325
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,590
Some say he’s unruly or well-educated.

326
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,710
But some say he’s flirty,

327
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,710
seducing ladies with eye contact.

328
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,830
But to me, what attracts me most about him

329
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,960
is his ethereality.

330
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,430
He’s just like Zhaojun, heavenly and perfect.

331
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,680
He could have defeated Xia Qingmei

332
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,160
in the Hero Assembly.

333
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,920
I say he lost to Xia deliberately

334
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,870
Because he was after the manual.

335
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,760
Remember

336
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,110
when Master Shangguan

337
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,040
sent Young Master back in his arms?

338
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,070
That was way too charming!

339
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,230
Everyone got envious.

340
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,190
Finished?

341
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,350
If so,

342
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
I’ll need some space.

343
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,110
OK.

344
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,950
That’s romantic.

345
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,680
Let’s go.

346
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,680
Hey.

347
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
Excuse me. Do you know Shangguan Tou?

348
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,350
Of course.

349
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,110
Everyone knows the Preeminent Shangguan Tou

350
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,280
here in Dongdu City.

351
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,680
Do you know where he lives?

352
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,080
I’ll give you some money.

353
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,280
I tell you.

354
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,430
Go westward for 1 km or so

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,680
then go southward into the lane, and you’re there.

356
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,070
Nonsense.

357
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,590
He doesn’t live there.

358
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,500
Miss, give the money to me.

359
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,160
I’ll tell you where he lives.

360
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,160
You find the Dongdu government office first

361
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
and the second mansion on the left

362
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,110
is Shangguan Tou’s house.

363
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,070
Give me money.

364
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,110
-Hurry up.
-Rubbish.

365
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,840
That’s where his butler lives.

366
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,000
Miss, they’re trying to cheat you.

367
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,350
I used to deliver ingredients to the Imperial Teacher’s Mansion.

368
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,830
I know where he lives.

369
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,040
Give me money.

370
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,040
He’s lying. I’m telling the truth.

371
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,160
-Trust me.
-Trust me.
-Trust me.

372
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,000
Come with me.

373
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,350
Miss, don’t go.

374
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,190
See what you’ve done!

375
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,590
You’ve ruined my chance!

376
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,950
Have you found anything?

377
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,550
The manual is still missing.

378
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,560
But…

379
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,230
What?

380
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,880
Someone is

381
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,850
looking for you.

382
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,280
Have a look.

383
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,800
Flowers.

384
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:18,920
Flowers.

385
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,950
Lanterns. Beautiful lanterns

386
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,110
Have a look.

387
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,800
Umbrellas. Nice umbrellas.

388
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,070
You’re here, sir.

389
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,070
I know you, Miss.

390
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,530
You’ve come for Shangguan Tou again?

391
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,110
No. It’s not about him.

392
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,720
I want to ask you about another person.

393
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,560
Fire away.

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Do you know

395
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,830
where I can find a flirty man?

396
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,580
You don’t need to look for one.

397
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,970
Every man on the street is flirty.

398
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,680
Even I am flirty.

399
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,000
That’s not what I mean.

400
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,230
I’ll try again. Do you know where I can find

401
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,280
the flirtiest man in the world?

402
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,560
The flirtiest man?

403
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,160
Well…

404
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,560
that I don’t know.

405
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,040
Flowers.

406
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,110
Flowers.

407
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
Miss, I tell you.

408
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,780
If you’re looking for the flirtiest man,

409
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,680
go to Qingguan House.

410
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,190
Right over there.

411
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,280
Gullible.

412
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,890
What are you doing?

413
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,800
Hero,

414
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
easy there.

415
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,190
Mister,

416
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,310
you’re a treacherous businessman, aren’t you?

417
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,830
Tell me,

418
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,880
what did the girl ask you?

419
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,000
Flowers.

420
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,070
She asked me where she could find

421
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,160
the flirtiest man in the world.

422
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,040
And how did you reply her?

423
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,830
Well…

424
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,760
I’ll tell you.

425
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,280
I told her to

426
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,760
go to the Qingguan House.

427
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,710
Come in, handsome.

428
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,880
Come play with us.

429
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,620
[Qingguan House]

430
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,520
Goodbye, Sir. See you later.

431
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,520
Excuse me, Ma’am.

432
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,800
could you please tell me

433
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,190
if this is where

434
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,520
the flirtiest man in the world comes?

435
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,430
Of course.

436
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,230
Our customers here are all flirty to death.

437
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,190
I’ve come to the right place.

438
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,830
Miss,

439
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,710
you can’t go in.

440
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,400
Why not?

441
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,470
We only entertain male guests.

442
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,920
Isn’t it a music house?

443
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,070
Why don’t you entertain women like me?

444
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,830
This is a place

445
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,590
for gentlemen to enjoy the music and dance.

446
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,430
It’s a heaven for men.

447
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,670
But I’m looking for someone.

448
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,830
Who are you looking for?

449
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,710
The flirtiest man in the world.

450
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,560
I am the flirtiest man in the world.

451
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,880
Master, she paid to get the message that

452
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,010
you were the flirtiest man in the world

453
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,750
and was told to come here.

454
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,710
Enough.

455
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,880
What are you doing?

456
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,340
You think I won’t beat you?

457
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,160
Master.

458
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,800
It hurts…

459
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,070
Stop, Mister.

460
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,520
There must be some misunderstandings.

461
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,350
-Get out.
-What are you doing?

462
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,040
Please go in.

463
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,680
Let’s go.

464
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,580
-Thank you, Mister.
-Go away.

465
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,800
Leave. Please leave.

466
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,400
Ma’am,

467
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,800
is there a Shangguan

468
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,880
here in your place?

469
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,800
No.

470
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,310
Then is there a Zhaojun?

471
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,310
No.

472
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,400
Then

473
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
The Shangguan, the Zhaojun.

474
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,230
You know, Ma’am.

475
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,160
Who are you looking for, Miss?

476
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,430
Go away. I’ve still got work to do.

477
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,890
Ma’am, I want the preeminent Shangguan Tou.

478
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,040
Come with me.

479
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,710
Tell me,

480
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,470
what can I help you with?

481
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,230
Why did you save me?

482
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,370
You mean in the Hero Assembly?

483
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,240
That’s nothing. No need to mention it.

484
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,400
But

485
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,560
I see you’ve been keeping the drawing.

486
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,000
The man on it must be

487
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,950
very important to you, right?

488
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,000
Do you know

489
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,880
who the man is?

490
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Of course I do.

491
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,310
It’s you.

492
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,880
See? It’s a true likeness.

493
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,830
Only one with hair and one without.

494
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,920
Little girl,

495
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,000
you’re feisty, aren’t you?

496
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,000
Tell me, how can I help you.

497
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,350
The sound!

498
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,800
You are the man

499
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,530
who saved me in the cave, right?

500
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,080
I don’t understand.

501
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I can tell from the sound of the fan.

502
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,010
Millions of people have a fan in hand.

503
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,310
But

504
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,720
I can also tell from your figure.

505
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
There’re also many skinny people.

506
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,640
Then why did you save nobody else but me

507
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,830
in the Hero Assembly?

508
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,350
Saving someone in danger

509
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,730
will be any righteous man’s cause.

510
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,760
Fine.

511
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,110
You win.

512
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,430
I’ll leave then.

513
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,920
Miss,

514
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,070
this man is that important to you?

515
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,520
You only come to express your gratitude?

516
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,520
That’s none of your business.

517

You said you were not him, didn’t you?

518
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,400
Anyway,

519
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,710
the Hall of Flames is never ingrate.

520
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,310
If you’re not him, I should go.

521
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,190
Master,

522
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,800
you are asked to protect Miss Chong,

523
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,040
then why don’t you tell her you saved her?

524
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
Why do you think

525
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,110
she came up to me?

526
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,470
Normally, girls come up to you

527
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,160
for love affair.

528
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,040
But

529
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,560
she’s an exception.

530
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,960
She said she’s come to express her gratitude?

531
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,960
But, Master,

532
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,880
her eyes were injured then.

533
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,450
How could she know it’s you?

534
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,100
She doesn’t know for sure.

535
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,310
Did she come

536
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,530
for the Nine Moves of Lotus God?

537
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,990
People can’t see things through

538
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,820
because they are too engaged.

539
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,200
You think I can’t tell the truth

540

in the world?

601
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,320
Just because I told you I was not your savior

602
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,230

603

scribble my portraits?

604
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,040
Are you confessing that

you saved me in the cave the other day?

00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,760
Just like you.

691
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,560
If you come here,

692
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,889
then you must have accepted my apologies.

693
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,280
Now that the misunderstanding is solved,

694
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,800
we should say goodbye.

695
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,929
Where are you going?

696
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,360
To where my fate leads me.

697
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,170
We’ll meet again someday.

698
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,120
I can’t let you go.

699
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,630
Why not?

700
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,670
From the sound of your fan,

701
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,670
your figure, and the rice paper,

702
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,670
I can tell that you must be the one

703
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,360
who saved me in the cave the other day.

704
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,710
I might not be a hero,

705
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,150
but I will deliver my promise of expressing my gratitude.

706
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,840
I am happy to see you being grateful to me.

707
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,470
But

708
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,800
how will you show your gratitude?

709
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,390
You told me when in the cave that

710
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,600
you were asked to protect someone.

711
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,360
Yes.

712
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,970
Then this person must mean a lot to you.

713
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,230
Right.

714
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,910
Then I will protect this person for you.

715
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,630
You?

716
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,710
Hey, you may look down on me,

717
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,840
but don’t look down on

718
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,900
the Hall of Flames.

719
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,320
The Hall of Flames is renowned and respectable.

720
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,330
It’s way out of my league to judge.

721
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,080
But

722
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,230
It’s not easy to protect the one

723
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,280
I need to protect.

724
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,000
Besides,

725
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,710
you yourself are in trouble now.

726
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,810
How can you protect others?

727
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,080
That’s true.

728
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,710
Well…

729
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,190
The Nine Moves of Lotus God was missing now

730
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,000
and as the Young Master of the Hall of Flames,

731
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,760
my priority is to locate it.

732
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,230
But I don’t feel right

733
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,120
If I don’t pay you back.

734
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,870
How about this?

735
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
You help me to find

736
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,190
the Nine Moves of Lotus God.

737
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,520
After we solve

738
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,630
the big problems

739
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,760
I’ll help you with your

740
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,120
protection mission.

741
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,910
Deal?

742
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,520
That would sound to be

743
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,630
a reasonable arrangement.

744
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,710
It’s quite good,

745
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,670
but that’s another story.

746
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,550
If I help you find the manual,

747
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,280
that will be another debt you owe me.

748
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,610
How will you pay me back?

749
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,390
Well, if so…

750
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,000
Fine.

751
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I know

752
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
the manual

753
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,360
means a lot to you.

754
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,040
And you do want to pay me back.

755
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,390
I’ll be unreasonable

756
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,390
if I say no.

757
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,800
Then

758
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,360
I’ll just take your advice.

759
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,670
So that’s a yes?

760
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,900
But if I succeed to save you again,

761
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,600
I think I’ll need something

762
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,190
as reward from you.

763
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,280
Whatever you ask.

764
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,870
If we succeed,

765
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,150
I want

766
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,230
something that means most to you.

767
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,910
No problem. I promise you.

768
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,770
Very decisive.

769
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,330
Then let’s make this deal.

770
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,670
Deal.

771
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,120
Wait,

772
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,670
is this my money bag?

773
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,000
Why is it here?

774
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,840
Miss Chong,

775
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,470
you can’t just trust

776
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,670
anyone you meet.

777
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,280
Think it twice

778
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,380
before you decide you believe it.

779
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,360
Now I’ve returned the bag to its owner.

780
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,890
Thank you for your lesson.

781
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,820
Don’t break your promise.

782
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,390
I won’t.

783
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,560
Master,

784
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,410
are we still going to Emei?

785
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,000
To Dongdu.

786
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,780
[Tianbao Inn]

787
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,360
According to my observation,

788
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,230
even the most confidential plan can be leaked.

789
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,960
If you want information,

790
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,040
go to where people gather.

791
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,280
Like

792
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,430
fairs,

793
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,880
music houses,

794
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,150
or taverns.

795
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,950
People there

796
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,630
are resourceful.

797
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,320
If you pay them,

798
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,670
they will even walk around the city

799
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,560
to gather information for you.

800
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,150
Good idea.

801
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,390
But

802
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,950
where should we start?

803
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,760
Let’s work in groups.

804
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,630
OK.

805
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,150
Umbrellas.

806
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,080
Nice and inexpensive umbrellas.

807
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Flowers.

808
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,760
They are beautiful.

809
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,360
They’ve got all colors here.

810
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,080
Osmanthus cakes.

811
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,230
Newly-made osmanthus cakes.

812
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,390
Osmanthus cakes!

813
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,470
Miss.

814
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,470
Osmanthus cakes!

815
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,430
Newly-made.

816
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,870
The new moon is in the sky.

817
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,430
It’s the best time for osmanthus cakes.

818
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,080
Right.

819
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,600
Flowers.

820
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,710
Flowers.

821
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,230
Mister,

822
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,600
I’ll buy all of them.

823
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,260
Thank you, Master Shangguan.

824
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,490
That’s too much.

825
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,230
No.

826
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,120
I’ll buy them all if you like it.

827
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,000
Master Shangguan is our benefactor.

828
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
He’s helped many people.

829
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,420
Just accept them with thanks.

830
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,310
I’ll pack them up for you.

831
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,730
Enjoy the food.

832
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,230
We’ve asked everyone we met.

833
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,840
This is not working.

834
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,040
What should do now?

835
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,910
Liuli, let’s go over there.

836
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,250
Master Shangguan,

837
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,800
why are we here?

838
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,630
We should be looking for the manual, right?

839
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,230
Don’t worry, Miss Chong.

840
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,910
I’ve sent my people to investigate.

841
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,660
They’ll find something soon.

842
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,470
Look at the beautiful lanterns.

843
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,520
Do you know what festival

844
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,040
we are having today?

845
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,150
Today is the Double Seventh Festival.

846
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,600
Girls write their

847
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,390
good wishes on pieces of paper

848
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,460
and let the lanterns take them to the beyond.

849
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,760
Some people also

850
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,670
put their names and their lovers’ names

851
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,910
on the lanterns

852
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,790
in hope that the lanterns

853
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,430
will bring their love

854
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,390
to the loved ones.

855
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,190
Really? I want to make a wish too.

856
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,760
What a coincidence.

857
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,710
I don’t have a river lantern,

858
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,430
But

859
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,630
I have this lantern.

860
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,760
It’s cute.

861
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,510
Do you like it?

862
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,190
I know you were born in the year of rabbit,

863
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,520
so I bought this for you.

864
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,470
How do you know?

865
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,640
By guessing.

866
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,670
Master Shangguan,

867
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,520
how do you manage to

868
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,670
prepare everything in advance.

869
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,040
and guess all things right?

870
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,870
Maybe

871
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,080
it’s fate.

872
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,190
Aren’t you going to make a wish?

873
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,280
What’s your wish?

874
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,910
Right.

875
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,670
I wish that

876
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,280
we can find the Nine Moves of Lotus God soon.

877
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,800
That the Hall of Flames will rise again.

878
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,040
And that I can compensate for all my father’s mistakes.

879
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,870
-That…
-Miss Chong,

880
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,280
if you make too many wishes,

881
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,540
they may not come true.

882
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,360
Also,

883
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,150
why don’t you ask me

884
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:21,840
who exactly

885
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,080
I need to protect?

886
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,670
Because you said that’s someone I didn’t know.

887
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,760
Why bother?

888
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:32,230
I can tell you now.

889
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,450
The one I need to protect

890
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,230
is…
