Episode 29

4
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Tou.

5
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,270
Where are you?

6
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,829
How

7
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,600
have you been doing?

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
How come I feel that I saw something?

9
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,000
Was that an illusion?

10
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,030
Yin Ci.

11
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,250
Tou’s injury isn’t serious, is it?

12
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
Well,

13
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,570
you should ask the Leader.

14
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,600
He did it so recklessly,

15
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,410
the wound was deep, of course.

16
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,160
Luckily, you met me.

17
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,960
Thank you.

18
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,970
Thank you, sir.

19
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,110
Take care.

20
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,390
Mr. Lin.

21
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,480
In a few days,

22
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,930
I’ll go to the Winehouse of Fairyland.

23
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,230
Why will you go there?

24
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,470
I have no idea

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,260
what Lord Lu and Feng Cheng

26
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,470
were plotting,

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,880
but I do think it takes a long time.

28
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,290
Wuming is watching over Huashan Sect for me.

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
I’ll go to the Winehouse of Fairyland

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,390
and see if I can get some clues

31
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,630
from the messages over these years.

32
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,270
But you just recovered.

33
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,450
Rest assured, sir.

34
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,750
My inner injury has recovered.

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,470
It’s fine.

36
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,600
Alright.

37
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,190
Be very careful.

38

[Winehouse of Fairyland]

39
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,080
In 1516,

40
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,090
800 troops were deployed.

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,530
In the next year,

42
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,550
500 troops were deployed

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,519
in the name of flood control.

44
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,440
Leader.

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,880
Is this a new hairpin?

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,110
It looks beautiful.

47
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,480
It’s a gift from Muyuan.

48
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,750
Chief Guardian is so kind to you.

49
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,510
Leader.

50
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,270
What do you

51
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,070
think of him?

52
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,600
He is good.

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,010
That's not what I’m asking.

54
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,510
All the people in our sect,

55
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,480
even that blockhead Chequ, can see

56
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
Chief Guardian likes you.

57
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,760
Really?

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
Of course.

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,390
Well,

60
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,230
what do you think of him?

61
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,530
Haven’t you ever considered him?

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
I do think

63
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,000
he is a good man.

64
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,070
Master Shangguan is good, too.

65
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,230
But he is

66
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,070
too ambiguous,

67
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,640
not like Chief Guardian

68
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,160
whom we grow up together with

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,420
and know him very well.

70
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,110
This time,

71
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,670
he risked his life again

72
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,510
and saved you from Huashan Sect.

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,950
He is so reliable.

74
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,480
I think

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
the affection

76
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,770
is indeed important for lovers

77
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,510
to live together all the life.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,600
But

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,480
isn’t it more important

80
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,510
to marry someone who is reliable

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,760
and trustworthy?

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
For so many years,

83
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,480
no matter what happened to you,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
Chief Guardian was always by your side.

85
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,480
It wasn’t that easy.

86
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,830
Let me ask you.

87
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,440
You choose to be with Chequ.

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Is it because you like him

89
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
or

90
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,600
he is more reliable?

91
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,110
I... That’s because

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
he’s stupid.

93
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,880
Chief Guardian.

94
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
You’re here.

95
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,400
What’s on your mind?

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
I  promised Xuezhi

97
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,580
I’d restore the Hall of Flames

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,760
within three years.

99
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,390
But now

100
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
nearly two years have passed.

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,610
The Hall of Flames doesn’t get better.

102
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,140
Instead, it’s been through the wringer,

103
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,050
and nearly destroyed by Huashan Sect.

104
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,320
Chequ.

105
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,920
If

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,270
you want to protect someone all your life,

107
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,760
what will you do?

108
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,810
Zhusha is the one I want to protect.

109
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
I’ll marry her

110
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
and take care of her forever.

111
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,000
Chief Guardian.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,659
The one you want to protect

113
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,710
is the Leader, right?

114
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,480
Yes it is.

115
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,720
Even a blockhead like you can see it.

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,480
Why can’t she?

117
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,920
800.

118
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,600
500.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,790
Tou.

120
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,040
What are you doing?

121
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,520
These flags are...

122
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,549
1,200.

123
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,980
It’s about the deployment

124
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,640
of troops by Lord Lu to the court these years.

125
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,710
Any problem?

126
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,590
Separately,

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
there’s nothing wrong.

128
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,130
Just some common deployments.

129
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,760
Also,

130
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,790
Lord Lu isn’t the crown prince.

131
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,000
So, the deployed troops each time were limited,

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
which didn’t arouse suspicion.

133
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,550
However,

134
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,400
in 1516,

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,320
Lord Lu deployed 800 troops in Xiangzhou.

136
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,230
Xiangzhou?

137
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,440
It’s Lord Lu’s domain.

138
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,960
Isn’t it normal?

139
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,640
Yes.

140
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,000
However,

141
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,880
just after two months,

142
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,630
in the name of flood control,

143
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,880
he deployed these 800 troops to Huayin,

144
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,710
the current domain of Huashan Sect.

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,110
Huashan Sect?

146
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,110
More than that.

147
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,650
In the second year,

148
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,760
Lord Lu sent 500 troops to garrison Emei.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,640
Last year,

150
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,790
he sent 1,200 troops

151
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,640
to garrison Mount Suozi of Shangqing Sect.

152
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,910
Just within three years,

153
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,470
nearly all the sects

154
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
are garrisoned by imperial troops.

155
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,230
Could it be just a coincidence?

156
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,590
You mean

157
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,000
Lord Lu

158
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,520
sends troops to keep an eye on all sects?

159
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,280
But why does he do this?

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,920
The court and the sects are non-interference.

161
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,400
Non-interference?

162
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,400
Lord Lu may not think so.

163
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,260
Your Highness.

164
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,290
What’s the matter?

165
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,670
The Chief of Huashan Sect,

166
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,790
Feng Mo, comes to see you.

167
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,030
Feng Mo?

168
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,110
Let him in.

169
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes.

170
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,540
I’m the Chief of Huashan Sect.

171
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,630
My respects, Your Highness.

172
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,050
The Chief of Huashan Sect?

173
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,230
Who sent you here?

174
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,970
Your Highness.

175
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
I paid the visit abruptly,

176
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,400
lacking in manners.

177
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,520
Please forgive me.

178
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,600
Answer my question.

179
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,350
Who sent you here?

180
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,620
Your Highness.

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,640
My father was killed by Yuwen Muyuan.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,330
I want to carry on my father’s will,

183
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,960
and continue serving you,

184
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,840
wiping out the Hall of Flames

185
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,350
to avenge my father's death.

186
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,030
Idiot!

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,470
Feng Cheng was an idiot!

188
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
I warned him

189
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,400
not to let anyone else know this,

190
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
yet he still leaked it out.

191
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
Wasn’t he an idiot?

192
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,140
Sorry, Your Highness.

193
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,350
The thing you ordered my father to do

194
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,280
was done by us together.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
No one else

196
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
except for us knows it.

197
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,970
Although my father is dead,

198
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,050
your course cannot be delayed.

199
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,340
I succeeded him as the Chief of Huashan Sect.

200
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,440
I’d like to serve Your Highness

201
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,880
and help you complete the plan.

202
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,670
Chief Feng.

203
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,750
Is your father’s funeral

204
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,280
properly handled?

205
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,350
Thanks for your concern, Your Highness.

206
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,640
It’s all set.

207
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,640
My father

208
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,280
was already buried.

209
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,000
I’m relieved then.

210
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,000
I’m sorry

211
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,870
for your father’s death.

212
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
Since you’re sincere,

213
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I’ll give you a task,

214
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,080
which

215
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,640
can also

216
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,510
avenge your father’s death.

217
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,910
Pastries!

218
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,520
Muyuan.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,110
I’m hungry.

220
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,760
Hungry?

221
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,640
What

222
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,760
should we eat?

223
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,370
What would you like to eat?

224
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,410
Hello, would you like some cakes?

225
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,180
Hello, what would you like to eat?

226
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,280
These are mung bean cakes.

227
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,150
These are osmanthus cakes.

228
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,280
These are almond cakes.

229
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
Fresh osmanthus cakes!

230
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,080
Osmanthus cakes!

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,590
Hello.

232
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,710
Osmanthus cakes.

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Osmanthus cakes.

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,350
They're just out of the oven.

235
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,470
It’s the first day of the month.

236
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,110
Osmanthus cakes are the best.

237
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:11,760
Yeah.

238
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,640
Sir.

239
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,200
I’ll take them all.

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,530
Yes, Master Shangguan.

241
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,000
Xuezhi.

242
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,030
Xuezhi.

243
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,550
Which kind?

244
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,200
Sir.

245
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,030
Wrap them all.

246
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,640
Sure. Wait a moment.

247
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,230
Eat slowly.

248
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,350
No hurry.

249
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,480
Xuezhi, do you remember

250
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,410
when I just came to the Hall of Flames,

251
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
my godfather introduced you to me

252
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,910
and let me take good care of you?

253
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,000
Of course I do.

254
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,440
You called me

255
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,590
Xuezhi like this.

256
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,030
You’ve been taking care of me.

257
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,030
Yes.

258
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
But I don't think

259
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,350
I’m doing well.

260
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,440
I always think

261
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,790
no matter what kind of danger you’re in,

262
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,910
I can come to you

263
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,080
right away

264
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,670
and protect you.

265
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,110
But this time

266
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
I was really scared.

267
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,790
Well,

268
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,080
it’s also you who saved me this time.

269
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
Feng Cheng is already dead.

270
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,570
What if there were other enemies?

271
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,790
Now

272
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,280
I couldn’t take it

273
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,150
if anyone hurt you

274
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,000
by any means.

275
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,200
Muyuan.

276
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,030
I know you see it as your duty to protect me

277
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,760
and the sect.

278
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,670
But...

279
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,400
I’m not talking about the sect.

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,260
I'm talking about you.

281
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,670
I know

282
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,670
in your heart,

283
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,810
I’m just like your brother

284
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,280
who takes care of you

285
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,710
and protects you.

286
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Or

287
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
you think everything I do

288
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,210
is all because I’m Chief Guardian.

289
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,230
But Xuezhi, think about it.

290
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,850
We grew up together since childhood,

291
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,990
practicing martial arts

292
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,750
and living together.

293
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,150
Now we’re grown-ups.

294
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,350
I’ve never mentioned

295
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,640
some things to you,

296
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,790
but it doesn’t mean

297
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,690
I’ve never thought about them.

298
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,320
Muyuan.

299
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Back then,

300
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,790
I protected you

301
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
as your brother.

302
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,230
But from now on,

303
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,880
I hope I can protect you for life

304
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,710
In another role.

305
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,000
May I?

306
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,350
I...

307
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,080
Of course.

308
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,150
There's no rush to answer me.

309
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,670
Because I know

310
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,320
you still

311
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,670
can't forget him.

312
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,880
You need more time.

313
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,760
I mean

314
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,000
whether you agree or not,

315
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,430
just tell me when you

316
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,829
are ready.

317
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
Actually,

318
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,230
I want to forget him, too.

319
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,109
But

320
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,950
I find

321
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,350
I cannot do it.

322
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,710
I can’t take it that

323
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,190
he's never been in my life.

324
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,230
So, Muyuan,

325
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,760
perhaps I need more time.

326
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,560
I understand.

327
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,760
Actually,

328
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
I don’t mean for you to

329
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,230
forget him.

330
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,760
You shouldn’t do that.

331
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,760
I just don’t hope

332
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,490
you won’t be longing for him in the future.

333
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,230
Xuezhi. Remember.

334
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,000
Whatever

335
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,430
you missed before,

336
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,000
you have to face

337
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,520
To have a future life.

338
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,640
Muyuan.

339
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,310
You know.

340
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,190
He is

341
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,830
very unusual

342
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,590
He doesn’t have me in his heart,

343
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,610
yet he’s reluctant to let me go.

344
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,350
Yes.

345
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
But for someone,

346
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,140
What’s even stranger.

347
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,270
Is that he does have you in all his heart,

348
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,430
yet he can’t have you.

349
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,230
Tou.

350
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,760
You’ve looked at the chessboard for two days.

351
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,930
Did you fell in love with it?

352
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,040
Hongxiu.

353
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,110
Do you know chess?

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,640
Those from the Winehouse of Fairyland

355
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
are well-rounded in talents.

356
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,430
But

357
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,400
looking at the board while not placing pieces,

358
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,590
I just don’t get that

359
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,690
I want to place pieces, too.

360
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
But I don’t know where to place them.

361
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,360
It depends on where the opponent will.

362
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,310
The piece

363
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,650
placed by the opponent is invisible.

364
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,230
If it’s a game with Lord Lu,

365
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,760
don’t guess where his pieces will be.

366
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,540
You need to place ahead of him.

367
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,040
Humans

368
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,000
all have fatal weakness.

369
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,040
If none of you act,

370
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,070
how can you play the game?

371
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,710
So, I think

372
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,640
you might as well

373
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,350
place a piece first

374
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,160
and lead him out.

375
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,190
Take the initiative.

376
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,190
The way of your playing

377
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,190
is indeed a good strategy.

378
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,520
I’m not as tricky as you are.

379
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,230
How is it?

380
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
Is it

381
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,430
helpful to you?

382
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,480
Of course.

383
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,960
Thank you, Hongxiu.

384
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,470
Then tell me.

385
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,890
How is it going between Xuezhi and you?

386
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,950
Xuezhi and I

387
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,630
are just parted temporarily to let things settle.

388
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,910
You’ve been parted for too long.

389
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,830
I tried so hard

390
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,950
to persuade her to listen to your explanation.

391
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,160
Did you explain?

392
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,880
I didn’t get an appropriate chance.

393
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,110
Tou, you’re so foolish.

394
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,350
You're always stalling.

395
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,040
Can’t you see

396
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,680
Chief Guardian Muyuan’s mind

397
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,310
on Xuezhi?

398
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,490
Xuezhi is in danger currently.

399
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,780
She goes back to the Hall of Flames

400
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,750
and has Chief Guardian with her.

401
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,190
At least she's safe.

402
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,190
As for her and me,

403
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,110
it’s no hurry.

404
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,070
I'm reminding you

405
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
tons of things happened to Xuezhi lately.

406
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,190
Her mind has changed.

407
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,880
If you continue doing nothing,

408
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,230
no one knows

409
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,370
what will happen in the future.

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,590
Hongxiu.

411
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,900
All in all, Xuezhi being in danger

412
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,310
in Huashan was all because of me.

413
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Hadn’t Zheng invited her to Dongdu,

414
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,680
it wouldn’t have been

415
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,520
such a mess.

416
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,710
By the banquet, Lord Lu tried to

417
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,760
subdue the sects in the name of mediation.

418
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,280
Xuezhi is highly self-esteemed.

419
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,430
She rejected Lord Lu in public.

420
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,230
I’m afraid Lord Lu bears a grudge

421
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,860
and will do harm to Xuezhi.

422
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,830
Besides,

423
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,590
I’ve always felt

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
Lord Lu pays much attention to Hall of Flames.

425
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,310
Once I think of someone targets Xuezhi,

426
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
I feel really uneasy.

427
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,040
When I find out Lord Lu’s true colors,

428
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,830
I’ll go to her right away

429
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,800
and tell her everything.

430
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,160
Tou.

431
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,160
Are you afraid?

432
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,230
How so?

433
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,080
You’ve been separated from her for so long.

434
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,560
You’re afraid

435
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,400
another man will replace you in her heart.

436
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,230
I believe in Xuezhi

437
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,230
and our love.

438
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,530
Alright. Alright.

439
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
Take care.

440
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,470
Life is short.

441
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,070
Don’t just focus on the future

442
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
but miss the present.

443
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,920
I’m leaving.

444
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,650
Master Shangguan.

445
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,160
Wuming.

446
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
Aren’t you in Xiangzhou?

447
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,120
How come you’re here?

448
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,160
Master Shangguan.

449
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,560
Feng Mo visited Lord Lu.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,330
Feng Cheng colluded with Lord Lu long ago.

451
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,920
Now Feng Cheng is dead.

452
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,430
Feng Mo is young and takes over Huashan.

453
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,690
Badly, with poor foundation,
he has no one to rely on.

454
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,840
It’s reasonable to seek protection from Lord Lu.

455
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,800
It’s just that

456
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,110
I didn’t expect he’d act so fast.

457
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,190
Yeah.

458
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,400
Feng Cheng just died.

459
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,230
Feng Mo carried on his father’s will

460
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,690
and got a powerful backup.

461
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,160
Like father, like son.

462
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,740
What else did you find out?

463
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,350
I didn’t get

464
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,710
the details of their talk,

465
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,590
but

466
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,590
Feng Mo looked relaxed and had a good mood

467
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,490
when he came out of the mansion.

468
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,490
If that’s the case,

469
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,160
Feng Mo might’ve made an agreement

470
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,590
with Lord Lu.

471
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,180
They may act very soon.

472
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,310
Did Feng Mo have any gift with him

473
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,170
when he came out from the mansion?

474
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,760
No.

475
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,590
He went with only a dagger.

476
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,010
So did he when he was out.

477
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,280
Feng Mo had no manners,

478
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,590
even taking a dagger into the mansion.

479
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,310
Yeah.

480
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
I don’t understand, either.

481
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,520
Master Shangguan.

482
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
What should we do next?

483
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,520
If I were Lord Lu,

484
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,310
my domain Xiangzhou

485
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,620
was away from the prosperous Dongdu.

486
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,140
I never associated with nobles in court,

487
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,950
or fought with princes.

488
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,800
I were fragile,

489
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,640
so I strengthened my body through martial arts.

490
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,310
However, I didn’t achieve my course.

491
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,470
I favored laws,

492
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,040
believing the court and sects are all emperor’s.

493
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,400
All the sects shall stick to rules.

494
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,710
I deployed troops

495
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,040
in all sects’ domain several times

496
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,520
flawlessly.

497
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,120
I saw the Hall of Flames fight against Huashan

498
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,830
and became the final winner.

499
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,110
I traded with Feng Mo after Feng Cheng died.

500
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,430
As a lord,

501
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,950
I could give Feng Mo glory and wealth.

502
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,070
But Feng Mo is a commoner.

503
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,560
What can he give me back?

504
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,400
Yeah.

505
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,040
What can Feng Mo give Lord Lu?

506
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,830
Promising to kill someone

507
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,430
like Feng Cheng did.

508
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,920
Wuming.

509
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Let me ask you.

510
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,310
Whom will Feng Mo

511
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,770
avenge against for his father?

512
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,490
It must be Yuwen Muyuan.

513
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,090
I don’t think so.

514
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,560
Feng Cheng was killed by Muyuan.

515
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,040
But all in all,

516
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,520
his death

517
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,040
had something to with the Hall of Flames.

518
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,230
Think about it.

519
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,430
Chong Ye created the Nine Moves of Lotus God

520
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,090
and killed the old Chief Feng.

521
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,560
They’ve held a feud since then.

522
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,190
Xuezhi destroyed the Nine Moves in public

523
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,800
and Lotus Wing perished.

524
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,040
Xuezhi came back from the seclusion

525
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,560
and settled the epidemic,

526
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,230
and the Hall of Flames got to thrive.

527
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,350
Feng Cheng

528
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,310
was unable to resist alone,

529
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,880
so, sought help from the government.

530
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,570
Unexpectedly, he failed and got killed,

531
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,800
leaving a useless Feng Mo.

532
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,760
Why did Feng Mo seek help from Lord Lu

533
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,370
to avenge against the Hall of Flames?

534
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,920
Lord Lu and the Hall of Flames

535
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,520
have never had any grudge.

536
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,760
How come he got involved in this?

537
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,880
Perhaps he doesn’t only want the Hall of Flames,

538
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,730
but all the sects in the world.

539
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,220
[Imperial Advisor’s Mansion]

540
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,280
Father.

541
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,640
I found something in the Winehouse of Fairyland

542
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,710
which may concern Lord Lu.

543
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,160
Second prince?

544
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,680
Yes.

545
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,430
Do you remember I ever said

546
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,710
the culprit behind Man Feiyue and Feng Cheng

547
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
could be the same person?

548
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,310
I suspect it is Lord Lu.

549
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,470
Any evidence?

550
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,410
In the Winehouse of Fairyland, I found

551
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,760
Lord Lu has been deploying troops

552
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,880
into all sects by various names

553
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,520
over these years.

554
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,400
I think

555
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,310
he’s watching over the moves of all sects.

556
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,160
Tou.

557
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,800
I divined

558
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,900
with divinatory trigrams the other day,

559
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
which showed

560
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,920
the fishes died

561
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,520
in the turbulent water.

562
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,280
The trigram result was so weird.

563
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,560
Father, you said before

564
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,640
the court was water.

565
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,310
The sects were fishes in it.

566
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,680
Does the trigram show

567
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,520
the water of court will be turbulent

568
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,370
and the sects will suffer a disaster?

569
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,070
If Lord Lu really intended to

570
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,160
stir the water up as you said,

571
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,310
that would be a disaster indeed.

572
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:02,150
Huashan Sect raided the Hall of Flames.

573
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,160
The century-old legacy of the Hall of Flames

574
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,820
was nearly ruined overnight.

575
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,160
Huashan Sect lost their chief as well.

576
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,190
Just within one month,

577
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,090
the two large sects were greatly undermined.

578
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,920
If it’s really plotted by Lord Lu, he meant to

579
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,710
let all sects fight against each other

580
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,640
to be the final winner.

581
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,280
If he isn’t stopped,

582
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I’m wondering he will do

583
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,020
more horrible things.

584
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,680
Tou.

585
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,760
You’re not an official.

586
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,280
Moon Valley is secluded from the world.

587
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,310
You should stay out of this.

588
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,190
I will

589
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,230
have a talk with Lord Lu.

590
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,070
Father.

591
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,460
You're the Imperial Advisor.

592
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,520
Is it appropriate

593
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,580
to visit Lord Lu in Xiangzhou?

594
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,600
His Majesty will issue new taxation policies.

595
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,000
Household Ministry is in charge of taxation,

596
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,860
which can be a reason for my visit.

597
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,430
By the name of public business,

598
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,430
I don’t think it will arouse gossip.

599
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,710
I’ll go with you, father.

600
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I can visit my sister as well.

601
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,310
Sure.

602
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,880
Tou.

603
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,680
Zheng is your sister,

604
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,430
your family.

605
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,520
If I’m gone someday,

606
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,160
you should take care of each other.

607
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,310
Father, what are you talking about?

608
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,160
You’ll see me get married and have kids.

609
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,230
Tou.

610
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,470
Promise me.

611
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,310
Yes.

612
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,690
I promise you, father.

[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

614
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,360
You’ve never come to Xiangzhou.

615
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,020
Now that you pay me a visit,

616
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,470
there must be something.

617
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,710
His Majesty intends to reform the taxation

618
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,190
and promote new policies.

619
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,230
It’s my obligation.

620
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,640
Imperial Advisor, you fancy

621
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,230
my small city, right?

622
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,560
You're modest, Lord Lu.

623
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,530
Xiangzhou might be a small city originally.

624
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,600
But under your governance,

625
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
the politics are well ordered.

626
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,710
People lead a wealthy and happy life.

627
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,730
It’s my father’s will.

628
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,710
I’ll do my utmost to cooperate.

629
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,070
But at politics, I’m not

630
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,400
as good as you.

631
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,070
New taxation policy concerns livelihood.

632
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,560
Please do it in my stead.

633
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,950
I may have more time to accompany Zheng.

634
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,890
You don’t struggle for power.

635
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,470
Everyone knows that.

636
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,710
I’ll tell His Majesty.

637
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
That isn’t true.

638
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,400
Actually,

639
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,330
I want to take it myself.

640
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,710
Take what, Your Highness?

641
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,680
It’s simple, actually.

642
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,400
Cast food into the fishpond,

643
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,160
and the fishes will come in swarms

644
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
for food.

645
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,520
I don’t think

646
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,590
people are like fish.

647
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,070
Fish are animals,

648
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,880
and have no sense of good or evil,

649
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,590
just seeking for food

650
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,830
to survive.

651
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,350
Lord Lu feeds them food.

652
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,190
They’ll surround you definitely.

653
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,070
I don’t agree with you, Imperial Advisor.

654
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,160
I don’t think

655
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,110
fish and humans

656
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,430
have many differences.

657
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,430
They are both greedy and filthy by nature.

658
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,470
If

659
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,000
there’s no pond restricting them,

660
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,880
do you think

661
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,350
they will give in?

662
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,520
So are the humans.

663
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,520
No rules,

664
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,880
nothing can be done.

665
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,280
Lord Lu, do you want to

666
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,080
apply the rules of the fishpond

667
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,470
to the sects?

668
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,160
Why not?

669
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,710
There were no sects

670
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,110
in the world originally,

671
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,920
which were just set up by commoners

672
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,950
to shelter themselves in wartime.

673
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,640
Now that the world is in peace,

674
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,390
the existence of sects is unnecessary.

675
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,070
I’m afraid

676
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,520
if they continue developing,

677
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,100
the peaceful world

678
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,830
will be threatened.

679
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,080
Your highness, as you think...

680
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,760
All the land belongs to the emperor.

681
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,070
All the people

682
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,110
are the subjects of the emperor.

683
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,560
The government should  have destroyed

684
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
these boorish people long ago.

685
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,110
Looks like

686
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,070
you’ve already decided on it

687
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,740
You’re my father-in-law.

688
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,830
Are you willing

689
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,760
to join me?

690
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,830
I prefer

691
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,230
the life like a fish in the wild pond,

692
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,449
enjoying the freedom,

693
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,360
not being controlled or subject to others.

694
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,670
That’s pleasing.

695
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,190
You’re not fish.

696
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,020
How do you know fishes’ life is miserable

697
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,760
or happy?

698
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,659
Never mind.

699
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,679
We all have aspirations.

700
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,239
Since you’re reluctant,

701
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,870
I won’t force you.

702
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,120
How is it going?

703
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,870
How is Miss Chong?

704
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,540
Rest assured, sister.

705
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,630
I come here

706
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,040
to especially tell you about it.

707
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,040
Xuezhi

708
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,840
is all right now.

709
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,840
Yuwen Muyuan killed Feng Cheng,

710
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,520
and took her back to the Hall of Flames.

711
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,280
That’s good.

712
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,280
Feng Cheng

713
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,840
deserved his death.

714
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,190
I was worried

715
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,450
if something went wrong with Miss Chong,

716
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,850
you wouldn’t recognize me as your sister.

717
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,910
What are you talking about, sister?

718
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,710
I know

719
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,600
you’re kind to me.

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,630
Tou.

721
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,630
That day in Dongdu, I could see

722
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,810
Chief Guardian Muyuan cared about Xuezhi a lot.

723
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,120
He guarded against us.

724
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,840
Yuwen Muyuan and Xuezhi grew up together.

725
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,320
They are

726
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,520
like friends and also siblings.

727
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,140
They’re intimate.

728
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,000
But it’s different from your affections with her.

729
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,520
At the banquet that day,

730
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:42,670
you protected her cautiously.

731
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,390
All the people had seen that clearly.

732
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,120
But

733
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,090
they couldn’t necessarily sense

734
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,280
she also cared about you.

735
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,910
What do you mean?

736
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,190
She was caring about you,

737
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
so she didn’t allow you to chase her.

738
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,320
Because she clearly knew

739
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,150
she didn’t drink Lie’s wine

740
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,710
and had a beef with him.

741
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,870
If you went out after her,

742
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,670
that would make me

743
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,280
and your brother-in-law embarrassed.

744
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,120
Tou.

745
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,710
The love between you

746
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,040
is clearly seen by outsiders.

747
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,520
Not to mention Chief Guardian,

748
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,760
even hundreds and thousands of guardians

749
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,840
can never change

750
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,520
your love to each other.

751
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,470
So, stop hesitating.

752
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,920
Go to see Miss Chong right away.

753
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,950
Love can afford being tested,

754
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,800
but not humanity.

755
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,600
So, you should let her know

756
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,670
all you have done to her.

757
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,560
Although your affections are deep,

758
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,720
she will become indifferent

759
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,000
over time.

760
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,760
Your Highness.

761
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,080
I heard from the guard

762
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,740
that Imperial Advisor comes.

763
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,040
Father is here.

764
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,540
Why didn’t you tell me?

765
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,600
Father has

766
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,000
important issues to discuss with Lord Lu.

767
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,360
So, I didn’t tell you.

768
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,800
Where is he?

769
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,230
He’s talking with His Highness.

770
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,430
How long will you stay?

771
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,890
Father is busy in the court.

772
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,550
We’re leaving in a while.

773
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,800
Then I should

774
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,520
go to see father right now.

775
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,080
Sure.

776
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,190
The scene

777
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,320
makes me think of

778
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,360
an old story about chess.

779
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,750
Wang Zhi watched the chess game.

780
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,310
Before one game was over,

781
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,770
his new axe was already rotten.

782
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,040
He returned home

783
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,320
and found it had been a century.

784
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,560
Family and friends were all dead.

785
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,710
That must be the saddest story in the world.

786
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,840
Joy and sorrow of life

787
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,120
is in a game.

788
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,490
Things changed while not being noticed.

789
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,390
He forgotten the worries.

790
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,390
If I were Wang Zhi,

791
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,930
I would feel lucky to watch such a game.

792
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,630
Watching a game

793
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,950
is better than being with family for a century?

794
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,040
It depends.

795
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,000
If you’re asking me

796
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,330
as Shangguan Xingzhou,

797
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,470
I’d choose

798
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,390
to be with family.

799
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,820
If you’re asking me as Imperial Advisor,

800
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,710
who else would be in the game

801
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,910
if not me?

802
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,630
I’m wondering

803
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,320
the one standing before me

804
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,800
is my father-in-law

805
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,390
or the Imperial Advisor?

806
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,210
Accounts received.

807
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,360
Excuse me, Your Highness.

808
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,420
Imperial Advisor.

809
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,950
I do feel Tou is really

810
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,150
like you.

811
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,080
Tou is Zheng’s brother.

812
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,840
He looks like Zheng as well.

813
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,770
That’s for sure.

814
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:44,040
Tou and Zheng are both

815
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,280
like you.

816
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,760
I believe

817
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,940
you will treat Zheng well always.

818
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,580
Excuse me, Your Highness.

819
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,710
Please.

820
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,390
Father.

821
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,910
Zheng.

822
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,870
I was discussing politics with Lord Lu.

823
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,380
I couldn’t talk to you.

824
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Why do you look unhappy?

825
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,950
Did His Highness anger you?

826
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,470
Not at all. Zheng.

827
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,560
Don’t think too much.

828
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,520
Tou.

829
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,680
Have you finished your talk with your sister?

830
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,470
Zheng.

831
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,320
I have to get back to Dongdu quickly.

832
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
I’ll see you next time when I’m free.

833
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,460
Pardon me, Your Highness.

834
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,190
What did Imperial Advisor come for?

835
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,670
I think

836
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,190
he intended to sever the ties with me

837
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,000
on behalf of Shangguan family.

838
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,870
Given Master Shangguan’s tie
with the Hall of Flames,

839
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,200
it’s really hard to handle.

840
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,600
My father-in-law.

841
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,940
If you wouldn’t go against me,

842
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,470
our family

843
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,880
would be in perfect harmony.

844
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,430
Please think twice, Your Highness.

845
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,820
Imperial Advisor is the pillar of the state,

846
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,050
the right-hand man of His Majesty.

847
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,280
He tutored the crown prince.

848
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,840
His daughter is your wife.

849
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,430
If you hurt him,

850
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,760
perhaps

851
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,910
it will be rumored by people that you provoke

852
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:53,710
the crown prince or His Majesty.

853
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,190
How dare you!

854
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,000
You are my advisor.

855
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,470
How dare you offend

856
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,630
and lecture me!

857
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,190
I dare not.

858
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,950
It’s just because

859
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,760
Imperial Advisor is deeply rooted in the court.

860
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,820
I hope Your Highness can be discreet.

861
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,430
Deeply rooted?

862
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,400
Can you tell me

863
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,430
where his roots are?

864
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,390
The whole world

865
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,600
belongs to the emperor.
