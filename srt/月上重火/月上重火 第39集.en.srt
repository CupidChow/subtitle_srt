[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 39

4
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,850
Mr. Lin, you didn’t finish your word just now.

5
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
For what matter did you gather us here

6
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
at the Sword Manor?

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
Everyone,

8
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
I invited you

9
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
here today

10
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,850
because I have an announcement

11
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,380
from His Highness to make.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We will establish a Sects Alliance.

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
Establish a Sects Alliance?

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Heroes,

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,960
the martial arts world has existed

16
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,880
for over a hundred years
ever since the Warring States Period.

17
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,280
Everything in this world

18
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,420
comes together at some point.

19
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,380
But the martial arts world

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,120
has never been

21
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
united.

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,220
I found the martial arts world

23
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,080
always full of

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
blood and slaughter.

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,560
I hope we can

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,120
work together

27
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,120
and live in harmony.

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,600
What do

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
you think of

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
my idea?

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,560
Your Highness,

32
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,120
this is a wise

33
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,010
and righteous move.

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,760
We should have

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
long ago worked together.

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,560
If we weren’t that scattered,

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,850
scum like Chong Ye would not

38
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,180
have killed so many martial arts heroes.

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,520
And the Hall of Flames

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,320
would not have done harm
to the martial arts world.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,650
If joining the alliance

42
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,280
helps in protecting the martial arts world,

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,410
we, the Huashan Sect

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,850
will be the first one to say yes.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,800
I want to join, too.

46
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
I also want to join.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,960
Do you think he’s reliable?

48
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,020
I want to join, too.

49
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,580
I also want to join.

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,400
The Emei Sect never stirs up trouble.

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,960
But if it’s for the harmony
of the martial arts world,

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,120
we will

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
never say no to the responsibility.

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Priest Xingyi

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
and Abbot Shiyan,

56
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,320
what are your opinions

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,680
about the establishment

58
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080
of the alliance?

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,159
Merciful Buddha.

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
I am a Buddhist monk

61
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,480
and I certainly uphold mercy.

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
However,

63
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,210
the establishment of the alliance

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
concerns

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,060
the whole martial arts world.

66
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,480
We would need some time

67
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,520
for discussion.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
Your Highness,

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,480
I believe that you mean good

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
by this proposition.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,640
It’s just that the other day

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,960
I heard some rumors

73
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,120
about the Hall of Flames.

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
It’s said that

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
the Hall of Flames was closed

76
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
due to the conspiracy by Lord Lu
and the Huashan Sect.

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Is this true?

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
That’s mere slander!

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,040
They have no evidence at all!

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
I can prove this.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
Shangguan Tou.

82
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
What’s he doing here?

83
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,320
Mr. Lin.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Everyone,

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
I am the Leader

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,520
of the Moon Valley, Shangguan Tou.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
Shangguan Tou,

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,880
what are you doing here

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,970
at the meeting of the leaders of all sects?

90
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,760
True that I was not invited,

91
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
but as the Leader of the Moon Valley,

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,970
I certainly have the right
to join you in the meeting.

93
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,050
Don’t you think,

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,040
Mr. Lin?

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,380
Shangguan Tou,

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,450
you are not welcomed here at the Manor.

97
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
Please leave.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,760
Wait.

99
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,920
I would love to hear

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,210
how you’d defend yourself.

101
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
Do you remember the flu months ago?

102
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,840
We all know

103
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,010
that it was Man Feiyue who spread the disease.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,900
But after investigation,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,730
I found that the one behind this

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
was you, Lord Lu.

107
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
You have long wanted to

108
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
rule the martial arts world.

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
At the beginning,

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,720
he tried to draw the Hall of Flames over,

111
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,480
but was rejected.

112
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
Then

113
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
he colluded with the previous chief

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,200
of Huashan Sect,

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
Feng Cheng,

116
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,490
to set up the Hall of Flames.

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,520
-Is that true?
-Really?

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,880
You won’t forget about this,

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
right,

120
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,890
Chief Guardian Muyuan?

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
That’s right.

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,200
He did approach me once.

123
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,770
But I was too short-sighted

124
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,080
to understand His Highness’s plan.

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,570
Thus I led the Hall of Flames

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,280
to a dead end.

127
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,820
The shutdown of the Hall of Flames

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,450
has nothing to do with His Highness

129
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,120
or anyone else.

130
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,920
You all

131
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,880
hear what

132
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Chief Guardian Muyuan said, right?

133
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,960
Tou,

134
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
you hear that.

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Lord Lu,

136
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
then how will you explain

137
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,240
the death of the Imperial Advisor?

138
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
You killed my father

139
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,080
for unjust charge

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
simply because

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,560
you got angry

142
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,090
after I interfered with your plan many times?

143
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Shangguan Tou,

144
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,520
your father was sentenced to death

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,050
because he was proved to

146
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
have colluded with the rebels.

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
How dare you

148
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,360
slander His Highness?

149
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,400
Shangguan Tou,

150
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,090
Imperial Advisor is not only your father,

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,890
but also my father-in-law.

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,640
All I want is to protect him.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,080
How could I

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,760
do harm to him?

155
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
That’s right.

156
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,000
You can go so far to kill your father-in-law.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,930
There’s nothing you won’t do then.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,600
Guys,

159
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,640
please don’t forget

160
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
what happened to the Hall of Flames.

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,440
Because

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,160
you may also end up

163
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,480
in the same way.

164
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Everyone

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,880
guys!

166
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,440
The Sects Alliance

167
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,460
will be set up today

168
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,400
no matter what it takes.

169
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Please

170
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
make your decision known

171
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,560
right now.

172
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,340
-Wait, but…
-What?

173
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
That’s not fair.

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,760
What should we do now?

175
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
Mr. Lin,

176
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
since I have nothing to do

177
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,040
with this matter,

178
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
I think I should leave.

179
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Wait. No.

180
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,960
Merciful Buddha.

181
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Goodbye.

182
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
But…

183
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,120
Bring the Imperial Guards here.

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,080
Kill Shangguan Tou

185
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,760
if he starts to attack.

186
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

187
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,940
Shangguan Tou.

188
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,760
Your debt of ruining
Fengzi’s engagement ceremony

189
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,720
is not paid yet.

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,960
And now you’re here to create another trouble?

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,880
You promised

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,060
not to set foot on the Sword Manor,

193
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,690
but then you’re here again.

194
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,080
Somebody come

195
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,220
and see this guest off!

196
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,760
Mr. Lin.

197
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,740
I didn’t expect you

198
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,120
to conspire with Lord Lu.

199
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,160
You are no longer the virtuous Mr. Lin

200
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,360
who cares about the martial arts world.

201
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,420
I have done everything

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,600
for the good of the martial arts world.

203
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,890
Who do you think you are to judge me?

204
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
Leave.

205
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,120
Go.

206
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,800
Wait!

207
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,760
Tou,

208
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,920
don’t you want to see

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,840
your sister for the last time?

210
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,880
What have you done to her?

211
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,420
This is the last thing she left

212
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
before she passed away.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Shangguan Tou,

214
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,880
you’ve been close to your sister.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,320
You must know

216
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,400
that she was pregnant.

217
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,520
You must do.

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,660
But you didn’t tell me.

219
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
You all lied to me.

220
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,680
Right?

221
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
How can you two be so cruel?

222
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
My poor baby!

223
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,120
My kid!

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,960
You!

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,000
You killed Zheng and her baby!

226
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
Shangguan Tou,

227
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,120
if you didn’t go against me,

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
she would not have been put in dilemma.

229
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,760
Now that Zheng is dead,

230
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,840
no one

231
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
will be able to protect you anymore.

232
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,000
You’ll die for

233
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,800
killing my wife and child.

234
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
Xue Lie,

235
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,920
you are a beast!

236
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,360
Stop!

237
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,080
Yuwen Muyuan,

238
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,620
you are Xuezhi’s Chief Guardian.

239
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,360
How can you

240
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,740
be reduced to Xue Lie’s henchman?

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,600
How can you do this to Xuezhi?

242
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Don’t bother talking

243
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,240
much to a henchman.

244
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,400
What?

245
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,810
What are you…

246
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,130
How dare you!

247
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,800
Shangguan Tou, you rebel.

248
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,880
Your evil attempt to assassinate Lord Lu

249
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,480
has led you to death penalty.

250
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,460
Your Highness,

251
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,570
he’s just being emotional.

252
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,620
He didn’t want to hurt you.

253
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,680
You don’t need the Imperial Guards to come.

254
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,180
Would you please be so kind

255
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,570
to forgive his offense?

256
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Offense?

257
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,840
You think his attempt to behead me

258
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,120
is nothing but offense?

259
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,280
Xue Lie,

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,280
you are being pathetic

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,560
as a prince!

262
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,540
My sister’s love for you has been in vain.

263
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,720
What a

264
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,200
rascal you are!

265
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
Shangguan Tou attempts to kill the prince.

266
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,340
His sin is beyond redemption.

267
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,640
Kill him.

268
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,440
Wait.

269
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,020
Your Highness.

270
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Today is my daughter’s wedding day.

271
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,760
Please don’t kill anyone here at the Manor.

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,860
Shangguan Tou.

273
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,720
Stop it.

274
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,660
Shangguan Tou.

275
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,240
I’m warning you.

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,360
Don’t do anything.

277
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,640
May way for me.

278
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,400
Make way.

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
Kill him!

280
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,320
Listen up,

281
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,490
whoever kills Shangguan Tou for me

282
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
will be rewarded.

283
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,200
Uncle,

284
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,380
I hope this is the last time
you help an outsider.

285
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,040
I want to see us

286
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
helping each other next time.

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,920
Master.

288
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
What happened?

289
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,640
Look at my good disciple.

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,080
It’s true then.

291
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,000
Master.

292
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,640
How dare you call me that!

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,940
I don’t want you to be my disciple,

294
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,480
or my son-in-law.

295
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,920
Because of you,

296
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,600
the Sword Manor

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,880
has become a puppet!

298
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,690
How shameless of you to call me your master

299
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
It’s all my fault.

300
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,240
Sorry!

301
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,600
I apologize.

302
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
Apologize?

303
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,069
Can apologies

304
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,160
undo what you’ve done?

305
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,960
You killed Tie Xiao,

306
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,520
and Hong Sheng.

307
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,770
You secretly practiced the Nine Moves

308
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,720
and used it to kill.

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,040
If people know about this,

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,520
how would I face other sects?

311
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,200
How would others think of

312
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,310
the Sword Manor?

313
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,120
Sorry, Master.

314
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,450
I’ve done wrong.

315
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,920
It’s my consequence to bear.

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,480
And I will

317
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,040
pay my debt with my life.

318
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,400
Stop!

319
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Fengzi?

320
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,080
Father,

321
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
he’s

322
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,360
wrong.

323
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,660
But even his death won’t be able
to make up for anything.

324
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
And we just got married.

325
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,520
Do you want me

326
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
to be a widow?

327
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,520
Father.

328
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,840
Given the current situation,

329
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
it will pointless

330
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,960
however harshly you reproach him.

331
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,840
We should think about a solution.

332
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,200
You leave first.

333
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,640
I need to think.

334
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Fengzi.

335
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,800
Fengzi.

336
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,720
Fengzi!

337
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,560
Fengzi.

338
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,090
Fengzi, don’t be angry.

339
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,560
Fengzi.

340
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,300
-Fengzi.
-Leave me alone!

341
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,560
You secretly practiced the Nine Moves

342
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,520
and got caught by Lord Lu.

343
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,840
So my father was threatened to work for him.

344
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,560
There is nothing you can say in your defense

345
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,820
But I’ve done all these

346
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,920
for you.

347
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,840
For me?

348
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
I’ve loved you ever since I was a kid.

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,530
But you didn’t care about me at all.

350
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,440
You didn’t care what I did or said.

351
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,440
Then Shangguan Tou came into the picture.

352
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,280
He’s the only son of the Imperial Advisor

353
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,640
and used to be your master’s beloved disciple.

354
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,600
He’s better than me

355
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,360
at martial arts,

356
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,920
appearance,

357
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,960
background, everything.

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,620
I’m nobody compared with him.

359
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,200
But

360
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
I am the one that loves you most.

361
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,840
How can you only see him?

362
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,160
I thought that

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,080
after he was expelled from Sword Manor,

364
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I’d got my chance.

365
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
If I keep showing my feelings to you,

366
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,320
you’d see my heart

367
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,560
and love me some day.

368
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,420
Then I saw how you looked at him

369
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,280
During the Hero Assembly.

370
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,880
I knew at that moment,

371
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,000
that you’d never forget him.

372
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,920
I couldn’t accept it.

373
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,520
I can’t accept this.

374
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
I am the one who has been by your side

375
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,920
all these years.

376
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,760
But all you care about is him!

377
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,440
So

378
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,970
I wanted to defeat him during the competition

379
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,760
to prove that I’m better
at martial arts than he is.

380
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,640
I wanted to prove that I am the only man

381
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,370
in the world that deserves you.

382
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,320
Then I won.

383
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
But you still felt nothing about me.

384
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,040
At that moment,

385
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,090
I accidentally met Hong Sheng,

386
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,360
who was dying.

387
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,560
I knew he could teach me the Nine Moves,

388
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,520
I thought

389
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
it’s a gift

390
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,520
to me from God.

391
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,520
I’d never give up the chance.

392
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,000
And he also offered to help me

393
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
because he could see my determination.

394
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
That was why I saved him.

395
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,320
I knew

396
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,920
I’d rule the world

397
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,280
after I mastered the Nine Moves.

398
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,820
I want to prove that

399
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,520
my ability is no less

400
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,080
or even better

401
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,760
than Shangguan Tou.

402
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,080
I wanted you

403
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,860
to forget about him

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,320
and take me in.

405
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,520
Qingmei,

406
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,720
that’s not what I care about at all.

407
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,800
I know.

408
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,360
Fengzi,

409
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,200
believe me.

410
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,720
I learned the Nine Moves
only to improve my martial arts,

411
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,840
not to kill.

412
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,320
Tie Xiao’s death

413
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,250
was an accident.

414
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,360
I did so to save you.

415
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,760
I asked him for antidote.

416
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,200
But he rejected and even humiliated me.

417
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,240
I…I had no choice but to kill him.

418
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
As for Hong Sheng,

419
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,340
he didn’t allow me to get married.

420
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,720
He didn’t want us together.

421
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,650
He wanted to ruined the Nine Moves.

422
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,960
I didn’t kill him on purpose.

423
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,120
So Fengzi,

424
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
believe me.

425
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,720
Qingmei,

426
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
why are you so silly?

427
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,400
For you,

428
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
I don’t care if I’m silly.

429
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,760
Fengzi,

430
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,920
Fengzi,

431
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,410
will you forgive me?

432
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,080
I don’t care if Master scolds me.

433
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,400
I don’t care what others think of me.

434
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,200
I don’t give a damn about others.

435
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
I only care about you.

436
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,620
And you are the only one

437
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,640
I have now.

438
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,760
Your Highness,

439
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,880
Master Shangguan is followed
not only by people from the sects,

440
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,540
but also the Imperial Guards.

441
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,640
What are the Imperial Guards doing here?

442
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,240
It is said that Lord Lu required them

443
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,160
to protect him from potential harm.

444
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
Master Shangguan was impulsive at that time

445
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,930
and tried to attack Lord Lu.

446
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,160
Lord Lu was too foresighted.

447
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,730
He didn’t know Shangguan Tou would show up

448
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,560
but predicted

449
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
that someone’d come and hurt him.

450
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,170
He announced to the public that

451
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,840
Shangguan Tou should be executed

452
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,320
for assassination of the prince.

453
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Master Shangguan

454
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,240
is put into grave danger now.

455
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
I have helped him get out of the city,

456
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,040
but

457
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,360
things have gone so far

458
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,320
that the ordinal plan would not work

459
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
anymore.

460
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Master Shangguan

461
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,700
seems to face an impending disaster.

462
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Act accordingly.

463
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,570
Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,400
Wait.

465
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,860
Make the announcement

466
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,280
that

467
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,800
the royal family will be hunting today

468
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,040
and all Imperial Guards should

469
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,960
escort us.

470
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,930
Ask them not to engage in

471
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
things that are beyond their duty.

472
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,290
Yes, Your Highness.

473
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,220
[Sword Manor]

474
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,680
Miss Chong.

475
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,560
What happened?

476
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,600
Master Shangguan attempted to
assassinate Lord Lu and thus was hunted.

477
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Then he ran away.

478
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,160
Where did he go?

479
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Out of town maybe.

480
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,160
Let’s use

481
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,140
the cuckoo’s chirp as our signal.

482
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,480
If anything happens,

483
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,440
follow the chirp.

484
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,540
It’ll lead you to somewhere safe.

485
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,880
Master!

486
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,400
Wuming?

487
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,330
Why are you here?

488
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
Ms. Qiu told me in her message

489
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,170
that you had headed for Dongdu.

490
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,880
Mr. Lin asked me to be here first.

491
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,810
I’ve been following you secretly.

492
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,560
I found the chirp weird just now

493
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,600
and it turned out to be
the Crown Prince’s signal.

494
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,130
His Highness sent you here?

495
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,680
His attendant wanted me to tell you,

496
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
“When a bird flying up high

497
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,680
gets caught,

498
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,980
death will be its only way to escape.”

499
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,680
His Highness

500
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,900
wants me to die in front of Xue Lie.

501
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,280
Master,

502
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,840
Lord Lu’s men are approaching!

503
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,440
Leave!

504
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,100
Miss Chong.

505
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Wuming, why are you here?

506
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Where’s Tou?

507
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,920
Things have gone out of control now.

508
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,120
It’ll be even more complicated if you show up.

509
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,840
My master

510
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,320
is blessed by God.

511
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,680
You don’t need to follow him.

512
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,400
Impossible.

513
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,520
I need to find him.

514
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,400
He’s in danger.

515
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,880
Miss Chong, Miss Chong!

516
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
Shangguan Tou,

517
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,880
you are a dead man.

518
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Save it if you want to escape.

519
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,120
I’ll leave your corpse intact

520
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,100
given my love for your sister.

521
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,060
I’ll do you a favor and help you

522
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,520
rejoin your father.

523
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,680
Xue Lie,

524
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
even if I die today,

525
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,360
I’ll be waiting for you in hell.

526
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,600
Do send my love

527
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,440
to Imperial Advisor for me.

528
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,440
Xue Lie,

529
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,600
you will reap

530
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,080
what you have sown!

531
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,280
You should have watched your mouth

532
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,480
as a dying man.

533
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,760
This is

534
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,080
my farewell to you.

535
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,960
Kill him!

536
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,000
Wait!

537
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,780
Would Your Highness give me the honor

538
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,700
of killing Shangguan Tou myself?

539
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,140
Chief Guardian Yuwen,

540
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,720
I know

541
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,200
you’ve always wanted to kill him

542
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,160
because he stole the one you love from you.

543
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,760
Very well.

544
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,920
I will

545
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
allow what you asked for.

546
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

547
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,200
You can leave.

548
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,160
Yuwen Muyuan,

549
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,420
do you know why the Hall of Flames was closed?

550
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,800
I do.

551
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,760
Then why are you helping your foe?

552
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,200
This is how I will win back that which I have lost

553
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
You’ll lose more

554
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
by doing so.

555
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,880
You are an artistic man, Master Shangguan.

556
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,160
In the company of chirp,

557
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,480
you are on the way to death.

558
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
How do you feel now?

559
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
The cuckoos chirp

560
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,920
for me exclusively.

561
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,840
I feel honored

562
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,920
even if I  die for it.

563
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,480
If you are given a second chance,

564
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,770
will this still be your choice?

565
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,200
If you are given a second chance,

566
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,250
Chief Guardian,

567
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,290
will this still be your choice?

568
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,440
Finally.

569
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,080
Tou!

570
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,400
Tou!

571
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,640
Why did you kill him?

572
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
He deserved it.

573
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Yuwen Muyuan,

574
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,960
I used to treat you as my brother.

575
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
But from now on,

576
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,280
you are my enemy!

577
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:54,920
Good.

578
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,720
Shangguan Tou is dead.

579
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,050
He fell off the cliff

580
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,540
and his body will not be found.

581
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
He will not know

582
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,560
even if you kill me.

583
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,520
Why?

584
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,720
I’ll kill you!

585
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,620
Protect His Highness!

586
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
You are a shameless beast!

587
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,000
I’ll teach you a lesson

588
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,090
on behalf of Yupan and Chong Ye!

589
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
From now on,

590
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,480
you are no longer the disciple
of the Hall of Flames!

591
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,280
If you dare approach Xuezhi again,

592
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,480
I’ll kill you!

593
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,080
I apologize for not carrying out my task well.

594
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,740
I am at Your Highness’s mercy.

595
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,130
It’s not your fault.

596
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,200
You are no match for Lin Changran.

597
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,260
Don’t be hard on yourself.

598
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,770
Chief Guardian,

599
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,120
from now on,

600
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,820
I’ll be entrusting you

601
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,480
with important errands.

602
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

603
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
But please do send your people

604
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
to look for Shangguan’s body down the cliff

605
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,640
just in case.

606
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,610
Of course I will.

607
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
I need to

608
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,920
see his body with my own eyes.

609
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,480
Your Highness,

610
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,440
we have found

611
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,040
Shangguan Tou’s corpse.

612
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
Let me have a look.

613
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,940
Your Highness,

614
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,040
it’d better if you don’t look at it.

615
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,920
His corpse

616
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,480
has almost been eaten up by beasts.

617
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,360
Your Highness,

618
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,120
are you OK?

619
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,760
I’m fine.

620
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,920
Your Highness, you’d better not look at it.

621
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,960
The corpse has

622
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,360
almost been destroyed now.

623
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,760
It’s of no use to check it.

624
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,600
And we all saw it

625
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
when Yuwen Muyuan stabbed

626
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,720
Shangguan at his heart.

627
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,560
Besides,

628
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,730
he fell off a steep cliff like this.

629
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,639
Whoever falls without wings

630
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,080
will stand no chance

631
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
to live under these circumstances.

632
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,120
Do you believe that’s Shangguan Tou?

633
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,480
I don’t feel reassured.

634
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,670
If Your Highness can’t rest assured,

635
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,400
I’ll send my people to keep watch
on Chong Xuezhi.

636
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,320
Then send your people

637
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,920
to keep a close watch on her.

638
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,760
Changran.

639
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,160
What’s your plan now?

640
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,680
I want to bring Xuezhi back to the Moon Valley

641
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,880
when she wakes up.

642
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I don’t want Lord Lu to know you took us in

643
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,480
and thus give you a hard time.

644
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,410
Don’t worry.

645
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,120
I have blocked the passage of message.

646
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,440
No one, even my daughter,
knows that you’re here.

647
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,700
Just stay here at ease.

648
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,240
Besides,

649
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,480
Lord Lu will never leave the Sword Manor alone

650
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
even if you’re not here.

651
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,620
Muyuan and Feng Mo are his men now.

652
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,720
He also called in the leaders of all sects

653
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,360
to discuss the establishment of the Sects Alliance.

654
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
A storm is brewing

655
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,140
in the martial arts world.

656
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
With nasty Feng Mo’s

657
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,160
incitement,

658
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,840
many smaller sects are said to be making moves.

659
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,100
The martial arts world

660
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,480
will be soon turned upside down.

661
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,480
You still want to fight against Lord Lu?

662
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,620
I know I’m no match for him,

663
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,560
but

664
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
even if I hold on for one more second,

665
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,680
we still have chance

666
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
when the Sects Alliance is not founded.

667
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,580
The martial arts world is now disunited.

668
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,000
If no one comes to unite us,

669
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,560
I’m afraid

670
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,840
you won’t change anything

671
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,090
with your own force.

672
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Speaking of uniting the disunited,

673
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,360
I know someone

674
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,090
who will do well in this job.

675
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,380
[Lord Xin’s Mansion]

676
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,000
How’s Master Shangguan doing?

677
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
The physician says he’s severely injured
but not in danger.

678
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,520
He’s not dead but it was close.

679
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,760
Whose body it is

680
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,800
down the cliff?

681
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
That’s an imperial musician who died of disease.

682
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
He has no social connections

683
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,160
or history.

684
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,400
What will Lord Lu find

685
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,020
if he tries to check up on this man?

686
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,600
He may not get anything

687
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,380
from a dead imperial servant.

688
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,840
Good.

689
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,040
What’s his name?

690
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,240
Yu Chunzhi.

691
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,280
Yu Chunzhi?

692
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,700
Your Highness,

693
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,080
there has been

694
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
a question on my mind.

695
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,000
May I

696
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,500
ask for your explanation?

697
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,440
Of course, Chief Feng.

698
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,760
Why do you want Yuwen Muyuan to be your man?

699
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
What’s your concern?

700
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,330
I’m worrying about Your Highness.

701
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,760
Falling from the Chief Guardian
of the Hall of Flames

702
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,090
to a homeless underdog,

703
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,490
he must have a lot going on his mind.

704
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,040
Your Highness recruited him at this point,

705
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,570
and if he has hidden agenda,

706
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,260
you will be in danger, Your Highness.

707
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,520
I have already

708
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,320
thought about this.

709
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
But things have changed.

710
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,720
Yuwen Muyuan now

711
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,240
is nothing like

712
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,600
when he was with the Hall of Flames.

713
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,420
Chief Feng, you didn’t see it,

714
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,650
but Yuwen Muyuan

715
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,840
killed Shangguan Tou

716
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,760
in front of Chong Xuezhi.

717
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,240
I admire his

718
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,160
determination and cruelty.

719
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,690
But don’t you worry.

720
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,840
I know clearly who’s more important.

721
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,300
Your Highness is sage.

722
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
But this man

723
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,360
is my bitter foe.

724
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,120
I know he killed your father,

725
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,360
but the world is changing.

726
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,080
You were on different sides before,

727
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:43,600
but now,

728
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
we are all working for the union

729
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,660
of the martial arts world.

730
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,480
I’m expecting you

731
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,160
to discard the hatred

732
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
and get prepared to fry the bigger fish.

733
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I see.

734
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,820
I beg your forgiveness

735
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,960
of my abruptness.

736
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,360
Tou! Tou!

737
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,820
Xuezhi, you’re awake.

738
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,360
Xuezhi.

739
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Uncle.

740
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,360
I dreamt that

741
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,960
Tou fell off the cliff.

742
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,640
Where is Tou now?

743
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,920
Uncle,

744
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,800
where is he now?

745
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
He…

746
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Don’t worry about him.

747
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,020
Your priority now is to recover from the injury.

748
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,200
No.

749
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,240
I’ll go find him.

750
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,560
-I’ll go find him.
-Xuezhi.

751
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,120
Xuezhi.

752
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,200
Where are you going, Xuezhi?

753
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,680
Xuezhi.

754
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,040
Xuezhi.

755
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,480
You…

756
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,880
Changran,

757
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,140
where is Xuezhi going?

758
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,890
Goodbye, I’ll see you some day.

759
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,880
Xuezhi!

760
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,440
Foxy Lin Zongxing!

761
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,160
He refused to work with me

762
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,680
and even worked against me.

763
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,200
How dare he save Chong Xuezhi

764
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,160
and meet Lin Changran!

765
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,560
Doesn’t he know that

766
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,920
two high-rank subjects should avoid each other?

767
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,440
I should have killed

768
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,140
this rebellious traitor!

769
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,640
Please calm your anger, Your Highness.

770
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,920
If Lin Zongxing can’t see the bigger picture,

771
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,320
Your Highness won’t need to
care about your kinship with him.

772
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,520
Moreover, Chong Xuezhi

773
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,320
seems to be dying.

774
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,320
She won’t change anything

775
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,120
even if Shangguan Tou is still alive.

776
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,480
Just when I got rid of Shangguan Tou,

777
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,840
Lin Zongxing came up.

778
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,080
Why is it so hard

779
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,800
to clear the way?

780
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,680
But you’ve got the point.

781
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
My uncle is too old

782
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,280
to shoulder vital responsibilities

783
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,880
even if I try to do honor to him.

784
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,640
The future

785
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,160
should be at the hands of the young.

786
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,800
You mean…

787
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,360
Xia Qingmei.

788
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
If he can

789
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,850
kill the monk who taught him martial arts,

790
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,200
then

791
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,200
he’ll be able to

792
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,680
kill Lin Zongxing who brought him up.

793
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,360
But

794
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,520
Lin is not only his master,

795
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,400
but also his father-in-law.

796
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,280
How would a sober man

797
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,010
commit such a monstrous crime?

798
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,840
On one hand, the Nine Moves

799
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,840
can help people make great achievements.

800
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,170
On the other hand, it can also ruin people.

801
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,250
There’s nothing

802
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,080
a demonized man won’t do.

803
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,200
With the monk dead,

804
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,080
Xia Qingmei is likely to turn demonized

805
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,160
if he studies the Nine Moves himself.

806
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,610
Your Highness is

807
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,920
indeed foresighted.

808
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,000
Mister,

809
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,480
Xia Qingmei is an intelligent man.

810
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,680
Please go and help him

811
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,160
so that he can go mad sooner.

812
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,400
I'll do it right away.

813
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,080
Off you go.

814
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,120
Tou.

815
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Tou.

816
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Where are you, Tou?

817
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
Tou.

818
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,280
Tou, where are you?

819
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,040
Tou,

820
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,960
where on earth are you?
