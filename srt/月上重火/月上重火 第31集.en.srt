[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 31

4
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,669
But sorry, grandpa.

5
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,600
I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you.

6
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,720
I’m not good enough

7
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,160
to live up to your expectations

8
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,600
But, grandpa,

9
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,600
I really couldn’t do that.

10
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,270
Sorry.

11
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,850
Every time I saw disappointment in your eyes,

12
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,720
I felt like dying inside.

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
Sorry, grandpa.

14
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
The Hall of Flames is now closed

15
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,650
and I’m the one to blame.

16
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,880
I’ve failed to keep our ancestors’ achievements.

17
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,630
Now

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
I can only bury you

19
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,670
in a hurry

20
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,890
at this remote place on mountain.

21
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,110
But I promise

22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,470
I’ll coffin you father

23
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,030
properly one day.

24
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,690
Your Highness.

25
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,270
You’ve done all the talking?

26
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,950
Everything’s ready.

27
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
Only one last step to go.

28
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,730
This is important.

29
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,390
Please, Your Highness,

30
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,960
make your decision soon.

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,600
One step forward

32
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,420
and we’ll have no way back.

33
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,480
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,520
This trap

35
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,670
is too complex for them

36
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,720
to solve.

37
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,079
And Your Highness

38
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,000
will be the only key to the puzzle.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,930
Let’s see if they

40
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,470
want this key.

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,800
Good.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,650
Ask the Imperial Guards

43
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,520
to stand by

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
and get ready.

45
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,110
Yes.

46
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,340
[Sword Manor]

47
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,360
Master,

48
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,230
Master.

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,370
The Hall of Flames has been closed.

50
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,070
What happened?

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,040
I heard that

52
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
Chong Xuezhi and Muyuan

53
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,440
had failed to deliver the weapons in time.

54
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
Now they’ll be disposed by the military

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,110
and the Hall of Flames

56
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,350
is thus closed.

57
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,790
Where are they now?

58
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,159
The last time people saw them

59
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,720
was when they were taken to the execution ground.

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,830
Other disciples have been dismissed.

61
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,510
Now

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,130
no one knows where they are.

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,159
Master,

64
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,200
how can

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,850
the Hall of Flames end up like this?

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,920
They have been targeted by all sects for years,

67
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,440
yet managed to survive.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,650
But now they are closed overnight.

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,220
There must be something behind this.

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,970
Is it because Chong Xuezhi

71
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,230
mastered the Nine Moves

72
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,150
and the government started to fear her?

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,760
We don’t know the reason yet.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,270
For years, we’ve been the only ally

75
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,790
of the Hall of Flames.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,390
Though we kept a low profile for some time

77
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,830
to avoid suspicion,

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,510
it’ll be improper for a respectable sect like us

79
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,600
to be an onlooker

80
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,870
when the Hall is facing such a fatal challenge.

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,160
Qingmei,

82
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,760
tell people

83
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,230
that the Sword Manor

84
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,880
is open to homeless disciples of the Hall.

85
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,450
If the Hall is closed for good,

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,760
other sects

87
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
will lose an equal match as a target.

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,880
Then we

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,020
will be in trouble too.

90
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,950
Yes.

91
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,720
Also,

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,670
there must be something behind

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,880
the shutdown of the Hall.

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,640
Go and

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,409
gather information around

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,490
to see if we can get something.

97
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,520
Remember,

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,010
keep a low profile.

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
Don’t let anyone notice you.

100
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,390
Yes, Master.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,390
Please come in.

102
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,510
This is the place.

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,160
Look.

104
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,510
There are little trees around the yard.

105
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,110
It’ll be cool here in summer.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
And this

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is the kitchen.

108
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,160
Spacious enough.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,920
This house

110
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,260
used to belong to my younger brother.

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
It’s been out of use for some time,

112
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,790
so it’s a bit messy here.

113
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,990
Small as the place is,

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,350
I think it’s perfect

115
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,320
for the two of you

116
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,710
to stay temporarily.

117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,830
What do you think?

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,480
Much better than I expected.

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,110
Good.

120
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,880
If you like it,

121
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,880
then I’ll buy

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
this house.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,510
This…is too much.

124
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,270
No.

125
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,480
Please use

126
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,950
the excess

127
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,390
to buy us some daily supplies

128
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,510
from the fairs around.

129
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Ok.

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
I’m going now.

131
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,550
Xuezhi,

132
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,200
sorry for

133
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,550
letting you stay at a place like this.

134
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,320
Have a rest.

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,580
I’ll go check the yard.

136
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,670
Mister.

137
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,130
Chief Guardian,

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
how can I help you?

139
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,880
You know me?

140
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,720
The Hall of Flames is famous around here.

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
How can I not know you?

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,010
Who are you exactly?

143
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,480
Easy, Chief Guardian.

144
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,230
Don’t worry.

145
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,880
I’m just a local farmer.

146
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,480
I worked part-time in Peace County

147
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,540
during the slack seasons of farming.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,880
I once

149
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,720
delivered weapons to the Hall.

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,640
That was

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,110
when I met you and Leader.

152
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,510
And that’s how I know you.

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,670
Is this really

154
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,460
your brother’s house?

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
It was my brother’s house indeed.

156
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,230
But his family

157
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
died of the flu years ago

158
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,870
when it went rampant.

159
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,720
I almost died too

160
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,670
when

161
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,070
the Hall of Flames

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,110
came to rescue.

163
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,230
Now you’re in trouble

164
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,510
and I’m paying you back.

165
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I don’t really feel right

166
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,480
to take your money for this.

167
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,640
It’s really kind of you to say so.

168
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,760
The Hall could never sit by

169
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,110
when the flu was killing so many people.

170
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,990
We’ve done nothing serious.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,230
Nothing serious?

172
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,270
Without

173
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,200
the Hall

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,460
and Master Shangguan,

175
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,350
I should be a ghost now.

176
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,110
You said you often

177
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,110
go to Peace County?

178
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
Did you hear anything

179
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,390
about the Hall of Flames

180
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,950
in the past few days?

181
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,340
After the Hall was closed,

182
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,400
the heroes from the Hall

183
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,799
were all dismissed.

184
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,590
I’ve heard nothing since then.

185
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,760
But I’ve been

186
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
keeping my eyes on this.

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
I’ll tell you

188
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
when I get something.

189
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,200
Thank you.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,960
Lord Lu,

191
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,570
Master Shangguan is here.

192
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,960
Bring him in.

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

194
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,670
Your Highness.

195
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Tou,

196
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,370
Have you made progress

197
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,960
in go game lately?

198
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,710
Your Highness,

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,930
why don’t you just get to the point?

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
Shangguan Tou,

201
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,930
you should go with the flow,

202
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,640
not against it.

203
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,790
I’ve told you before.

204
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,470
You don’t want your pawns

205
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,390
to be cleared out completely

206
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
from the chess board, do you?

207
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,190
If Your Highness can let your obsession go,

208
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,670
I’ll quit the game at once.

209
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,360
That’s impossible.

210
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,080
I’ll get to

211
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,030
my destination.

212
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
Aren’t you worried that

213
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,550
I may reveal your agenda

214
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,320
to the whole world?

215
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,640
I would have been

216
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,590
if the Hall of Flames still existed

217
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
But now that

218
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,840
the Hall is gone,

219
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,790
there’s nothing I should fear.

220
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,960
I’ll make it clear.

221
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,320
Getting rid of the Hall of Flames

222
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,650
was one step to remove the obstacles.

223
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,960
Look at the world now.

224
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,110
We don’t need the world of martial arts.

225
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,740
Your Highness have spent much more than needed.

226
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,440
You could have sent your army

227
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,550
to kill all martial people.

228
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,720
That would be much simpler, right?

229
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,110
You’re right.

230
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Just now I reported to His Majesty

231
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,470
that the Hall of Flames

232
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,880
had hidden imperial weapons

233
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,280
and worked with other sects for rebellion.

234
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,760
I’d help His Majesty

235
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,520
to repress the rebel forces.

236
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,150
You’re making up stories out of thin air.

237
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,910
The Imperial Advisor should know

238
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,880
more about making up stories

239
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
and covering things up.

240
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,530
Your Highness,

241
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,330
what has the Hall of Flames done wrong?

242
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,200
There are all trades of life in the world,

243
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,910
and they choose to practice martial arts.

244
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,470
That’s what they’ve done wrong.

245
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,130
People practice martial arts

246
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,550
only to help the government

247
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,350
to bring the evil to justice.

248
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,880
Why do you hate them so much?

249
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,790
That’s not their business to care about.

250
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,440
That’s

251
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
the government’s responsibility.

252
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,930
Let’s go back to Xiangzhou.

253
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,400
I, Shangguan Tou,

254
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,760
swear to the clear sky

255
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,290
that I will protect Xuezhi,

256
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,950
no matter how many difficulties

257
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,230
are lying ahead.

258
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,840
Whether she’s a leader or a fugitive.

259
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,800
Whether she’s with a righteous or an evil sect.

260
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,880
Whether

261
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,720
I can spend the rest of my life with her.

262
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,100
I’ll keep her safe anyway.

263
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,790
Please,

264
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,820
let me protect her.

265
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,590
Muyuan,

266
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,710
why are you staring at me?

267
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
Do I look

268
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
weird?

269
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,710
Of course not.

270
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,280
This is the first time

271
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
you’ve cooked for me.

272
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,030
I just feel happy.

273
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,520
Muyuan,

274
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,550
we’re living

275
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,710
a normal life as the ordinary people.

276
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,030
Look at you.

277
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Chopping the firewood and boiling the water.

278
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,220
But that’s different.

279
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,030
Back at the Hall,

280
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,110
we didn’t lead an extravagant life,

281
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,670
but we had good food, nice clothes,

282
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,280
and basically everything we needed.

283
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,230
But now

284
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,400
you are reduced to staying here

285
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
in a desolate mountainous place with me,

286
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,710
having the simplest food.

287
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,590
I feel sorry.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,760
Don’t be.

289
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,960
I like where I am now.

290
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,590
At least it’s much quieter here

291
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,640
than before.

292
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,440
Now

293
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,400
I don’t need to handle affairs of the Hall.

294
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,520
I won’t be annoyed

295
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,760
by the noises from weapon forging.

296
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,470
It’s a care-free life.

297
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,230
See?

298
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,640
It’s just been several days

299
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,670
and I’ve almost forgotten

300
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,760
the past.

301
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,550
But thinking about past,

302
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,880
I used to be

303
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
pathetically naïve.

304
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,470
How grandiloquent I was

305
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
to say things like

306
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,920
“I’m gonna see what the world has got.”

307
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,080
But now

308
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,790
the bygones have been bygone.

309
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,350
Muyuan,

310
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,640
do you remember

311
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,910
what I said?

312
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,280
I said,

313
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,110
if I was not the Leader of the Hall,

314
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,080
I would rather

315
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,350
be an ordinary girl.

316
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,350
Look at me.

317
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,400
I’ve

318
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,000
become an ordinary girl now,

319
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,730
saying ordinary stuff,

320
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,210
doing ordinary things,

321
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,370
and having an ordinary dream.

322
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,110
I remember how you always

323
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,550
complained about having no freedom

324
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,810
to do whatever you want

325
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,670
back at the Hall.

326
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,030
And now,

327
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,320
we are both free.

328
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,640
Let’s go hunting

329
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,230
after the lunch.

330
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,510
Good idea.

331
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Are you saying

332
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,960
Lord Lu has started

333
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,350
to suppress all sects now?

334
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,150
That’s right.

335
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,170
If His Majesty approves his request,

336
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,670
the martial world will have a catastrophe.

337
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,230
What a tough move

338
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,520
Lord Lu has made!

339
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,910
Isn’t he afraid the sects may rise against them?

340
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,790
Father,

341
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,110
do we need to

342
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,910
tell all sects to get ready?

343
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,000
Tell them?

344
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,470
Tell what?

345
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,810
Tell them to run away or rebel?

346
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,440
That

347
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,520
would not help

348
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,550
Tou,

349
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
I need to write to His Majesty.

350
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,150
There you go.

351
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,150
Smells good.

352
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,320
Today

353
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,470
is the Dragon Boat Festival.

354
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,280
Let’s

355
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,550
celebrate this.

356
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,400
Well,

357
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,710
in the simplest way.

358
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,440
All we’ve got are wild vegetables and cheap wine.

359
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,550
You deserve better though.

360
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,880
I like wild vegetables.

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,640
Wild food with fragrant wine,

362
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,700
going well with the beautiful night.

363
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,280
That’s true.

364
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,200
I’ve been pondering

365
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,330
in the past few days.

366
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,210
I want to try my best

367
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,850
to gather our disciples

368
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,320
and rebuild the Hall of Flames

369
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,640
in the near future

370
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,910
when things get better.

371
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,110
I need to give you back

372
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,000
what your father has left to you.

373
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Muyuan,

374
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,960
what my father has left to me

375
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,320
is not confined in the buildings at the Hall.

376
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
It is

377
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,030
in my heart,

378
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,710
in your heart,

379
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,910
and in the hearts of Chequ

380
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,030
and Zhusha.

381
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,950
It is in the hearts

382
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,750
of all the disciples of the Hall.

383
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
We will never be defeated.

384
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
What I want now

385
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,109
is that

386
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,400
no one will get hurt because of me.

387
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,800
And I have

388
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,329
nothing further to ask for.

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,560
Seriously

390
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,780
you want nothing more?

391
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,000
I know you.

392
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,290
You are saying this

393
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
to comfort me.

394
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,110
In fact,

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
you’re still very much haunted by the past,

396
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,290
and everything about the Hall.

397
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,430
Am I right?

398
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,770
I even promised to rebuild

399
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,350
the Hall of Flames for you

400
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,560
within 3 years.

401
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,190
Now that promise

402
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,810
sounds ridiculously impossible.

403
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,040
Muyuan,

404
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,190
you have done

405
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,310
enough for me.

406
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,800
Let’s just

407
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,280
enjoy the hermit life here

408
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,430
and forget about the past.

409
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,710
OK.

410
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,190
Then,

411
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,020
let the bygones be bygone.

412
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Happy Dragon Boat Festival.

413
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,040
What’s this flower?

414
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,110
It’s hollyhock.

415
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,220
They bloom around the Dragon Boat Festival.

416
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,440
Legend has it that there was a man

417
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,000
who was obsessed with all kinds of flowers.

418
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Once,

419
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,040
when he was sleeping at the garden,

420
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,350
in a trance,

421
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,680
a lady in black

422
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
led him to the fairyland,

423
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,560
where all gods were singing and dancing.

424
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,040
But then a wind came

425
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,680
and woke him up.

426
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,160
He realized

427
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,240
there was nothing around him

428
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,430
but a hollyhock

429
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,310
swaying in the wind.

430
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,760
He then stumbled onto the fact that

431
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,400
all those beautiful scenes

432
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,460
were nothing but an illusion.

433
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,570
This is an ominous flower.

434
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,560
Throw it away.

435
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,310
Why should I?

436
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,110
That’s just a legend.

437
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,280
Besides,

438
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,470
maybe when the man woke up

439
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,280
he’d be reminded of the beautiful things

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
whenever

441
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
he saw the hollyhock.

442
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,040
But illusions

443
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,640
is bubbles to be broken.

444
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,910
The more you enjoy the illusion,

445
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,230
the more disappointed you’ll be

446
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,230
when you wake up, right?

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,430
Muyuan,

448
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,760
what’s wrong with you today?

449
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,000
You’re being sentimental.

450
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
Let’s have dinner.

451
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,040
Eat.

452
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,400
Here.

453
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,160
Xuezhi,

454
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,350
just like the man

455
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,110
led to the fairyland,

456
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,280
every second here with you

457
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,310
is too beautiful to be true.

458
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,330
I don’t want the wind to come

459
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,760
and blow everything away.

460
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,930
Even if this is an illusion,

461
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,000
I want it

462
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,470
to last forever.

463
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Time brings enormous changes to the world.

464
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,640
All I ask for

465
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,760
is but an ordinary moment

466
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,040
and you.

467
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,310
If you like it,

468
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,650
I’ll give you

469
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,520
a flower every day.

470
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,400
Tou,

471
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,400
if you still feel the same way,

472
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,170
then don’t let the hollyhock wither.

473
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
But if you don’t,

474
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,550
then just let the wind

475
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,280
blow it away.

476
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,190
Xuezhi.

477
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,070
Muyuan, I’m here.

478
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,560
What are you doing

479
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,090
at this time in the morning?

480
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,040
I’m looking for the hollyhock

481
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,680
I brought back yesterday.

482
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
But I just

483
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
can’t find it anyway.

484
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,130
Even if you find it,

485
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,350
it won’t be as it was

486
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,710
after a whole night of wind and rain.

487
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,110
We just can’t keep beautiful things,

488
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,070
can we?

489
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,700
It’s not like that.

490
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,920
It’s just…

491
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,190
we tend to miss them.

492
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,270
Everything will be gone, right?

493
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,350
I won’t.

494
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Bracelet!

495
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
Did you make it?

496
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,710
Of course.

497
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,040
I asked the land lady

498
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,950
for some cords last night.

499
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,280
But I was not a dab hand at this.

500
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,410
It took me the whole night to finish it.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,060
Let me put it on you.

502
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,070
I’ve never got a bracelet like this

503
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,040
ever since I grew up.

504
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,590
You know what?

505
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,950
From now on, I’ll give you a bracelet

506
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,480
every Dragon Boat Festival

507
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,820
and make you moon cakes

508
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
every Mid-Autumn Festival.

509
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Long story short,

510
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,070
I’ll be with you

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,650
for every festival.

512
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,070
Thank you, Muyuan.

513
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,190
Don't thank me,

514
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,520
You’ve said this phrase enough

515
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,050
that I won’t forget it ever.

516
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,910
I don’t want your gratitude.

517
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,430
I just want you

518
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,110
to see me.

519
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,250
I’m going hunting.

520
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,950
Don’t

521
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,880
go with me today.

522
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,350
You won’t be able to kill any animals.

523
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,000
We’ll be eating wild vegetables tonight

524
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,350
if you come.

525
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,800
Then you go hunting,

526
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,920
and I’ll cook some nice dishes for you.

527
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,470
OK.

528
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,710
good

529
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,310
The Nine Moves deserves its reputation!

530
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,830
You just mastered the sixth move

531
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,400
and you can defeat enemies way outnumbering you.

532
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,110
How invincible you’ll be

533
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,870
when you reach the ninth!

534
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,430
So the legend is true

535
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,960
that a master of Nine Moves can rule the world.

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,710
Qingmei,

537
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,160
come here.

538
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,230
From tomorrow on,

539
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,770
I’ll be teaching you the seventh move.

540
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
But

541
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,830
you must know

542
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,520
that the seventh, eighth,

543
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,640
and ninth moves

544
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,310
are the toughest ones

545
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,070
among the Nine Moves.

546
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,880
Mr. Hong,

547
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,310
why is that?

548
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,070
The three moves

549
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,610
are basically the same.

550
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,290
If so, does that mean

551
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,670
I can master the three moves in one shot?

552
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,240
That’s not the case.

553
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,560
This is where the complexity lies.

554
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,040
One same move,

555
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,630
three different states.

556
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,280
If you don’t perceive them,

557
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,080
you won’t be able to master them.

558
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,280
That means

559
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,190
if I want to master the three moves,

560
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,110
I have to improve my comprehension.

561
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,710
Exactly.

562
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,350
Maybe

563
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,230
the tricks are written in the Lotus Sutra.

564
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,560
But don’t worry.

565
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,000
If you work hard,

566
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,760
with my guidance,

567
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,640
you’ll learn the last three moves anyway.

568
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,880
But

569
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,070
if I master the Nine Moves,

570
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,230
I will inevitably try to use them in fight.

571
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,230
That will cause me

572
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,920
a lot of troubles.

573
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,260
Nine Moves is the most powerful in the world.

574
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,770
Who will dare to rise against you then?

575
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,480
The Hall of Flames was shut down,

576
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,960
and Chong Xuezhi almost lost her life.

577
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,920
These terrible things happened

578
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,640
all because people feared the Nine Moves.

579
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,000
I’m worried that

580
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,920
if I keep practicing the Nine Moves, I will…

581
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,580
What’s that supposed to mean?

582
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,410
You’re afraid now?

583
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,110
You were the one who begged me

584
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,640
to teach you the Nine Moves.

585
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,310
Don’t you want to learn

586
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,170
the best martial art in the world?

587
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,370
Chong Xuezhi is no less competent than me.

588
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,840
But the Hall of Flames

589
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,490
was closed overnight.

590
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,720
You’re wrong.

591
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,520
The shutdown of the Hall of Flames

592
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,800
has nothing to do with the powerful art.

593
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,760
It’s all because the Nine Moves

594
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,020
was not under the government’s control.

595
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,190
Looking back

596
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,680
into the history,

597
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,110
most martial experts

598
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,290
worked for the powerful and wealthy.

599
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,700
But think about it,

600
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,310
if not so,

601
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,130
how many chances do they stand

602
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,560
to establish their reputation?

603
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,590
Chong Xuezhi

604
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,390
will be a perfect warning to you.

605
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,350
warning?

606
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,520
What do you mean?

607
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,560
You know the answer.

608
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,430
You mean,

609
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,620
I should work for the government?

610
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,250
Impossible.

611
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,280
This will be

612
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,680
betrayal to my sect.

613
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,710
Betrayal?

614
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
Xia Qingmei,

615
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,110
I’ve long seen you through.

616
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,680
You are a man

617
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,800
coming from a poor family.

618
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,470
You don’t want others to look down on you,

619
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,000
so you pushed yourself hard

620
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,160
and finally won the Hero Assembly.

621
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,880
What you want

622
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
is the approval by Lin Zongxing.

623
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,560
But

624
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,430
you are not satisfied by

625
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,830
by the Seven Techniques of Universe.

626
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,880
You want more powerful art

627
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,470
because you want to rule the martial world.

628
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,520
What do you mean?

629
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,520
It is good

630
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,430
to have aspirations.

631
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,650
With your ability,

632
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,310
you’ll start as a general at least

633
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,240
if you join the government’s army.

634
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,560
But if you stay here at the Sword Manor,

635
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,190
you’ll be a humble disciple your whole life,

636
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,350
treated casually

637
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,400
by Miss Lin.

638
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
That’s the life you want to live?

639
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,950
Xia Qingmei,

640
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,040
a wise man

641
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,890
needs to seize the opportunity

642
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000
in adversity.

643
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,400
Please come here tomorrow.

644
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,880
I’ll find some work for you to do.

645
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,710
Let’s call it

646
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,560
a day now.

647
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,710
Please go home.

648
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,710
Go home.

649
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
See you tomorrow.

650
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,110
See you tomorrow.

651
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,840
Mr. Manager.

652
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,980
Mr. Manager, please wait.

653
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,010
Mr. Manager.

654
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,230
You must be

655
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,520
Guardian Chequ and Guardian Zhusha.

656
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,040
How are you doing?

657
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,470
We’ve come to see

658
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,450
if there’s any work we can do here.

659
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,310
Well…that won’t be an easy job for me.

660
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Even if

661
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,400
we have vacancies,

662
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,440
I’m afraid we can’t turn to you.

663
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,110
What?

664
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,590
What do you mean?

665
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,400
The Hall of Flames has been closed.

666
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,350
No one

667
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,810
dares to hire you anymore.

668
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,710
Sir, Ma’am,

669
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,860
I have a family to support.

670
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,760
So please

671
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,280
don’t give me a hard time.

672
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,680
Did you see that?

673
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,710
We’ve done

674
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,190
so much for them in the past.

675
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,160
Now we are in trouble

676
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,560
and nobody comes to help?

677
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,640
People!

678
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,280
Zhusha.

679
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,490
Complaint is of no use.

680
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,170
We should find a solution.

681
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,280
Solution?

682
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,810
Where can I find a solution?

683
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,760
Dummy.

684
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,310
Hey,

685
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,060
if we had worked harder

686
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,560
for the Hall,

687
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,430
maybe the Hall

688
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,810
would not have been closed, right?

689
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,950
Sorry.

690
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,910
I should have worked harder.

691
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,280
That’s not what I mean.

692
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,280
Chequ?

693
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,160
Zhusha?

694
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,590
Mr. Xia?

695
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,800
Guardians.

696
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,280
Why are you here, Mr. Xia?

697
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,800
I heard that

698
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,950
the disciples of the Hall

699
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,150
have been dismissed.

700
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,430
So my master asked me

701
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,030
to inquire about the reason.

702
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
The reason is…

703
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,230
Why does Mr. Lin

704
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,560
want to know about this?

705
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,090
He thought there must be a reason behind.

706
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,090
He sent me here to figure it out

707
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,240
so that we can help the Hall out of this.

708
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,110
I see.

709
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,090
There is a reason behind

710
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,710
the shutdown of the Hall.

711
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,950
But we haven’t

712
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,800
found it out yet.

713
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,950
What’s your plan

714
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,210
for future then?

715
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,310
We don’t know.

716

This is a message from my master.

730
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,440
He asked me to gather

731
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,430
the dismissed disciples of the Hall

732
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,710

734

738
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,230
Indeed.

739

and eradicate the evil.

876
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,830
We can’t afford another case

877
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,120
like that of the Hall of Flames.

878
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,430
Lord Lu

879
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,730
is prudent enough.

880
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,520
He will make another plan

881
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,910
even if

882
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,230
he fails this time.

883
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,230
Father,

884
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,660
what do you think his plan will be?

885
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,230
Mr. Advisor,

886
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,230
several martial men are waiting outside

887
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,120
to see you.

888
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,390
What for?

889
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,520
They want to thank you for

890
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,910
upholding justice for the martial world.

891
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,710
They have got some gifts for you.

892
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,080
What?

893
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,760
Mr. Advisor,

894
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,470
I am with the Sword Manor.

895
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,710
I’ve come with the disciples of other sects

896
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,170
to express our gratitude.

897
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,400
It’s kind of you.

898
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,870
May I ask

899
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,000
how Mr. Lin’s wound on the shoulder is?

900
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Mr. Lin’s wound on the shoulder is  much better.

901
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,710
Mr. Advisor, you came to rescue

902
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,840
when the government was about

903
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,120
to find fault with all sects.

904
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,190
You are our savior.

905
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,040
Our leaders sent us here

906
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
to present you with some gifts.

907
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,560
Hope you will like them.

908
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,190
Thank you for your kindness.

909
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,040
But I can’t

910
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,630
accept the gifts.

911
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,360
These are just some herbs

912
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,470
that carry our gratitude.

913
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,430
Nothing valuable.

914
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,440
Please keep them, Mr. Advisor.

915
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,430
Sir,

916
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,360
we’ve still got work to do.

917
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,420
Will you excuse us?

918
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,840
Stop.

919
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
My father has never spoken to anyone

920
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,290
about his words to His Majesty.

921
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,650
How did you know about that?

922
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,580
[Ganoderma]

923
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,390
What’s this?

924
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,470
Tell me.

925
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Who sent you here?

926
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,040
Did you bring

927
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,500
the Imperial Guards here?

928
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,670
Sir!

929
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,390
Sir! Bad news.

930
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,560
Imperial Guards came with an imperial warrant.

931
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Imperial Guards?

932
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,800
Father,

933
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
we’ve been set up.

934
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,280
Lord Lu didn’t just make a report.

935
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,280
What he really wanted is to set us up.

936
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,040
These are martyrs working for Lord Lu.

937
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
Now they’re dead,

938
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,710
but the blades are still here.

939
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,390
We won’t be able to escape from

940
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,720
the trap Lord Lu has set.

941
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,240
He’s really made up his mind

942
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,000
to kill me.

943
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,040
You can’t stay here.

944
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,670
Tou,

945
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,760
you must leave at once.

946
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,600
But, father…

947
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,000
Go hold the Imperial Guards back!

948
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,630
Yes.

949
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,150
Father,

950
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,670
I can’t leave.

951
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,190
The Imperial Guards will break in soon.

952
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,760
I need to stay to prove your innocence.

953
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,390
Lord Lu has set us up.

954
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,670
If you stay,

955
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,230
then

956
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,320
he’ll get what he wants.

957
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:51,600
Father,

958
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,840
let’s go together.

959
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,630
No way.

960
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,610
I am the Imperial Advisor.

961
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,800
If I leave at a time like this,

962
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,260
I’ll become a traitor.

963
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
And the Shangguan family will never

964
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,560
be able to undo the injustice.

965
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,470
Tou,

966
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,600
you have to leave

967
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,120
and stop Lord Lu.

968
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,910
But, father.

969
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,670
-I…
-Wuming.

970
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,330
Take him out of here right now!

971
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:13,710
Father.

972
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,560
Master.

973
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,190
I don’t want to leave you alone…

974
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,040
Leave.

975
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,180
Father.

976
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,760
Just leave.

977
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,840
Father.

978
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Take care.
