And The Winner Is Love

3
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,820
Episode 2

4
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,390
Young Master, are you alright?

5
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm fine.

6
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,030
Young Master.

7
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,870
Thanks for saving me.

8
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,270
I’m Xia Qingmei of Sword Manor.

9
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,670
So is this the manual of...

10
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,470
Young Master,

11
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,670
please behave yourself.

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,800
This belongs to our sect.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,400
It’s my father’s manual.

14
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,600
I’ll take back that thanks.

15
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,110
Sword Manor and Hall of Flames are close.

16
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,190
I’m here as requested by my master

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,960
to protect your sect.

18
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,870
The real world is dangerous.

19
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,240
You’d better be cautious.

20
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,690
Don’t make enemies easily.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,080
See you at the Assembly.

22
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,000
Young Master.

23
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,240
Muyuan.

24
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,800
Young Master, are you alright?

25
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm good.

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,600
Who was that person?

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,390
Xia Qingmei of Sword Manor.

28
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,440
He saved me

29
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,720
from Silver Whip School’s assassination.

30
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,630
Sword Manor.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,450
Chief Guardian,

32
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,950
those men of Silver Whip School are clingy.

33
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,960
You have no right to complain.

34
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,910
Do you know how many eyes are on Young Master

35
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,270
and the Lotus Sutra?

36
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,670
How dare you take her out?

37
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,440
Muyuan,

38
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,079
don't blame her.

39
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,000
Paintings! Paintings!

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,670
Have a look.

41
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,079
Hero Assembly will soon kick off.

42
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,910
All sects will be there.

43
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,190
Attendees include Leader of Moon Valley,

44
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,750
Shangguan Tou.

45
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,890
Sir, would you like to buy a painting?

46
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,440
Have a look.

47
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,740
[Secret Guard of Moon Valley Wuming]

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,800
They’re of the imperial style and high quality.

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,830
This is...

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,600
That notorious witch,

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,070
head of Hall of Flames, Chong Xuezhi.

52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Would you like to buy one?

53
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,360
Are you thinking about tomorrow’s assembly?

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
All talents will be there

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,880
to fight for fame and wealth.

56
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,830
But that doesn’t interest me at all.

57
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,830
I’m wondering when I can get to Emei,

58
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,670
but I've promised others

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,870
to protect that girl.

60
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,190
Hope there won’t be any trouble.

61
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,480
The sooner it's done, the sooner I can leave.

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,810
I’ve found them for you.

63
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,070
They’re staying at Tianbao Inn.

64
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,920
Sir,

65
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
guess

66
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,070
who is in the painting.

67
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,020
[Tianbao Inn]

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,000
Priest.

69
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,350
Abbess.

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,510
Our Huashan Sect has just arrived

71
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,200
and hasn’t had time to visit you.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
I apologize.

73
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,640
Have a seat.

74
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,110
Chief Feng, let’s skip the formalities.

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,270
You invited us over this late

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,570
for something important, didn’t you?

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
I’ll cut to the chase then.

78
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,200
May I ask

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,550
why you attend this Assembly?

80
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,950
Why?

81
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,670
Hero Assembly is a major event

82
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,100
held every two years.

83
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,500
[Chief of Shangqing Sect Priest Xingyi]

84
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,159
This year’s won’t be any different.

85
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,440
Huashan Sect isn’t new to the Assembly.

86
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,100
[Chief of Emei Sect Abbess Ciren]

87
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,350
Chief Feng, what’s your point of asking that?

88
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,600
You mistook me.

89
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,510
As you know,

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,510
Assemblies in the past

91
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,840
were to select the best martial artist.

92
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,350
But this year’s is different.

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
The winner will be able to negotiate

94
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,790
with Hall of Flames on behalf of all sects

95
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,900
[Emei]

96
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,110
to decide on the ownership

97
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,970
of Nine Moves and the Lotus Sutra.

98
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,250
Sparring only serves as a routine.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,330
The owner of Nine Moves and the Lotus Sutra

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,880
should be the sect supported by all.

101
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,790
Which one do you think it is, Chief Feng?

102
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,920
In terms of prestige,

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,159
Sword Manor is most authoritative.

104
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,720
But it’s partial to Hall of Flames.

105
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,390
Not everyone will be satisfied with its decision.

106
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,760
Isn’t it better for Huashan Sect

107
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,600
to handle the manuals?

108
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,760
Merciful Buddha.

109
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,510
Leader Yuan,

110
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,140
[Abbot of Luduan Temple Shiyan]

111
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,920
may I ask this gentleman’s name?

112
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,640
This is Chief Disciple of Sword Manor.

113
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,760
Xia Qingmei.

114
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,920
Merciful Buddha.

115
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,830
Please.

116
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,200
He’s Xia Qingmei of Sword Manor.

117
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,950
They say he’s a rising star

118
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,550
who’s mastered Mr. Lin’s skills at a young age.

119
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,920
He seems to be formidable.

120
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,070
Leader Yuan,

121
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,040
please.

122
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,920
This is Mr. Lin’s seat.

123
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:57,040
Since he isn’t here,

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,200
as Sword Manor’s representative,

125
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,240
Mr. Xia, please take that seat.

126
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,510
Sure.

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,230
I’ll take it.

128
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,880
Fengzi,

129
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,510
sit.

130
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,480
Sure.

131
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,040
Father.

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,600
Where’s head of Sword Manor, Lin Zongxing?

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,650
Only the one holding the potato

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,350
can tell if it's hot.

135
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,720
In the eyes of the public,

136
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,760
Lin Zongxing is upright and desireless.

137
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,440
By not showing up,

138
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,370
he’s sending a message to the world

139
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,789
that what everyone is dying to acquire

140
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,789
means nothing to him.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
That makes sense.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,789
Lin Changran and Lin Zongxing

143
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,520
are Emperor’s brothers

144
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,030
with noble ranks.

145
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,760
They can’t care less

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,590
about some manuals.

147
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,230
Not exactly.

148
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,960
Qingmei,

149
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,150
why is everyone staring at us?

150
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,590
Fengzi,

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
their eyes aren’t on us

152
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,760
but that manual.

153
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,400
Merciful Buddha.

154
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,910
May I ask

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,640
you’re Young Master of Hall of Flames?

156
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,290
Yes. I’m Chong Xuezhi.

157
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,790
Please.

158
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Relax. I’m here.

159
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,670
It's Shangguan Tou! Shangguan Tou!

160
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,590
Merciful Buddha.

161
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,030
May I ask you're...

162
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,550
Shangguan Tou of Moon Valley.

163
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,670
I wasn’t aware

164
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,640
that Moon Valley would also be present,

165
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,110
so no seats were reserved for you.

166
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,030
I’m making arrangements now.

167
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,080
That’s fine.

168
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,080
One chair is enough.

169
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,030
Please.

170
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,440
That’s right. He’s so handsome!

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
Fengzi,

172
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,590
sit back.

173
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,520
Isn’t he

174
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,640
an unworldly god?

175
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,150
He’s Shangguan Tou.

176
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,520
He isn’t any better than the painting.

177
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
Young Master.

178
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,520
Rumors about him

179
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,450
are mostly associated with girls.

180
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,080
Shangguan Tou is always unruly

181
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,880
and self-willed.

182
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,080
I bet

183
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,880
he’s only here for fun.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
For fun?

185
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,110
He came to make it more fun.

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,910
Everyone, welcome to Dongdu

187
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,080
for the biannual Hero Assembly.

188
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,150
It ends at sunset

189
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,880
with three drumbeats.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
The one who remains on stage will be the winner.

191
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,880
As per the longstanding rules,

192
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,550
the sparring shouldn't be life-threatening.

193
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,280
You may begin.

194
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,670
Good! Yes! Go on!

195
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,910
Anyone else?

196
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,110
Good! Well done!

197
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,760
Who else will challenge me?

198
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
Good one! Wonderful!

199
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,000
They're all from small sects.

200
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,150
When will the real game begin?

201
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,080
Master.

202
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,350
Is it our turn?

203
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,670
Not yet.

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
Emei’s skills

205
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,320
aren’t inferior to Huashan’s.

206
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,590
Chief Feng,

207
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,670
are you asking us to lose to you?

208
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,910
No need.

209
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,110
You can just

210
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,520
pick another sect.

211
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,550
Chief Feng,

212
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,840
why should Huashan Sect get the two manuals?

213
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,670
When Chong Ye lost control of himself,

214
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,320
he killed my father first.

215
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,520
We suffered a huge loss

216
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,050
to eliminate that monster.

217
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
So those manuals should be given

218
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,550
to our sect.

219
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,400
We deserve them.

220
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,440
If you two side with us

221
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,030
and help me win,

222
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I’ll share the manuals with you.

223
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,230
Hold on.

224
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,840
To be the winner,

225
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,740
one must be highly skilled

226
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,770
and seize the perfect timing.

227
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,870
The Assembly opens within a time limit.

228
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,910
By the time it ends,

229
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,880
and you're the only one on stage,

230
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,350
you win.

231
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,790
Father,

232
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,000
when is it my turn?

233
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,400
Bai Mulin,

234
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,150
you first.

235
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,200
Yes.

236
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,900
Bai Mulin of Huashan Sect.

237
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,350
Pleasure to meet you.

238
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,840
Please.

239
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,320
Good! Yes! Well done!

Yes! Wonderful! Great!

241
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,530
Those two manuals are priceless.

242
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,030
Since Lotus Wing reappeared,

243
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,080
everyone is craving for it.

244
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,150
Huashan Sect is generous.

245
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,150
We're willing

246
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,760
to share the manuals with others.

247
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,610
Once they're made public,

248
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,880
they won't be secret anymore.

249
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,520
That way, the battle will end.

250
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,960
What do you think?

251
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,590
I, Bai Mulin, heard that

252
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,150
members of Hall of Flames are highly skilled.

253
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,520
I’d like to challenge...

254
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,280
I’m up for it.

255
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,150
May I ask who you are?

256
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,230
Can you introduce yourself first?

257
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,880
That can wait

258
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,150
after I beat you.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,860
Isn’t he Man Feiyue’s man?

260
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,920
Divine Spirit Temple is known for poison.

261
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,220
Be careful, everyone.

262
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,550
Alright, sir.

263
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
I surrender. You won.

264
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,520
I lost.

265
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,040
Which sect are you in?

266
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,160
Can you tell us your name?

267
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,829
I already lost.

268
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,829
You want to know my name to insult me?

269
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,520
Don’t go.

270
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:20,829
I’ll go get him.

271
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,400
Don’t.

272
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,760

why did you stop me?

275

Don’t forget

276
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,430
why we're here.

349
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,690
Mr. Shangguan is amazing.

350
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,110
Mr. Shangguan.

351
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,830
Moon Valley

352
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,520
seldom attends the Assembly.

353
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,830
Why have you

354
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,710
become competitive all of a sudden?

355
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,280
Competitive?

356
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,230
I’m here because I want to

357
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,120
and I can also witness

358
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
how great Mr. Xia is.

359
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
Fine.

360
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,040
I’ll show you

361
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,160
how capable I am

362
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,830
and

363
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,430
to have a taste of skills of your sect.

364
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,830
Yes! Well done! Go!

365
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,760
Good! Good job!

366
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,230
Go on! Yes! Yes!

367
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,160
Good job!

368
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,680
Go, go, go!

369
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,880
Fantastic!

370
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,950
Nice move.

371
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,950
Yes! Excellent!

372
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,310
Mr. Shangguan.

373
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,710
Very well done.

374
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,530
Amazing.

375
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,310
Do it. Beat him.

376
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,640
Go on. Mr. Shangguan.

377
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,710
Mr. Shangguan, go!

378
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,110
Good job! Yes! Go on!

379
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,950
Amazing! Yes!

380
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,280
Sorry.

381
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,690
Why did he leave?

382
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,640
I know.

383
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,430
He left.

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,040
Why did he leave?

385
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,350
Time is up.

386
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,920
That’s an end of the Assembly.

387
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,350
Mr. Shangguan left

388
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,020
and quit the competition.

389
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,710
The Assembly concludes.

390
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,310
I hereby announce

391
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,680
that the winner of this year’s Hero Assembly

392
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,520
is Xia Qingmei of Sword Manor.

393
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,590
Yes! Good!

394
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,040
Great!

395
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,560
Fengzi,

396
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,690
Xia Qingmei is the winner.

397
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,860
Are you surprised?

398
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,310
Fengzi,

399
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,220
are you still thinking of him?

400
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,190
I...I...

401
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,230
Don’t forget who you are.

402
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,350
Yes, Master.

403
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,960
Thank you, everyone.

404
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,310
Tomorrow, I’ll wait for you

405
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,390
at Dongdu Hall in Luduan Temple.

406
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,280
We’ll be negotiating with Sword Manor tomorrow.

407
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,340
Hope Hall of Flames

408
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,160
can give us a satisfactory answer

409
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,430
regarding the five-year pact.

410
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,520
Yes! Yes!

411
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,050
Don’t worry, Young Master.

412
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,950
Negotiating with Sword Manor

413
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,430
isn’t too bad.

414
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:34,400
Good! Yes!

415
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,590
What’s wrong?

416
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,230
How come...

417
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,950
Mr. Xia.

418
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,710
Internal injury.

419
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,430
Mr. Xia!

420
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,880
Yes.

421
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,150
That’s right.

422
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,830
Mr. Xia.

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,930
Qingmei, can you hear me, Qingmei?

424
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,230
He seems

425
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,070
to have been poisoned a while ago.

426
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,920
He won’t make it till the end of the day.

427
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,230
Which heartless monster poisoned him?

428
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,830
Who was it

429
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,950
that poisoned Qingmei

430
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,190
in such an evil way?

431
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,590
I remember it.

432
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,800
He had tea during the Assembly.

433
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,950
Tea?

434
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,000
Was he

435
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,000
poisoned by the tea from Luduan Temple?

436
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,280
Here he is.

437
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,640
Did you serve tea to Mr. Xia?

438
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,350
I did bring it to him,

439
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
but...but...

440
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,040
But what?

441
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,190
That tea

442
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,310
was supposed to be given to Hall of Flames.

443
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,170
Hall of Flames?

444
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
Abbot Shiyan.

445
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,230
We’re here to check on Mr. Xia.

446
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,590
We were about to look for you.

447
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,590
Xuezhi,

448
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,590
Qingmei had the tea that should've been yours

449
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,800
and got poisoned.

450
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,350
Tea?

451
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,680
Liuli.

452
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,110
Yes.

453
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,400
Liuli is skilled in medicine.

454
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,310
Maybe she can remove his poison.

455
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
Mandala Poison.

456
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,830
Mandala Poison?

457
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,190
It’s from the west.

458
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,000
How did it get here?

459
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,400
What to do?

460
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,290
Liuli, can you make the antidote?

461
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,230
I can

462
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,430
but it takes time.

463
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,950
Some herbs are hard to find.

464
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,920
It might be too late

465
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,000
when the antidote is ready.

466
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,400
Everyone,

467
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,310
Mr. Xia’s poison

468
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,640
must have something to do with Man Feiyue.

469
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,880
On our way to the Assembly,

470
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,590
she ambushed us.

471
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,710
She must be the one

472
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,110
who poisoned Mr. Xia.

473
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,470
Yes.

474
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,800
Whether she did it or not,

475
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,640
she must have the antidote to save Mr. Xia.

476
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,470
Man Feiyue is evil.

477
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,830
She must’ve killed my disciple, too.

478
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,640
Divine Spirit Temple is our common enemy.

479
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,520
I’ll catch her

480
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,770
to avenge my disciple’s death

481
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,400
and get the antidote for Mr. Xia.

482
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,540
Thank you, Chief Feng.

483
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,570
Let’s go.

484
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,110
Fengzi,

485
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,740
take good care of Qingmei.

486
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,420
I’m going to get the antidote.

487
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,000
Mr. Xia needs to rest.

488
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,590
Let's go back.

489
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,880
Why isn’t Chong Xuezhi dead?

490
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,830
Don’t blame me.

491
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,680
You saw me drug the tea.

492
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,880
It was

493
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,430
Xia Qingmei’s fault.

494
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,760
I don’t care.

495
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,520
You must figure out a way

496
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,350
to kill Chong Xuezhi!

497
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,190
That won’t be easy.

498
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,000
I’m already exposed.

499
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,680
All sects are after me now.

500
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,310
Chief Wang,

501
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,950
I’m not good at keeping secrets.

502
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:19,760
I dare you!

503
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
That depends on

504
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,800
if you’ll keep your promise.

505
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,590
Chief Wang,

506
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,290
that’s only half of the agreed amount.

507
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,640
Stop there, witch!

508
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,730
Hand over the antidote.

509
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,840
Leader Yuan, you can stop.

510
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,670
I’ve had the antidote.

511
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Chief Wang of Silver Whip School?

512
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,840
I am.

513
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,949
When your nephew was poisoned,

514
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,389
that woman was there.

515
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
I assumed she must've done it,

516
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,280
so I tracked her here.

517
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,360
Bring back the antidote

518
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,239
to save your nephew’s life.

519
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,170
Thank you, Chief Wang.

520
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,190
Qingmei, you’re awake!

521
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,040
Fengzi.

522
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,280

I’m glad you're awake.

Qingmei, you’re still weak.

Don't say anything.

Keep Nine Moves of Lotus God safe.

527
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,160
Rest assured, Qingmei. I will.

528
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
Have some rest.

He's safe now.

Don’t worry too much.

534
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Thank you, Abbot.

Abbot.

536
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,430
Qingmei wants you

537
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,000
to keep Nine Moves of Lotus God for him.

539
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,000
Qingmei is asking us

540
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,760
to protect this manual.

541
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,760
I know.

542
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,120
Isn’t protecting him

543
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,470
our priority?

544
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,040
You forgot what your father said

545
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,280
before we left?

546
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
He said this manual

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,710
cannot be out of our sight.

548
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,610
So I’m entrusting it to someone trustworthy.

549
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,800
Do you mean I’m untrustworthy?

550
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,080
No, Master.

551
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Qingmei is severely injured.

552
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,000
You and I

553
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
aren’t able to keep the manual safe.

554

If it’s missing,

555
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,530
my father won’t forgive me.

Tomorrow, at the convention,

It reminds me of our childhood.

597

Back then, you weren’t guardians

Leave everything till tomorrow.

people who practice those Moves

673
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,840
will get hurt by them eventually

as if they were living in hell.

675
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,810
Practicing those moves alone

676
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,760
will only lead to death.

681

682
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,280

00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,080
How could we hand such treasures

698
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,390
to your sect?

699
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,080
I think

700
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Huashan Sect should keep them.

701
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,320
No wonder Chief Feng was quiet just now.

702
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,660
You were waiting for this moment.

703
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,870
Leaders,

704
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,890
since these manuals will only cause harm,

705
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,150
why don’t we burn them

706
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,840
once and for all?

707
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,560
No, no, no!
