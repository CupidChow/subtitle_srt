Elder. Please stay here.

19
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,110
I’m gonna fight until death.

20
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:00,840
-Go.
-Don't!

21
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,000
Death is no hard,

22
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,350
but the century-old foundation of Hall of Flames

23
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,270
will be ruined!

24
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,830
Elder. In this situation,

25
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,920
they are coming in very soon.

26
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
What to do, Elder?

27
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Are we gonna wait and die?

28
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,240
Except the Pavilion of Flames,

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,110
all other places

30
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,040
have been controlled by us.

31

Zhusha. Calm down.

32
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,440
But the result is the same if we wait.

33
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,110

36
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
I’m not afraid of death,

37
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,670
but we can’t die like this.

right in the backyard.

For so many years,

48
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,450
I’ve dreamed of destroying the Hall of Flames

49
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,390
to avenge my father’s death.

50

I made it.

52
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,880
I know you’re racked by anxiety at the moment,

53
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,670
yet

54
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,110
you can do nothing.

55
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,550

What are we waiting for here?

59

Let me go out and fight!

60
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,110
Wait a while longer.

61
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,200
We can’t wait.

62
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,150
The Hall is gonna be destroyed.

63
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,520
If we go out, we’ll fall into Feng Cheng’s trap

64
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
and die in vain.

65
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,789
We must try to delay.

66

You fight against my sect repeatedly.

This time

77
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,640
you attack my sect while I’m away,

78
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,900
and disrupt my father’s peace in heaven.

79
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,250
I’m telling you.

80
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,350
As long as I’m alive,

81
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,800
you will never have your way.

82

Attack!

83

Don’t push me.

84

Stop crying.

86
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,690
Why did you conceal it from me?

87
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,030
Why didn’t you tell me my mother was dead?

88
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,470
How long do you want to use me?

89
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,170
Since you’ve known it,

90
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,710
there’s no need to keep you alive.

91

99

any last words?

100
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,910
She hoped

101
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,850
you could forgive her.

102
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,880
Liuli was a spy from Emei.

103
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
She said everything.

104
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,590
I know

105
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,110
you can’t accept it right now.

106
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,470
No one

107
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,840
can accept it.

108
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,760
Liuli was a spy,

109
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,560
but she meant no harm to you.

110
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,550
Nor to the Hall of Flames.

111
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,670
She was...

112
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,470
She was just coerced by Emei

113
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,350
and had to do that.

114
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,640
Leader.

115

You’ve been sitting here for long.

Let me take you back to Zhaoxue Tower to rest.

117
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,320
Just leave me alone.

118
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,330
Wait for me here.

119
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,710
Xuezhi.

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,290
Master Shangguan.

121
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,960
What brings you here?

122
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,680
I want to take Liuli away.

123
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,590
Her mother,

124
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,230
Abbess Baiyun,

125
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
is my aunt.

126
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,080
Before she died,

127
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,880
she asked me to look for her biological daughter

128
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,280
and take good care of her.

129
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,790
It’s my bad.

130
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,590
I failed my aunt.

131
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,350
Since she parted

132
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,110
from her daughter,

133
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,750
they had never met again.

134
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,320
So,

135
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,570
I want to take away Liuli’s body

136
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,830
and bury her with her mother.

137
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,350
That way,

138
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,200
they can be reunited.

139
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,370
Why didn’t you tell me Liuli was your cousin?

140
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,440
Why did you conceal all the things from me?

141
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,080
I’m sorry

142
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,220
for the things before.

143
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,970
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

144
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,470
As for Liuli,

145
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,710
we just met when we were

146
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,440
at the Winehouse of Fairyland.

147
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I promised her

148
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,470
to keep it a secret.

149
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,570
Because it concerns the Hall of Flames and Emei.

150
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,440
She meant to tell you everything herself.

151
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,460
And I need your help

152
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
for another thing.

153
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,880
You want me to conceal her identity from others.

154
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,530
Actually, even if you don’t ask me to do it,

155
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,280
I would do so.

156
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,400
Liuli was indeed a spy from Emei,

157
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
but she had no choice.

158
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Moreover, over these years,

159
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,560
I could feel she was truly kind

160
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,800
to me.

161
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
Liuli is dead now.

162
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,430
I wish

163
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,000
she could rest in peace as well.

164
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,240
The Hall of Flames suffered the havoc.

165
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,520
It can’t stand anymore crisis.

166
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,000
Besides,

167
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,160
there’s another thing.

168
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,110
I caught Feng Mo.

169
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,350
He inadvertently told me

170
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,280
there could be

171
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:40,080
another huge power behind Feng Cheng.

172
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,040
I’m afraid his attack against the Hall of Flames

173
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,570
wasn’t simply for revenge.

174
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,830
I think

175
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,920
he’ll do more harm

176
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,470
to the Hall of Flames.

177
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,690
You should be more careful.

178
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,030
Feng Cheng was injured by me.

179
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,070
He won’t

180
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,650
come again in a short time.

181
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,230
Anyway,

182
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,570
thanks for reminding me, Master Shangguan.

183
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,230
I will

184
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,000
remember this.

185
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,040
Master Shangguan,

186
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,440
if there is nothing else,

187
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,510
please be on your way as quickly as possible

188
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,560
The Hall of Flames is to be restored.

189
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
I

190
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,430
have no energy

191
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,670
to think about other things.

192
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,880
Xuezhi.

193
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,020
[Lord Lu’s Mansion]

194
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,450
Your Highness.

195
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,320
The Hall of Flames was attacked.

196
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,210
How was the situation?

197
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,280
Leader Chong and Chief Guardian

198
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,880
arrived in time and repelled the siege,

199
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,040
however, the Workshop was ruined, disciples killed.

200
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,280
Elder Yuchi died.

201
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,740
The whole sect suffered a great loss.

202
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,830
The Workshop was ruined?

203
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,520
Yes.

204
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,070
When it rains,

205
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,950
it pours.

206
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,560
I wonder how long it can hold on.

207
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,640
Nature takes from the rich

208
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,310
and gives to the poor.

209
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,590
My reading doesn’t go well today.

210
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,350
I want to

211
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,620
consult you on something.

212
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,480
Yes, Your Highness.

213
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,400
The key of war

214
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,040
lies in the knowledge about the generals.

215
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,800
What does it mean?

216
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,950
Roughly speaking,

217
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
it just means

218
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,220
you should know both yourself and your enemies.

219
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,830
I still don't get it.

220
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,400
The casual talk may be an example.

221
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,230
The revival of the Hall of Flames

222
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,880
depends on whether Leader Chong

223
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,950
is the right person for the position.

224
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you think Leader Chong

225
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,470
is the right person?

226
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,280
We may wait and see.

227
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,160
I’ll go to Dongdu for father-in-law’s birthday.

228
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,470
You may go with me.

229
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,470
Yes.

230
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,810
Shangguan Tou.

231
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Did Huashan Sect suffer a lot in this attack

232
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,330
against the Hall of Flames?

233
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,800
So many people dead in the Hall.

234
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,820
Maybe Huashan and Emei

235
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,040
are no better than it.

236
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,400
Yeah.

237
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,430
It’s said Feng Cheng was also injured.

238
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,070
He’s injured? Is it serious?

239
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,140
What’s wrong with you?

240
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,610
How come you care about Huashan suddenly?

241
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,800
No... Nothing.

242
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm just asking.

243
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,000
Feng She.

244
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,590
You don't hem and haw

245
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,950
like this normally.

246
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,930
Are you keeping anything from me?

247
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
No... Nothing.

248
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,590
Well.

249
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,920
Let me ask you a question

250
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,230
If your father were a jerk

251
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,590
hated by all the people,

252
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
what would you do?

253
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,800
If he’s a good father,

254
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,070
even if people think he’s evil,

255
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,470
he’s still my father.

256
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,520
But if he keeps things from me

257
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,330
and is untrustworthy,

258
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,590
I won’t recognize him

259
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,520
no matter how much he is respected.

260
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,170
Shangguan Tou.

261
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,710
I told you before

262
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,170
I had my own secrets.

263
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,430
Now

264
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,120
I want to reveal my secrets.

265
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,000
So, I can’t go with you.

266
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,040
Thanks for your care all this time.

267
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,350
Take care.

268
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,590
Feng She.

269
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,350
Do you think

270
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,630
family is more important

271
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,430
or friends?

272
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,190
Back then,

273
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,690
I had neither family

274
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,000
nor friends.

275
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,230
Now

276
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,110
I have friends,

277
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,520
and also...

278
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,190
I don’t know how to answer it.

279
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,710
Go ahead.

280
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,350
Wuming.

281
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,520
Master.

282
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,760
Follow him

283
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,430
and check where he’s going.

284
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,000
Tell me if anything.

285
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,280
Don't expose yourself.

286
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,800
Yes.

287
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,040
Hadn’t I insisted on going to the Winehouse

288
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,960
to investigate the Huashan disciple’ death,

289
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,230
Emei and Huashan

290
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,590
wouldn’t have got the chance.

291
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,640
Elder Yuchi and Liuli wouldn't have died.

292
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,070
The Hall wouldn’t have been like this.

293
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,560
Leader.

294
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,060
That was Feng Cheng’s scheme.

295
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,130
Don’t blame yourself so much.

296
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,470
Leader.

297
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,460
Luckily, you came back in time

298
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
and thwarted their plan.

299
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,190
Their loss was no less than ours.

300
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,800
I could've stopped what happened.

301
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,640
How about

302
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,440
chasing and eliminating them once for all?

303
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,360
I don't think so.

304
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,170
After this battle,

305
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,430
the Hall of Flames is badly damaged.

306
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,560
If we chase them now,

307
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,830
more casualties will be caused.

308
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,230
Well.

309
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,680
Do we have to swallow it?

310
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,680
The priority now

311
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,470
is to settle the injured disciples.

312
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,160
Chief Guardian.

313
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,760
I’m afraid

314
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,190
we have more urgent things

315
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,920
to deal with.

316
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,230
Two days ago,

317
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,040
the Hedong governor made a military order

318
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,990
and asked us to make 1,500 blades

319
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,760
within 70 days.

320
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
70 days?

321
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,640
1500 blades?

322
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,920
This task is impossible.

323
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,920
The governor

324
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,460
used to need 500 blades a year at most.

325
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,880
How come he needs so many this year?

326
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,710
It isn’t

327
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,470
mentioned on this.

328
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,950
It just says

329
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,170
if we can’t do it in the allotted time,

330
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,600
we’ll be punished as per military laws.

331
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Chequ.

332
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,070
Given our production speed,

333
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,400
how long will it take

334
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
to forge 1,500 blades?

335
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,680
Normally,

336
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,990
it’ll take four months at least.

337
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,680
But...

338
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,640
What?

339
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,310
Huashan Sect destroyed our workshop,

340
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,190
and hurt most disciples and craftsmen.

341
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,120
Our sect is heavily understaffed.

342
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,520
The Workshop was destroyed,

343
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,430
and we got a huge military order.

344
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,040
Combining two things,

345
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,920
I’m afraid someone is deliberately

346
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,200
making it hard on us.

347
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
It isn’t that easy

348
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,400
to get through this.

349
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,560
Listen.

350
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,560
Give my order

351
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,590
to all the disciples in the Hall of Flames.

352
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,520
Try to restore the Workshop first.

353
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,860
Then forge weapons day and night.

354
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
The blades must be made

355
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,680
even around the clock.

356
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,880
Yes.

357
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,470
Zhusha.

358
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,460
Go to Peace County.

359
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,040
Hire as many people and artisans as you can

360
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,280
to help us.

361
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,920
Yes.

362
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,680
The Hall of Flames

363
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,950
has survived

364
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,950
no matter how difficult it is.

365
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,590
Although

366
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,350
the situation is grim this time,

367
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,880
as long as we work together,

368
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,590
we can surely get it done.

369
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
[Sword Manor]

370
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,110
Go out of the sect right now.

371
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,070
Check it out

372
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,970
and report to me immediately.

373
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,560
Yes.

374
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,740
-My lady.
-My lady.

375
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,800
Father.

376
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,680
Fengzi!

377
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,790
You are finally back.

378
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,040
It’s all my bad.

379
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,350
I got you worried.

380
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
I’m glad you’re back.

381
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,920
You...

382
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,350
Right.

383
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,590
Qingmei

384
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,640
has been worried about you.

385
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,910
Where is your master?

386
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:15,920
Father.

387
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I’d like to

388
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,680
tell you something.

389
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,950
Xuezhi.

390
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,400
Muyuan.

391
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,110
I’ve been thinking about something.

392
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,430
I think I should tell you.

393
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,160
What is it?

394
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,430
In the Winehouse of Fairyland back then,

395
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,230
Lord Lu sent his envoy to me.

396
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,400
Lord Lu?

397
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,950
What for?

398
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,350
From what the envoy said,

399
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,330
they wanted to woo our sect.

400
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,950
Woo our sect?

401
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,160
Why?

402
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
The world is huge

403
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,190
and complicated,

404
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,680
with things entangled.

405
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,610
Superficially,

406
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,430
Lord Lu said

407
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,910
we could use his power

408
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,640
to restore the prestige of our sect.

409
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,590
Actually,

410
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,490
I think he wants our sect to unify the world

411
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,640
and be used by him.

412
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,350
I just turned down him,

413
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,800
and then

414
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,500
Huashan Sect and Emei Sect

415
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,350
came to attack us.

416
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,760
The Workshop was just destroyed.

417
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,350
The order of 1,500 blades

418
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,110
came to us.

419
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,520
I don’t think

420
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,430
it is a coincidence.

421
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,350
I think it has something to do with Lord Lu.

422
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,590
One thing after another.

423
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,280
I’m led by the nose

424
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,540
and can’t do anything.

425
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,370
Don’t be so dispirited.

426
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,280
A big tree attracts

427
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,620
the woodman's axe.

428
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,590
Our sect is regarded

429
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,070
as a threat

430
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,110
by all other sects.

431
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,280
So,

432
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,990
either being used by him,

433
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,760
or

434
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
being eliminated by him.

435
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,570
Think about it.

436
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,650
If your father were alive,

437
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,970
what would he do?

438
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,680
My father?

439
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,310
He would never give in.

440
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,520
That’s it.

441
00:27:59,230 --> 00:27:59,950
So,

442
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,200
we can’t give in easily, either.

443
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,360
The priority now

444
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,310
is producing the blades as soon as possible.

445
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,310
For other things,

446
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,430
just wait and see.

447
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
Rest assured.

448
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
I will be with you.

449

[Blade Aura Beyond the Sky]

450
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,330
Fate really makes fool of people.

451
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,110
I never thought

452
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,800
Yuan Shuangshuang and Feng Cheng

453
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,950
would have such an affair.

454
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,800
Father.

455
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,680
What do you think about this?

456
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,920
In my lifetime,

457
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,760
I’ve seen all kinds of things

458
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,070
and tricks in the world.

459
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,470
Otherwise, how can I guard

460
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,520
such a vast legacy of Sword Manor?

461
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,640
Actually,

462
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,910
I’m worried about you

463
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,590
the most.

464
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,000
You followed your master since childhood.

465
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,560
You must feel very sad

466
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,870
for what happened to her.

467
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,350
Father.

468
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,230
Since my master has left,

469
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,310
can you

470
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,590
let go of this matter?

471
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,720
Did I ever say to hold her accountable?

472
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,070
I know what you're thinking.

473
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,470
She lied to you,

474
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,050
but she was your master after all.

475
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,130
She came for Nine Moves of Lotus God originally.

476
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,200
Now the Nine Moves has been destroyed.

477
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,690
Her identity is revealed.

478
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,070
I don’t think

479
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,200
she will come back again.

480
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,310
Luckily, you're safe.

481
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,950
I really don’t want you

482
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,520
to get involved

483
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,310
in these grudges,

484
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
lest she is incited by villains

485
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,070
and does harm to you.

486
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,400
And I can let go of

487
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
all other issues.

488
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,400
Got it, father.

How come you’re so badly injured?

492
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
It’s not serious.

493
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,230
Chong Xuezhi’s skills

494
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,400
are much improved.

495
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,150
Her Lotus Wing

496
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,160
is way more powerful than I imagined.

497
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,160
It’s my fault.

498
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,880
If I

499
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,280
had stolen Nine Moves of Lotus God earlier,

500
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,930
you wouldn’t be in trouble.

501
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,440
It's not your fault.

502
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,070
Sword Manor is heavily guarded.

503
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
Otherwise,

504
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,350
other sects wouldn’t have agreed

505
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,520
to store the Nine Moves in Sword Manor.

506
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,400
How was your trip?

507
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,510
Shangguan Tou and others

508
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,520
found out who I am.

509
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Did you get hurt?

510
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,040
A minor injury.

511
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,560
I’ve had the medicine for internal injuries.

512
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,680
Cheng,

513
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,850
you must take good care of yourself

514
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,210
and get recovered soon.

515
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,760
Since they know your identity,

516
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,560
you can’t go back to

With the current manpower and pace,

it’s hard for us to deliver on schedule.

523
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,000
Tell the disciples to work harder.

524
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,710

I’d like to ask you a question.

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,710
Have you ever thought about working for the court?

674
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,560
Father. You know

I have no interest in politics.

Why do you ask all of a sudden?

I know you don’t want to be in the court.

678
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,230
I do want you to stay away

it’ll be easier to do the work.

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,000
apparently.

700
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,080
The connections

701
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,600
are intertwined,

702
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,560
like deep water

703
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,850
where you can’t see the bottom.

704
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,260
As for the sects and the court,

705
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,120
which is on the surface? Which is at the bottom?

706
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,120
You're wrong.

707
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
The court

708
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,670
is the deep water,

709
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,140
while the sects

710
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,520
are the fish in it.

711
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,000
Fish in the water?

712
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,710
Thanks for your advice, father.

713
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,900
[Huashan Sect]

714
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,150
Sit.

715
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,880
It’s fine.

716
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,800
I’ll stand.

717
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,810
Why do you say I’m your father?

718
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,600
Man Feiyue told me.

719
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,520
Man Feiyue?

720
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,320
But she died shortly after that.

721
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,840
So,

722
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,080
no one can prove it.

723
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,150
If you don’t believe me...

724
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,870
Say no more.

725
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,870
I believe you.

726
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,560
Really?

727
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,870
You do look like your mother

728
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,670
when she was young.

729
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,870
My mother?

730
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,780
What did she look like?

731
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,320
Your mother was

732
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,910
a very kind woman.

733
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,360
I was young and ignorant.

734
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,290
I made the mistake and failed her.

735
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,330
I hope you don't blame me for that.

736
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,550
Actually, over these years,

737
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,320
I’ve been looking for you.

738
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,630
But I didn’t know where you were.

739
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,710
Feng She.

740
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,040
Would you recognize me?

741
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
She.

742
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,230
Come home.

743
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,080
Give me a chance to make up for it.

744
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
Are you admitting

745
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,190
that I am the second young master of Huashan?

746
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,230
Of course.

747
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I’ll stay then.

748
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,150
We may talk about the rest later.

749
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,470
Sure.

750
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
It's all up to you.

751
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,600
She.

752
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,670
Do you

753
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,210
have friends in the Hall of Flames?

754
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,150
Your grandfather...

755
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,010
I know you hate the Hall of Flames.

756
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,840
I wish you'd stop going after them.
