(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,892
An orientation for new hires
is planned in the afternoon.

8
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,667
Will you handle the training
like you did last time?

9
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:47,067
Who chose this year's new hires?

10
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:50,613
I told you the HR Team and I were
responsible for the recruiting.

11
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,569
Why? Is there someone who's bothering you?

12
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,268
No, it's nothing.

13
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,853
There's a girl named Gil O Sol
among our new recruits.

14
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,335
I don't know if you remember her.

15
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:12,034
She showed off some amazing talent
during this year's fitness test.

16
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,646
It turns out, she's the one
who found your robot vacuum...

17
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,268
...and returned it to you last time.

18
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,839
It's strange how your paths
have crossed like this.

19
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:23,279
Personally, I'm looking forward
to working with her the most.

20
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,734
Is that so?

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,912
I'm looking forward to it as well.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,012
-Right?
-You chose really carefully, right?

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,613
-Of course.
-Did you do a personality test?

24
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,734
Of course we did.

25
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,634
I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,945
Oh, gosh!

27
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:38,001
Please do something about this!

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,646
Move over!

29
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:41,602
O Sol, you have to make it stop.

30
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:44,834
Watch out!

31
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,479
O Sol, I'll help you!

32
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,168
Move! What do I do?

33
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,035
O Sol!

34
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:07,968
Are you okay?

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Mr. Jang.

36
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:30,299
Cleaning equipment...

37
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,348
Cleaning equipment should be handled
after becoming fully aware...

38
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,308
...of the instructions. Understood?

39
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:38,975
I'm sorry, sir.

40
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,107
I was told to practice using this...

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,133
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,367
Mr. Jang.

43
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,278
(2018 Orientation
for New Cleaning Fairies)

44
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,168
Good afternoon.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm CEO Jang Seon Gyeol,
and I'll be in charge of your training.

46
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,366
Before you begin your work,

47
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,001
I'll give a brief explanation
about our regulations...

48
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,367
...and the process of working
at this company.

49
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,677
Listen carefully...

50
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,001
...and please start your work...

51
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,767
...without making any mistakes.

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,634
First of all, I have a question.

53
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:43,100
For those of you gathered here,
what does cleaning mean to you?

54
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,134
Cleaning Fairy...

55
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,368
...has been found upon on this question.

56
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,330
I knew it.

57
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,400
Spicy chicken feet are the best.

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,010
Can we get one more serving?

59
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,412
Hey, tell me again.

60
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,513
So you're saying that
the 3,500-dollar-guy...

61
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,572
...was the CEO of Cleaning Fairy?

62
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,328
Your new workplace?

63
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,882
Yes.

64
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:15,345
Based on his looks and attitude,

65
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:16,967
I knew he wasn't someone poor.

66
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,000
But how could our paths
cross like this again?

67
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:24,767
Gosh, seriously.

68
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:28,101
Stop sucking off the sauce.
That's so gross.

69
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,702
This is really incredible.

70
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,492
How was your first day at work?
Isn't it an amazing company?

71
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,702
Gosh, your CEO looked really handsome too.

72
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:37,940
I envy you.

73
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,600
Handsome my foot.

74
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,971
Hey. He's mentally ill and totally
obsessed with cleanliness.

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,640
What? Mentally ill?

76
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,574
Hey. How could you be
so cruel to your CEO?

77
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,608
You're so mean.

78
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,097
I see. I was mean?

79
00:04:53,896 --> 00:04:55,200
Give me a break!

80
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:57,879
I've never seen anyone
like her in my whole life.

81
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,079
I have no idea
when she even washed her hair...

82
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:03,080
My hair? It's okay if I don't
wash it for a day or two.

83
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,114
Instead of me not washing
my hair for a day,

84
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,766
he's the weirdo. He washes his
hands dozens of times a day.

85
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:10,733
It seemed like he was performing
a ritual or something.

86
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,189
How could he soap up
his hands so thoroughly?

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,554
That's not all.

88
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,303
I think he's afraid of germs.

89
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:20,420
He always lays a handkerchief
before he sits.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,203
How could she sit anywhere
when it's overflowing with germs?

91
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,726
That's not all, you know.

92
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,443
Does she have a hole on
her chin or something?

93
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,658
Why does she spill everything
she eats or drinks?

94
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:33,077
And why on earth does she
rub it with her shoe?

95
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,879
I'm not even sure if her
shoes are clean either.

96
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,017
He totally stared at me like a beast...

97
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:39,279
...as if he never spilled
anything in his whole life!

98
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,434
Seriously, I can't understand
her from my point of view.

99
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,664
Yet, you still think I'm mean?

100
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:47,335
Hey. He's more than mean.

101
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,879
He thinks he's the only
clean person in this world.

102
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,712
He's such a weirdo.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,870
I've never seen anyone like him.

104
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:54,805
What?

105
00:05:54,894 --> 00:05:56,828
How much will he nag me from now on?

106
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,826
How on earth did I end up
working in his company?

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,611
What? What are you looking at?

108
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,679
You little...

109
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:07,814
-Mr. Jang.
-Wait.

110
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:09,414
-Mr. Jang.
-Just fire me then.

111
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,515
Come over here.

112
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,416
-What did you say?
-Do you want to die?

113
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,584
Is that a weapon? You're holding a weapon.

114
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,040
-Do you want to die?
-This is attempted murder.

115
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,763
I'm going to call the police.

116
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,498
Do you want to get beaten
up by a chicken foot?

117
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,121
-Calm down.
-Come over here.

118
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,244
Sit down. Stop causing a fuss.

119
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,728
Seriously...

120
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,458
-What are you looking at?
-Stop staring at me.

121
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:28,979
You're too short and I can't even see you.

122
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,568
Don't you dare look at me.

123
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:37,849
I need to calm down.

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,734
(Gil O Sol)

125
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,834
Yes!

126
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,345
The word has already spread that far?

127
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,381
My daughter, O Sol, managed to land a job.

128
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,700
Oh, did I tell you?

129
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,161
Don't you worry.
I'll definitely treat you.

130
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,617
I'll take you out for dinner twice.

131
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,961
All right, talk to you soon.

132
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,072
My goodness.

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,306
I mean, you getting a job
isn't that big of a deal.

134
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,461
Why are people calling about
it so early in the morning?

135
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,128
Eat up.

136
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,495
O Sol, what kind of company is it again?

137
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,754
What? It's just a normal company.

138
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,477
Oh, right. Yeong Sik said
that he got a job too.

139
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,949
What was the company called?
Was it Cleaning Fairy?

140
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,317
He said that it's a cleaning company.

141
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,718
-A cleaning company?
-Yes.

142
00:07:30,806 --> 00:07:33,317
He's young. Why did he get
a job at a company like that?

143
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,885
His parents must be worried.

144
00:07:34,974 --> 00:07:38,291
Gosh, what's wrong with working
for a cleaning company?

145
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,882
You're in the same field.
Don't say things like that.

146
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,929
I'm only saying it because I've done it.

147
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:44,726
In summer, you must put up
with the scorching heat.

148
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,574
And in winter, you freeze your butt off.

149
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:49,384
You have to tussle with garbage every day,
and it's not easy at all.

150
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:52,880
But I heard that company pays well,
and many young people work there.

151
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,703
Shall I pick up a part-time job there too?

152
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,138
You dimwit, stop spewing
nonsense, will you?

153
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,039
Even if it's a small company,

154
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:03,526
you need to get an office job
like O Sol did to take it easy.

155
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:04,849
You're clueless.

156
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:08,054
I absolutely cannot see my kids
working at a place like that.

157
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,960
Yes, this is only temporary.
Just for the time being.

158
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:19,305
I got this.

159
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:32,839
That day, you left your
phone number and took off.

160
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,277
Who knew we'd meet again here?

161
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,527
This...

162
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,253
...must be fate.

163
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,738
Fate, my foot.

164
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,939
You're both a lot more
experienced than we are.

165
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:46,705
We have a lot to learn,

166
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,289
so please help us out.

167
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,039
-Hey, are you deaf or what?
-Hey.

168
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:54,973
Behave yourself.

169
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:56,904
Say hello.

170
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,338
Please help us out.

171
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:05,959
Everyone's saying we gave
the most impressive presentation.

172
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,947
I heard the feedback is great.

173
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,785
It looks like we can get
this large-scale contract.

174
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,833
You'll have a lot of updates
for our shareholders.

175
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:17,250
Great work, sir.

176
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,539
Well, it's a given. This is nothing.

177
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,744
I can do this. I got this.

178
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,056
Yeong Sik, let's do this.
You can do it! Go!

179
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:34,845
Oh, my goodness.

180
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,339
I can do this. I can get rid of this!

181
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:43,451
I caught it. I'm so close. I can tell!

182
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,606
I did it!

183
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:48,639
Gosh, don't come!

184
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,818
Don't come anywhere near me.
Don't... My goodness.

185
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:53,039
He's so loud.

186
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,849
Yeong Sik, are you going to
keep making weird sounds?

187
00:09:56,938 --> 00:09:59,172
-Do you unclog with your mouth?
-I'm sorry, O Sol.

188
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,707
I don't want to be like this,
but it's fully saturated here.

189
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:04,982
I can jump over this.
Let's do it, Yeong Sik.

190
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,605
I can jump over it. Let's go.

191
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,682
Hey, you don't look okay.
Don't clean the restroom.

192
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,916
Go to that office over there and
clean the floor. Give me that.

193
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,675
No, O Sol. I can't do that.

194
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:27,419
I cannot leave you alone
in this battlefield.

195
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:29,648
That weird sound again.

196
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,750
Stop talking nonsense and just go.

197
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,309
What do people at this company eat?
There's so much poop in every toilet.

198
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,405
I can't even unclog them.

199
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,507
-I'll go find out what happened.
-Gosh, there's no need.

200
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,917
I heard the septic tank is broken.

201
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,550
I knew it.

202
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,417
Hwang Jae Min, that jerk...

203
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:46,813
Hey.

204
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:50,139
I'll kill you if you cause
trouble on our first day.

205
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:55,040
Gosh, why can't I sober up?

206
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,806
Gosh, seriously!

207
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,168
What did these jerks eat?

208
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,965
Do they poop all day or what?

209
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,894
They must be finishing up now.

210
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:16,075
It's their first day.
I hope everything is going well.

211
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:18,272
What's wrong?

212
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,457
Didn't you just hear that noise?

213
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:25,539
What... What noise, sir?

214
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:28,156
Well, it sounded like a scream...

215
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,583
...or a wild animal's howl.
Something like that.

216
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,332
No way. I'm sure you misheard it.

217
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,705
I must have, right?

218
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,496
There can't be a wild
animal in this building.

219
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:42,106
Okay, it'll work this time.

220
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,806
All right, I feel good about this one.

221
00:11:49,305 --> 00:11:51,338
Nice! Thank goodness.

222
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:58,425
Thank you. Thank you.

223
00:11:58,705 --> 00:11:59,838
Thank goodness.

224
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,410
I wondered why they made us
take the fitness test.

225
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:07,585
This is my first day, and this job
is already physically so taxing.

226
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:18,573
-This was your idea?
-That's amazing.

227
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,471
This is so cool.

228
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,906
That's so impressive.

229
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,005
-It's pretty good.
-Really?

230
00:12:24,305 --> 00:12:25,806
-Anything else? Show us.
-Other ideas?

231
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:39,639
And...

232
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,672
O Sol.

233
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:43,896
Have some coffee.

234
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,352
Thank you.

235
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:56,102
Excuse me. Can I get by, ma'am?

236
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:02,371
Sure.

237
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:05,172
There you go.

238
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,147
Did she just call me "ma'am"?

239
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,675
Does she think all cleaning staff are old?

240
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,751
-Are you all right?
-Gosh.

241
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,440
Why are you just standing around?
Clean this up.

242
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:20,038
Sorry?

243
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:21,839
-Gosh.
-Right.

244
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,012
Okay.

245
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,116
I even got coffee on my shoes.

246
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:34,545
Well, ma'am. Do you have wet wipes?

247
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:42,071
Here you go.

248
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:45,858
Well, don't call me "ma'am".

249
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,928
We're obviously around the same age.

250
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,706
Goodness, how annoying.

251
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,341
I'm wearing this for the first time.

252
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:56,273
There's still some coffee left
in that corner. Clean thoroughly.

253
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:58,572
Okay.

254
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:02,011
-Here too.
-Oh, here's some too.

255
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:05,193
My gosh, what are you doing now?
How gross.

256
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:08,883
I can't clean because you're
standing there. Move, will you?

257
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,121
-This will get stained, ma'am.
-What?

258
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,987
"Ma'am"? Did you just call me "ma'am"?

259
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,216
Yes, who else is here now?

260
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,050
How dare you call me "ma'am"?

261
00:14:21,138 --> 00:14:23,905
I'm baffled. I obviously
don't look that old.

262
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:26,050
My gosh, you're not that old?

263
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:29,739
I thought you deserved the title too
since you kept calling me "ma'am".

264
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,180
This is ridiculous.

265
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,466
You have too big of a pride
for a mere cleaning staff.

266
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,001
What did you just say?

267
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,934
"A mere cleaning staff"?

268
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:44,520
-Ms. Lee.

269
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,137
-Sir.

270
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:47,226
What are you doing here?

271
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,909
Well, that woman...

272
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,946
I mean, I spilled some
coffee on the floor.

273
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:57,730
I asked that lady to clean it
and she got mad at me all of a sudden.

274
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,112
-When did I...
-She could've just said no.

275
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,913
Instead, she kept hitting my shoes...

276
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,435
...with her dirty rag and told me to move.

277
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,745
-Are you from the cleaning company?
-Yes.

278
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:14,078
Didn't your manager
tell you that you mustn't...

279
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,245
-...inconvenience our employees?
-Pardon me?

280
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,145
How do they train their employees?

281
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,561
Why are you causing a
scene at our workplace?

282
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,612
Shall I call up the person in charge...
No.

283
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,733
Must I tell the CEO of that company...

284
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,535
-...to train his employees better?
-Well...

285
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,867
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,367
I wasn't sure what to do
as this is my first day.

287
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:39,834
I'll be careful from now on.

288
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,371
-See you later.
-Okay.

289
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,333
You heard that, right?

290
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,967
Wipe the coffee on the floor first.

291
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,168
And please throw out
that paper cup for me.

292
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,688
This too.

293
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:03,034
Ma'am.

294
00:16:04,066 --> 00:16:07,066
Everyone must clean up after themselves.

295
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,500
Where are you going, ma'am?

296
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:22,915
Clean up before you go.

297
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:24,173
Who?

298
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,467
Me?

299
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,501
There's no one else here that
should be called "ma'am".

300
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,913
My goodness, I'm speechless.

301
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,479
What are you talking about?

302
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:34,978
I'm obviously not that old.

303
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,530
-Ms. Lee Young Eun.
-Yes?

304
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,913
"Treat others the way you
want to be treated."

305
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,034
You know that, right?

306
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,158
Too bad. Unfortunately,

307
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:47,039
this area is not included in the contract.

308
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,466
We can do this much for free...

309
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,471
...but you'll have to take
care of the rest...

310
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,001
...yourself.

311
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,933
Make it neat.

312
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:00,901
Ms. Gil.

313
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,034
You don't have to do more
just because it's your first day.

314
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,001
Also, when you think it's unfair,

315
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,268
you don't have to apologize.

316
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,200
Do you understand?

317
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,145
We provide cleaning service.

318
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,571
But it doesn't mean
we have to lower ourselves.

319
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:20,300
Keep that in mind.

320
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:37,300
What a bad day. I can't believe it.

321
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,567
Hey, ma'am.

322
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:46,902
You heard that, right?

323
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,712
Here. I'll let you borrow
this rag this one time.

324
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,768
When you're done,
please return it to the supply room.

325
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,668
Got it, ma'am?

326
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,067
Excuse me now.

327
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,145
Wait.

328
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,300
Hey!

329
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,333
Clean that up.

330
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
How dare you...

331
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,068
Ma'am, aren't you going to...

332
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,134
Hey!

333
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,101
(Happiness, ambition)

334
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,168
What's that?

335
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,892
Bacteria tester.

336
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,034
(Measuring)

337
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:27,179
(Measuring)

338
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,434
(Value: 0)

339
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,767
Okay.

340
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,934
-Thank you for today!
-Thank you for today!

341
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,968
Let's go get our stuff.

342
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,879
Gosh, that was incredible.

343
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:51,901
Thought we were watching the CSI.

344
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,801
Exactly. They even have
a James Bond briefcase.

345
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,646
My head, shoulders, knees, feet...

346
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:00,934
My whole body is aching.

347
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,012
I hadn't done much
physical work in a while.

348
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,899
Every single muscle is revolting.

349
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,268
Gosh.

350
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:20,967
You have to pull these off
quickly to minimize the pain.

351
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,326
What's with you?

352
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:25,753
Gosh, my hair.

353
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,968
You don't have to thank me.

354
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,809
We're neighbors, you know.

355
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,301
What are you doing here alone?

356
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,134
Why don't you ask your dad
or O Dol for help?

357
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,779
Never tell my dad...

358
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,945
...you saw me here.

359
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:41,634
Don't tell O Dol either.

360
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,201
Why? Did you do something bad?

361
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:47,834
-I'm not like you.
-Me?

362
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:50,469
-What do you mean?
-Forget it.

363
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:52,600
I can't even look after myself.

364
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:54,795
I'm not in the position
to give advice to anyone.

365
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,220
Give it to me.

366
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,688
Let me help.

367
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,068
Forget it.

368
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,833
-I'll do it.
-I don't need your help.

369
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,512
You pretend to be so tough,

370
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,534
but you're actually weak on the inside.

371
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,268
What?

372
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,779
What do you know about me?

373
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,618
You might not know about me,

374
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:27,748
but as soon as I see someone,

375
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:30,113
I can see through that person's...

376
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,546
...worries and thoughts.

377
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:33,667
Just by looking at the person.

378
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:35,894
I'm sure you can.

379
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:40,667
Are you a fortune teller or something?

380
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,082
No.

381
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:44,472
Wait.

382
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,735
Are you really a fortune
teller or something?

383
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:50,568
You know the fortune teller
at the intersection too.

384
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,300
It must be right.

385
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,833
So how do I look?

386
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,148
Will I get a boyfriend this year?

387
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,678
What about jobs?

388
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,268
Fortune tellers can't predict the future.

389
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,179
All they can do is take a guess
based on the person's past.

390
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,045
I knew it.

391
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,646
You really are a fortune teller.

392
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:15,568
Then take a guess at least.

393
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,200
We're neighbors, you know.

394
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,267
I don't usually tell
these things to anyone.

395
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,301
I see a very important
person in the northeast.

396
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:32,734
He's very tall.

397
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,933
His face looks...

398
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,611
...pretty good too.

399
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,879
In the northeast?

400
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:44,746
The stars... Which direction is it?

401
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,179
Which...

402
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:47,768
-Use an app.
-Right.

403
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,301
Did you say northeast?

404
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,567
Gosh.

405
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,900
I'm late!

406
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,967
Gosh, what should I do?

407
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:27,834
It hurts.

408
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:31,001
My goodness.

409
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,145
Hey!

410
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:41,300
Get out of my way.

411
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,300
Gosh.

412
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,412
What are you going to do about your hair?
Shouldn't you wash it?

413
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,567
My hair?

414
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,234
Hey, does it look okay now?

415
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,900
Dad, give me my breakfast!

416
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:07,022
-I'm leaving.
-Take that towel off your neck!

417
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,099
Sir!

418
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,934
Sir! Stop!

419
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,099
Wait! Sir!

420
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:37,300
Wait!

421
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,879
I missed the bus. What should I do?

422
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:45,134
The fine dust level in Seoul
is very low this morning.

423
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:47,709
You can finally see clear skies.

424
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:50,783
Why don't you go outside...

425
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:53,412
...and enjoy some
outdoor activities today?

426
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,067
What should I do?

427
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,492
Mr. Jang!

428
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:04,667
Mr. Jang.

429
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:09,962
Mr. Jang.

430
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,790
You're going to the office, right?
Lucky me.

431
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,713
Can you give me a ride? Like a carpool.

432
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,267
Let me open the door.

433
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,345
I think it's locked.

434
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,466
It won't open.

435
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:28,546
Mr. Jang.

436
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,945
-Mr. Jang.
-I can't let her get in my car.

437
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:32,409
Mr. Jang!

438
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:35,537
Mr. Jang! Mr. CEO!

439
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,047
Hey!

440
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,295
Gosh.

441
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:42,012
I can't believe him.

442
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:44,134
What time is it? My goodness.

443
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,745
Taxi!

444
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,056
She smeared something all over my car.

445
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,946
What are you doing so early?

446
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:28,287
Gosh.

447
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:36,798
What?

448
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:39,599
Is there something on my face?

449
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:41,962
No.

450
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,332
I'm just curious about something.

451
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:48,565
Do women put on makeup on their hair too?

452
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:50,543
-Sorry?
-I'm sure it wasn't dandruff...

453
00:26:50,631 --> 00:26:53,031
...but there was white powder
on her hair...

454
00:26:54,352 --> 00:26:56,376
...and the sesame oil from
gimbap was still on her lips.

455
00:26:56,464 --> 00:26:59,209
Is it also a recent trend
to wrap your neck with a towel...

456
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,719
...like a scarf?

457
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:04,331
I don't know what you're talking about.

458
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:08,909
I'll take that.

459
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,130
It's nothing.

460
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:21,231
What was that?

461
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:25,590
-Hello.
-You're here, O Sol.

462
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,779
I'm not late, am I?

463
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:28,376
That towel.

464
00:27:31,898 --> 00:27:33,998
It's because I worked out this morning.

465
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,643
It's nothing. Go on in. You're not late.

466
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,165
Thank you. I'll see you later.

467
00:27:50,564 --> 00:27:52,976
Hey, if you bumped into me looking
like that in the morning,

468
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:54,676
I would've run away too.

469
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:57,732
Your appearance in the morning
is quite far from normal.

470
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,942
Hey. Even if that's true,

471
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,882
it'd be convenient to carpool
each other when we can.

472
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,593
Is it because he's a CEO
and I'm just an employee?

473
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:10,365
Gosh, he has such poor character.

474
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:14,521
Consider your own character
before judging others, you brat.

475
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,144
Isn't today your company's
first get-together?

476
00:28:16,598 --> 00:28:19,032
You better watch how much you drink, okay?

477
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,131
Of course. I'm going to be extra careful.

478
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,631
By the way,

479
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:27,309
did that jerk Lee Do Jin ever contact you?

480
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:29,098
What? Lee Do Jin?

481
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,476
I'm already in a foul
mood since this morning.

482
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,076
Why are you mentioning that name?

483
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:38,376
I met some of my friends last night.

484
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:41,065
I think that jerk broke up
with his girlfriend.

485
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:45,676
I heard he kept mentioning you
and said he made a big mistake...

486
00:28:45,764 --> 00:28:48,317
...so that everyone can hear.
That obnoxious jerk.

487
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,432
He's having regrets now.

488
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,976
That jerk is so sneaky.
He's trying to hit on you again.

489
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:55,698
He thinks he can get any girl he wants.

490
00:28:55,865 --> 00:28:59,376
You better not answer
the phone if he calls you.

491
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,676
-Do you understand?
-Hey. Do you think I'm insane?

492
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:05,265
Okay. Maybe I shouldn't have
mentioned it, since you're fine now.

493
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,067
Where are you?

494
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,531
Why is it so noisy in the background?

495
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,949
Where do you think? I'm here
to watch O Dol's match.

496
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,108
O Dol's match?

497
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,464
Hey. How could you call
yourself his older sister?

498
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:18,754
Today's the preliminary round...

499
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:21,059
...of your brother's
taekwondo competition.

500
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:24,197
Thanks, Ju Yeon. You're the best.

501
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:27,998
Hey. It's O Dol's turn. Let's talk later.

502
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:32,576
(Let's go, Gil O Dol!)

503
00:29:32,664 --> 00:29:33,731
Let's go!

504
00:29:39,297 --> 00:29:40,898
How are you doing?

505
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,741
If you have time, do you want to meet up?

506
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:48,787
I want to apologize about
what happened last time.

507
00:29:53,397 --> 00:29:55,331
Beat him up!

508
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:58,698
Gil O Dol! Gil O Dol!

509
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:00,965
Gil O Dol!

510
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:05,530
Red corner wins!

511
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,370
I love you, Gil O Dol!

512
00:30:12,264 --> 00:30:14,128
I'm so proud of you!

513
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:17,042
(Welcoming Party for New Cleaning Fairies)

514
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,685
It's here again?
I'm so sick of this place.

515
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,098
Can't we just go to a barbecue restaurant?

516
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:25,098
This place is so nice and neat.

517
00:30:25,364 --> 00:30:26,343
I know.

518
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:28,994
It's totally neat, right?
Why am I not surprised?

519
00:30:29,297 --> 00:30:31,909
Our CEO doesn't care about
the tastes of his new employees...

520
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,598
...and chooses places that are neat...

521
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:36,268
...without asking any questions.
How typical.

522
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:39,705
Hello, you cute little snapper.

523
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:43,885
You're so glossy and smooth,
you must be from an ocean far away.

524
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,610
They even have abalones and innards.

525
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:52,212
Look at this colorful combination.
How pretty.

526
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,410
What is that? It looks
so neat and organized...

527
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,743
-That's Mr. Jang's...
-He's here.

528
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:01,998
Hello, Mr. Jang.

529
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,983
-Hello, sir.
-Let's take our seats.

530
00:31:04,498 --> 00:31:06,099
-Sit down.
-Okay.

531
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,810
Miss Gil O Sol.

532
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:26,437
I'm left-handed, so it might
be uncomfortable for us both,

533
00:31:27,134 --> 00:31:28,334
so why don't you sit somewhere else?

534
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:31,393
What?

535
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:34,965
Okay, sure.

536
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:41,370
Miss Gil O Sol.

537
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:45,503
My legs are a bit long and
our knees might touch.

538
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:48,798
How about finding another seat?

539
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:50,898
What about...

540
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:54,246
that seat, way over there?

541
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:57,765
Okay.

542
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,098
Excuse me.

543
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,764
Let me pour you a drink.

544
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,877
Did you fill up your glasses?

545
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:23,820
Enjoy the food tonight...

546
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:27,345
...and I hope you do your very best
at Cleaning Fairy from now on.

547
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,521
Let's go, Cleaning Fairy!

548
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,010
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

549
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:43,598
Excuse me,

550
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,865
what is wrong with Mr. Jang?

551
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,342
I knew he was a neat person,
but isn't that a bit too much?

552
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:52,838
Let him be. No one can change who he is.

553
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,648
Why do you think he established
a cleaning company?

554
00:32:56,023 --> 00:32:58,190
It must be tiring to be around
someone so obsessively neat.

555
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:08,976
Guys, I have something to say.

556
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,542
Since we'll be working
together from now on,

557
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,332
why don't we have a drink
and become friends?

558
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:14,926
-Shall we?
-Does that sound good?

559
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,896
Yeong Sik, what are you doing?
Pour your seniors a drink.

560
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,231
-Okay.
-Come on.

561
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:24,208
Here, have a drink.

562
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:25,364
Forget it.

563
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:27,264
Pour me a drink.

564
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:29,133
Pour a drink for your superior.

565
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,098
Here you go.

566
00:33:33,664 --> 00:33:34,964
You cocky jerk.

567
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:37,797
-I'll pour you a glass.
-Thanks.

568
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:42,475
Don't forget to drink the whole glass.
Bottoms up!

569
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,065
Bottoms up!

570
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:52,731
O Sol is bright and gets along
very well with our members.

571
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,102
I have a great judge of character, right?

572
00:33:57,898 --> 00:34:00,365
Try this. It's delicious.

573
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,598
What about this?

574
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:04,031
-This is delicious.
-Slow down.

575
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:05,531
This tastes amazing.

576
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,198
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

577
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,497
This is really delicious.

578
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,431
Thank you.

579
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,530
Let's go for a second round.

580
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,731
Let's go!

581
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,402
-Let's go!
-Quiet down!

582
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:34,464
Yes?

583
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:36,945
Ye Joon?

584
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:41,179
Okay, I'll go to the hospital right away.
Okay.

585
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:43,777
You look like a total alcoholic,

586
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:46,261
but how could you get this drunk
after a half bottle of soju?

587
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,220
You're too drunk.
Can you find your way home?

588
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,481
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,810
Something urgent came up at home,
I have to go.

590
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:56,154
Don't worry. We'll take
care of things here.

591
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:57,076
Thank you.

592
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:59,429
Tell Mr. Jang I left when he comes out.

593
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:01,313
-Okay.
-Thanks.

594
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:04,374
What are you doing?

595
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:06,538
Do something about him.
He's strong as an ox.

596
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,594
-Don't go.
-Let go of me!

597
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,646
(Do Jin)

598
00:35:21,598 --> 00:35:24,432
You should've treated me nicely
when you had the chance, idiot.

599
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,965
You lost your chance!

600
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:31,632
Idiot. It's too late now.

601
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,355
I told you. You lost your chance!

602
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:43,341
I'm sick of the same
old thing, every year.

603
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:48,709
Oh my goodness.

604
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:50,376
What are you doing here? Alone?

605
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,850
Where is everyone else?

606
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:56,788
Mr. Jang, do you want
to go for one more drink?

607
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,343
-What?
-After eating all that sushi,

608
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,810
I'm feeling rather hungry.

609
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:05,399
Why don't we go to
a snack cart near here...

610
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,192
...and have some hot udon...

611
00:36:07,281 --> 00:36:10,164
...and grilled eels? What do you think?

612
00:36:10,988 --> 00:36:12,208
Answer the phone.

613
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,446
Where did you go? Answer the phone!

614
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:17,275
Don't be like that.

615
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,176
Come on, let's go have one more drink.

616
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,338
-Okay, stay right there.
-Where is everyone?

617
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:24,055
-Yeong Sik!
-The phone is turned off.

618
00:36:24,144 --> 00:36:26,651
-Why is your phone turned off?
-Where did everyone go?

619
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,931
We have to go for a second round!
Yeong Sik...

620
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,197
Come on, Mr. Jang.

621
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:33,998
I know a snack cart right over there.

622
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:36,209
Hold on.

623
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:39,076
-Let's go!
-Gil...

624
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,575
Gosh, this is crazy.

625
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,068
-Ms. Gil.
-Gosh, come on.

626
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,920
Catch me if you can!

627
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:51,536
Gosh, she must've lost her mind.

628
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:53,937
Wait, calm down.

629
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,437
Ms. Gil, stop.

630
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:57,736
Where did everyone go?

631
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,748
Ms. Gil, come here.

632
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,303
-Okay, I heard you. Stop, will you?
-Come on.

633
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:03,415
Come here.

634
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:04,603
All right.

635
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,303
Gosh, Ms. Gil.

636
00:37:07,636 --> 00:37:08,594
Watch out!

637
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:25,869
Gosh, Ms. Gil.

638
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,622
Do you see that girl over there?
She passed out.

639
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:39,103
She's cute. Let's go check her out.

640
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:41,551
Excuse me.

641
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,149
Where do you live?

642
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:45,082
Shall we take you home?

643
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,115
-Would you come with us? Come on.
-Let's go.

644
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:48,214
Come on, let's go.

645
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,368
-1, 2. There we go.
-Let us take you home.

646
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,115
-Who are you guys?
-What?

647
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,715
-It's okay.
-Don't worry. Let's go.

648
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:54,836
Gosh.

649
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,255
Let go of her.

650
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,634
Didn't you hear me?

651
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:05,300
I told you to let go of her.

652
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,035
Gosh.

653
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,377
My gosh.

654
00:38:13,623 --> 00:38:15,656
-Sir.
-Ms. Gil.

655
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,341
What are you doing here?

656
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:19,589
Oh, but...

657
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:23,655
Mr. Jang is here.

658
00:38:23,795 --> 00:38:25,413
Sir.

659
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:28,336
That is not me, so just get over here.

660
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:30,990
Ms. Gil.

661
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:33,689
Come here.

662
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,823
Can her head be...

663
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,790
Gosh.

664
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,129
She's driving me crazy.

665
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,124
She keeps resting her head on
spots without the plastic cover.

666
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:06,489
Gosh.

667
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:28,856
That startled me.

668
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:30,856
Goodness.

669
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:36,924
Have you sobered up a little?

670
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:41,656
Do you... Do you have a plastic bag?

671
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:43,268
I need a plastic bag.

672
00:39:43,356 --> 00:39:44,756
What... What did you say?

673
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:46,535
Don't tell me you're about
to do what I'm thinking.

674
00:39:46,623 --> 00:39:48,565
-No, you can't. No way.
-Gosh...

675
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:51,925
I'm feeling so queasy right now.

676
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:54,926
No, hold it. Try to hold it, okay?

677
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:57,634
I'll pull over. I'll pull the car over.

678
00:39:57,723 --> 00:39:59,330
Hold it, okay? You can do it.

679
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:03,818
No. I'll actually kill you
if you throw up inside my car!

680
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,357
No, please. No!

681
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:13,368
Gosh, please don't.

682
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,294
I really can't...
I don't think I can hold it.

683
00:40:17,383 --> 00:40:19,132
-Gosh, I'm so nauseated...
-No.

684
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:20,435
You can definitely hold it.

685
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:22,890
We all suppress such urges.

686
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,046
Do this, okay? Take a deep breath.

687
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:27,690
Say, "I can hold it."

688
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:30,937
"I can do this."

689
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,157
"I'm calm and relaxed." See? It's working.

690
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:38,835
My, you're doing a great job.

691
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,204
Oh, boy. That's passed.

692
00:40:59,163 --> 00:41:00,263
What's this...

693
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,156
Did you throw up just now?

694
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,318
The windows... Right, the fine dust.

695
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:18,589
Help!

696
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:21,122
Help...

697
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:25,323
It smells like you threw up.

698
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:29,869
Gosh, don't move. Don't come near me!
Stay away!

699
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:32,324
Don't come... Gosh, go away!

700
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,921
Oh, I know where we are.

701
00:41:41,989 --> 00:41:44,823
Right after this corner,

702
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:47,692
you'll see my place. My house.

703
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:50,536
We're here.

704
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,066
What's with this neighborhood?

705
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:54,135
Not a single soul is walking by.

706
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,256
I'm exhausted.

707
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,466
Since you came all the way here,

708
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:06,462
you should come in for another drink.

709
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:07,890
Are you in?

710
00:42:08,698 --> 00:42:10,132
-Yes?
-O Sol.

711
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:17,189
What?

712
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:20,123
It's that jerk.

713
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,039
You didn't get my message?

714
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:23,446
I've been waiting for a long time.

715
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:26,457
I couldn't get a hold of you,
so I was worried.

716
00:42:27,956 --> 00:42:30,033
You jerk.

717
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:31,735
What are you doing here?

718
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:33,034
Leave.

719
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:36,139
I have nothing to say to you.

720
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:38,723
Did you drink a lot?

721
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:45,882
Who are you?

722
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:48,322
I'm Ms. Gil's...

723
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:50,909
...boss.

724
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,602
Have we met before?

725
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:00,243
I'm not sure.

726
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,370
I can't quite recall.

727
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:08,867
Thank you for walking O Sol home.

728
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,491
It's getting late, so you should go.

729
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,404
Let's go, O Sol.
I'll walk you to your place.

730
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:20,489
Hey.

731
00:43:21,323 --> 00:43:23,435
Let go of my hand, will you?

732
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:25,623
-Come on.
-You'd better let go of my hand.

733
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,635
You little...

734
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:29,134
Let's go, okay?

735
00:43:29,222 --> 00:43:31,389
Gosh, I don't want to!

736
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,656
I said, let go!

737
00:43:34,057 --> 00:43:36,057
-Come on.
-I don't want to go with you.

738
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:37,423
Let go of me.

739
00:43:37,523 --> 00:43:39,568
I said, let go!

740
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:42,624
I said I don't want to go with you.
Leave me alone!

741
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,457
It doesn't look like
she wants your company.

742
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,635
Since she's my employee,

743
00:43:56,723 --> 00:43:58,624
I will walk her to her place.

744
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:18,723
What's wrong with you two?

745
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:23,322
Hey, you have to let me borrow
it when you're done, okay?

746
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,324
This is PG-19.

747
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,701
That's obviously why I want to borrow it.

748
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,257
Come on. You know.

749
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,550
Isn't that your sister?

750
00:44:44,856 --> 00:44:46,056
Let go of her hand.

751
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,491
You let go of her hand first.

752
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:51,689
O Sol.

753
00:44:55,189 --> 00:44:56,322
What's happening here?

754
00:44:58,623 --> 00:44:59,656
Hey, O Dol.

755
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,201
Oh, the rooftop pervert is here too.

756
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,457
Hi.

757
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,564
What are you doing here?

758
00:45:15,289 --> 00:45:17,923
My gosh, it looks like you drank again.

759
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,790
Stop.

760
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:23,023
Don't get any closer.

761
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,904
"Don't get any closer"?

762
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:33,458
Are you Ms. Gil O Sol's little brother?

763
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:35,961
Yes, I am. O Sol, who are these guys?

764
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:39,390
That's great.

765
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,457
Please take her home.

766
00:45:48,523 --> 00:45:49,690
O Sol.

767
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:53,090
-Is there any alcohol at home?
-There might be some left.

768
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:54,456
Good.

769
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:57,123
O Dol!

770
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,556
That jerk...

771
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,224
Is he a jerk?

772
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:04,856
What's this?

773
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,969
It's tteokbokki.

774
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,491
-Hey!
-Where are you going?

775
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:14,990
Mr. Jang!

776
00:46:16,101 --> 00:46:17,168
Wait!

777
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,620
Stop!

778
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:23,247
Ms. Gil.

779
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,191
Thank you for the ride.

780
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:31,189
It's nothing.

781
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,190
Well...

782
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,723
This is not much,

783
00:46:36,856 --> 00:46:38,496
but take it.

784
00:46:38,723 --> 00:46:41,802
-It's for the ride.
-It's okay.

785
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,167
Thank you.

786
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,990
For the ride?

787
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:53,356
My goodness.

788
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:26,423
Thank you!

789
00:47:27,356 --> 00:47:31,190
That's all I can give you.

790
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,786
Gil O Sol.

791
00:47:40,323 --> 00:47:41,690
Gil O Sol!

792
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,823
Hey!

793
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:05,638
Really?

794
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:10,367
Two guys were fighting over me?

795
00:48:10,456 --> 00:48:11,556
Yes.

796
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:13,101
What?

797
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:15,856
Why am I so popular?

798
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,790
Too bad I don't remember it.

799
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:24,190
Stop drinking so much.

800
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:25,890
This happens every time you drink.

801
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:28,124
How dare you lecture me?

802
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:30,468
It's so nice of your boss.

803
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:31,935
He gave you a ride home.

804
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:34,268
By the way, didn't we buy...

805
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:36,677
...both tteokbokki and sundae last night?

806
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:40,656
Where did the sundae go?

807
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,794
What? Why are you looking at me?

808
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,585
It's not me.

809
00:48:54,423 --> 00:48:57,535
I wasn't even feeling well.
Why would I have wanted sundae?

810
00:48:58,089 --> 00:48:59,068
Mr. Jang!

811
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:00,835
This is not much, but...

812
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:02,757
Thank you!

813
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:08,290
One must cleanse others' flaws...

814
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,583
...and not hate others' faults.

815
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:15,557
"One must cleanse others' flaws..."

816
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:19,734
Mr. Jang, let's have another drink.

817
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,574
"And not hate..."

818
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:25,389
No!

819
00:49:26,436 --> 00:49:27,836
"Others' faults."

820
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:30,401
Mr. Jang!

821
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,124
Every relationship...

822
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:43,695
...has a meaning.

823
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,424
"Every relationship..."

824
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,224
"...has a meaning."

825
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:52,001
Hold hands...

826
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,756
...and walk the path together.

827
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:58,529
"Hold hands and walk the path..."

828
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:00,757
"Walk the path together."

829
00:50:02,656 --> 00:50:03,723
"Walk the path together"?

830
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:07,256
"Walk the path together"?

831
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,924
Gil O Sol.

832
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:15,157
Walk the path together.

833
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:16,990
The section will be played in a loop.

834
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,866
-Walk the path together.
-What?

835
00:50:20,013 --> 00:50:22,447
-Walk the path together.
-What's wrong?

836
00:50:22,672 --> 00:50:24,939
-Walk the path together.
-Hey!

837
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,702
-Walk the path together.
-Go away!

838
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,301
Walk the path together.

839
00:50:30,389 --> 00:50:31,689
Walk the path...

840
00:50:33,323 --> 00:50:35,933
I'm sorry about yesterday.

841
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:38,173
My kid suddenly got sick.

842
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:41,423
Ms. Kwon.

843
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:46,200
Do you know what food
I hate the most in the world?

844
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:48,479
-Food?
-It's sundae.

845
00:50:48,568 --> 00:50:51,234
It's made of pig intestines and blood.

846
00:50:51,323 --> 00:50:52,723
The mushy,

847
00:50:52,812 --> 00:50:56,720
steaming, and smelly sundae.

848
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,357
What is this all about?

849
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:02,823
Ms. Kwon.

850
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,399
Has anyone ever given you
sundae in return for a ride?

851
00:51:09,189 --> 00:51:10,256
Sorry?

852
00:51:12,623 --> 00:51:14,271
Did something happen last night?

853
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:21,596
If I say anything more,
I might collapse from high blood pressure.

854
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:23,823
Seon Gyeol!

855
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:27,068
I would have let you know,
but Ms. Cha didn't want me to.

856
00:51:27,156 --> 00:51:30,268
I knew you'd tell me not to come.
That's why I didn't say anything.

857
00:51:30,356 --> 00:51:31,489
Here I am.

858
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:35,259
Are you Mae Hwa's only son...

859
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:36,894
...who gives her so many headaches?

860
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:41,582
Introduce yourself. Chairman Yang
runs golf resorts in Southeast Asia.

861
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:43,224
It wasn't easy to bring him here.

862
00:51:43,313 --> 00:51:46,380
Nice to meet you. You're so
good-looking just like your mom.

863
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,001
So why are you here?

864
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:50,074
I'm sure you're not here on a date.

865
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:52,643
Why don't you say
what you have to say and leave?

866
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:54,390
I'm sorry.

867
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:56,190
He's a bit shy.

868
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,601
You're still looking for
investors, aren't you?

869
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,902
Chairman Yang would love to help you.
That's why I brought him.

870
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,301
He wanted to look around the office
and have a talk with you.

871
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:05,602
Tell me if you need anything.

872
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,969
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for Ms. Cha's son.

873
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:09,124
It's okay.

874
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,382
I appreciate your offer,
but I'll have to decline it.

875
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:19,658
What's this place?

876
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,090
I can take care of myself.
Please leave me alone.

877
00:52:33,189 --> 00:52:35,732
You can take care of yourself?
I've run a business too.

878
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:37,400
It's the same with everything
else in the world.

879
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:39,368
There's nothing you can do on your own.

880
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,572
-You need others' help...
-Why?

881
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,834
Why is there nothing I can do on my own?

882
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:46,702
I've been doing everything
on my own all my life.

883
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,029
Why can't I run my own business on my own?

884
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:51,434
What are you trying to say?

885
00:52:51,523 --> 00:52:53,455
After neglecting me all these years,

886
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:55,224
what are you doing right now?

887
00:52:55,323 --> 00:52:56,557
You suddenly showed up...

888
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,568
...to play mom?

889
00:52:58,656 --> 00:52:59,610
What?

890
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:02,346
To play mom?

891
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,923
I can't believe it.

892
00:53:06,256 --> 00:53:07,159
Yes.

893
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,386
I want to play mom.

894
00:53:09,523 --> 00:53:10,802
I felt bad about neglecting you,

895
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:13,524
so I want to put things right.
What's so wrong about that?

896
00:53:14,242 --> 00:53:16,788
I can't give you any money
because of your grandpa,

897
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:19,981
so I'm asking my boyfriend to help my son.

898
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,971
Other parents say they're afraid
their children will ask for help.

899
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:25,590
But I'm trying to do
everything I can for you.

900
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,969
How could you say that?

901
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:29,440
So just leave.

902
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:32,134
When I missed you and needed you,
you were never there.

903
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:33,732
Why you have to do this now?

904
00:53:33,821 --> 00:53:34,921
Because I feel bad.

905
00:53:35,623 --> 00:53:37,357
It's because I feel bad!

906
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:53,356
You brat.

907
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:56,010
I wouldn't do this if you
were living a normal life.

908
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,000
Why can't you date and get
married like ordinary people?

909
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:00,404
Why can't you!

910
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:11,590
Mr. Jang.

911
00:54:15,348 --> 00:54:16,615
Well...

912
00:54:19,023 --> 00:54:22,290
I'm sorry about yesterday.

913
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,750
(Do Jin)

914
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:55,779
Over here.

915
00:55:12,194 --> 00:55:13,507
Thank you for meeting me.

916
00:55:13,596 --> 00:55:15,212
I was worried you might not come.

917
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,297
By the way, why didn't you
tell me you found a job?

918
00:55:20,222 --> 00:55:22,322
I don't think anyone else
knew about it either.

919
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,289
I felt no need to tell them about it.

920
00:55:28,622 --> 00:55:30,400
What kind of company is it?

921
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:32,443
It's a small but solid company.

922
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:35,032
The employees are great,
and it has a promising future.

923
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:39,275
I see. You prepared so hard,
and I'm happy for you.

924
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:40,756
Congratulations, O Sol.

925
00:55:42,356 --> 00:55:43,723
Aren't you hungry?

926
00:55:44,088 --> 00:55:45,232
We'd like to order.

927
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:47,988
O Sol, what about some vongole pasta?

928
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:52,268
Hold on. We'll order a bit later.

929
00:55:52,356 --> 00:55:53,489
I'm sorry.

930
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:57,268
I wanted to tell you on the phone,

931
00:55:57,472 --> 00:56:00,106
but I decided it would be
better to tell you in person.

932
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:04,395
Don't contact me from now on.

933
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:07,297
Stop coming abruptly to my house...

934
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:10,340
...and don't ask me
to come out like this anymore.

935
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:11,596
What's wrong, O Sol?

936
00:56:12,156 --> 00:56:14,001
I just wanted to apologize.

937
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:16,635
I was too careless last time.

938
00:56:16,723 --> 00:56:18,502
We've known each other for so long.

939
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:21,657
It hurt me to think we'd
never see each other again.

940
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,568
Can we just get along like we used to...

941
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:25,823
I had a crush on you for three years.

942
00:56:27,062 --> 00:56:28,696
And after what happened,

943
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:31,208
I finally realized the truth.

944
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:35,929
If this is...

945
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:39,491
...because you broke up
with your girlfriend...

946
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,233
...or if you feel regret and
think I'm easy to hit on...

947
00:56:49,178 --> 00:56:50,679
...please stop.

948
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:56,437
I'm not that stupid girl who always...

949
00:56:56,526 --> 00:56:58,293
...had a crush on you like before.

950
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:04,057
Do you have a boyfriend now?

951
00:57:05,091 --> 00:57:06,351
Is it that guy from last night?

952
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:07,813
The guy who walked you home?

953
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:13,357
I knew it. It's rare for a
boss at work to act like that.

954
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:15,622
I didn't even know that. How stupid of me.

955
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:19,435
Since you know now, don't call me anymore.

956
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,556
I'm busy with work...

957
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:24,657
No,

958
00:57:26,489 --> 00:57:28,602
I don't want to see you anymore.

959
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:30,681
I hope we never see each other again.

960
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:32,423
I really mean it.

961
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:07,990
Are you finished washing...

962
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:09,523
Oh, dear.

963
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:11,057
My goodness.

964
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:12,990
Let me see.

965
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,057
Your skin is coming off.

966
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,000
Young Master, what's wrong?

967
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:19,401
Please stop this.

968
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:20,502
Give it back.

969
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,590
My mom told me she'll
return if I stay clean.

970
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:27,796
If I stay dirty,
she'll never return to see me.

971
00:58:28,323 --> 00:58:29,623
My gosh.

972
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,923
Oh, dear.

973
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,067
Good job, O Sol.

974
00:58:44,156 --> 00:58:45,523
This feels so satisfying.

975
00:58:55,756 --> 00:58:57,190
Mr. Jang.

976
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:03,112
Do you live near here?

977
00:59:03,523 --> 00:59:06,057
My house is up that way too.

978
00:59:07,623 --> 00:59:10,190
I guess you already know,
since you walked me home.

979
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,157
By the way, earlier today...

980
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:17,990
...I didn't intend to hear you on purpose.

981
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,756
I went to apologize for being drunk
and hassling you last night.

982
00:59:24,256 --> 00:59:26,124
I'm sorry about the bad timing.

983
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,257
Don't worry about it.

984
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:29,823
Wait a minute.

985
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:38,217
Was the woman I saw today your mother?

986
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,911
She was very pretty.

987
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:43,489
You never know...

988
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,614
...when someone's beside you.

989
00:59:47,552 --> 00:59:49,353
You believe they'll
always be by your side.

990
00:59:50,856 --> 00:59:51,956
But...

991
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,184
...there's nothing that stays
by your side forever.

992
00:59:58,033 --> 00:59:59,233
Even your parents.

993
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,123
That's what I felt.

994
01:00:03,356 --> 01:00:05,435
What is it you want to say?

995
01:00:05,756 --> 01:00:08,457
Well, it's just...

996
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,623
I just meant...

997
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:16,132
...your mother seemed to love you dearly.

998
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:23,157
Don't worry about other people's
business, and get going.

999
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:26,324
Your neighborhood seemed
quite dangerous at night.

1000
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:39,993
Hello?

1001
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:42,456
Yes.

1002
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,322
Thank you.

1003
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:46,356
Oh.

1004
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:50,057
Heck no.

1005
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:51,255
Hey.

1006
01:00:51,675 --> 01:00:54,775
Do you think I went there
because I like him?

1007
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,489
I've grown up too.

1008
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,789
I told him I have a boyfriend
and not to call me anymore.

1009
01:01:03,423 --> 01:01:05,224
I'm serious.

1010
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:07,990
I'm telling you, it's true.

1011
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:10,556
O Sol.

1012
01:01:17,057 --> 01:01:18,224
Do Jin.

1013
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:25,807
The company you're working
at is a cleaning agency?

1014
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:29,331
You said it's a small but solid company.

1015
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,388
You have a knack for surprising people.

1016
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:36,946
What about work? Does it suit you well?

1017
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,190
Of course. It's fun too.

1018
01:01:41,058 --> 01:01:42,067
I'm glad.

1019
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:45,801
Then that boss of yours that I saw.

1020
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,791
Did you meet him while you were cleaning?

1021
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,057
I guess everyone has a match
somewhere in this world, right?

1022
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:55,857
He is...

1023
01:01:57,229 --> 01:01:58,996
...the CEO of our company.

1024
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:01,201
He's not someone you can mock like that.

1025
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:02,235
The CEO?

1026
01:02:03,392 --> 01:02:06,759
I doubt a CEO will go out with you.

1027
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,790
Did you ask him to act
as if he's your boyfriend?

1028
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:12,981
After I called you that day?

1029
01:02:15,571 --> 01:02:16,604
What did you say?

1030
01:02:16,693 --> 01:02:18,826
Now I see. Who will date someone like you?

1031
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:24,592
What's wrong with someone like me?

1032
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:26,335
-How could you say...
-No.

1033
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:27,823
Forget it.

1034
01:02:27,923 --> 01:02:29,357
Pretend you didn't hear that.

1035
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:36,335
Well, if it makes you uncomfortable,
I won't call you from now on.

1036
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:39,890
And I won't tell anyone
that I saw you today.

1037
01:02:40,122 --> 01:02:41,623
I know it'll be embarrassing for you.

1038
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:42,923
Embarrassing?

1039
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:45,607
Why would I be embarrassed?

1040
01:02:45,723 --> 01:02:46,990
Well, that's...

1041
01:02:47,968 --> 01:02:51,368
And your CEO really sounds
like a total loser.

1042
01:02:52,074 --> 01:02:54,074
Acting like a boyfriend
when he's actually not?

1043
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:06,435
He is my boyfriend.

1044
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:11,348
Unlike you, who looks down on
those who do this kind of work,

1045
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:13,690
he's a wonderful person.

1046
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,299
There he comes now.

1047
01:03:27,814 --> 01:03:28,981
Honey!

1048
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm sorry. Did you wait for long?

1049
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:38,815
What is this, Miss Gil O Sol?

1050
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:41,168
This is my boyfriend.

1051
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:43,188
I told you he's the CEO of our company.

1052
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:47,831
Have you lost your mind?

1053
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:51,405
I'm sorry. Can you please just act along?

1054
01:03:56,895 --> 01:03:58,129
We've met again.

1055
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,939
Yes, we have.

1056
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:11,383
But you two seem so awkward
around each other for lovers.

1057
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:13,547
You're not even holding hands.

1058
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:23,090
Gosh, seriously...

1059
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,757
Honey, you're upset because
I made you wait again.

1060
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,790
Right?

1061
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:42,090
Please help me just this once.

1062
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,435
No, I don't want to.

1063
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:48,523
I mean, how could I...

1064
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,090
...help you with this?

1065
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:54,925
I guess you and your boyfriend
don't get along.

1066
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:05,902
I'm sorry. Let me borrow
it just this once.

1067
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:08,341
What? Borrow what...

1068
01:05:41,923 --> 01:05:43,657
(Northeast)

1069
01:05:49,556 --> 01:05:50,556
There we go.

1070
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,587
My goodness.

1071
01:06:02,122 --> 01:06:03,048
What was that about?

1072
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:04,504
Cheers.

1074
01:06:32,249 --> 01:06:34,929
Why do I have to get roped
into your complicated love life...

1075
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:37,702
...and go through all this? Why?

1076
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,701
What's the matter with O Sol?

1077
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,823
Today is their mom's death anniversary.

1078
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:45,001
-Gross Gil?
-You don't seem well these days.

1079
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:46,835
Why don't you see a therapist?

1080
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:48,802
I'm going crazy. I must've lost my mind.

1081
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:51,835
I'm no expert, but they say
it's caused by the mind.

1082
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:52,969
You're lovesick.

1083
01:06:53,057 --> 01:06:56,602
You made this stupid mistake
because you were distracted.

1084
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:59,325
I can't even stand the sight of
you, so get out this instant.

1085
