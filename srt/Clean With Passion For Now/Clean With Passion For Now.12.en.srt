1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,067
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,135
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,135
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,168
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:37,133
-Go in. We're almost there.
-Give me...

8
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,001
Gosh, why is he so heavy?

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
That's real strong alcohol.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,400
Goodness.

11
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:44,942
Just go up this step, please.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,443
There, great.

13
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,664
You're doing well.

14
00:00:49,564 --> 00:00:51,131
Gosh.

15
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:30,930
I'm sorry...

16
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,130
...for not knowing how you felt.

17
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,997
I mean,

18
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,564
for pretending not to know.

19
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,831
If you're sorry,

20
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:15,598
I hope you start knowing
how I feel from now on.

21
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,398
The time!

22
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,631
It's already so late.

23
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,897
Good night.

24
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,564
What should I do?

25
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,878
Looking for me?

26
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,179
Don't run away.

27
00:03:41,145 --> 00:03:42,545
I left something in my room.

28
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:43,778
Your room?

29
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,479
I'm starving right now.

30
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,845
I'll go make breakfast.

31
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,779
Go make breakfast.

32
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:23,244
Enjoy.

33
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:25,878
Have a seat for a second.

34
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,330
Thanks for the food.

35
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,698
-About yesterday...
-You've fallen for me, right?

36
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,965
Pardon? I've...

37
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:11,365
-What did you say?
-So it's true.

38
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,063
You've fallen for me.

39
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,610
I think you got the wrong idea.

40
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:19,898
Be my girlfriend, Gil O Sol.

41
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:21,818
What?

42
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:22,933
Girlfriend?

43
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:27,631
Today is...

44
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:30,543
...our first day as a couple.

45
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,466
Our...

46
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:33,066
Our first day?

47
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,570
Why?

48
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:37,886
You don't want to?

49
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,330
No, it's not that.

50
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:43,896
I mean, that's not what I meant.

51
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:46,874
I've told you...

52
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:49,564
...that I don't have
any romantic feelings for you.

53
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,198
But it seems like you do.

54
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:53,754
No, I don't.

55
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,118
You do.

56
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:56,731
I don't.

57
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:08,098
Why are you being like this to me?

58
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:10,365
If you're joking,

59
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,532
please stop.

60
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,068
I'm not joking.

61
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:18,364
I'm dead serious.

62
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,765
Last night, didn't you say...

63
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,731
...you're sorry for pretending
not to know...

64
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:28,797
...about my feelings for you?

65
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,197
When did I say that?

66
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,299
You must've been...

67
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:42,931
...too drunk.

68
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,097
You caressed my face like this
as you were saying it.

69
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:08,665
I clearly remember.

70
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:18,831
Let's date.

71
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,063
For real.

72
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,545
I can't.

73
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:34,031
You can't?

74
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,565
No, I mean...

75
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,998
Let me know when you're done.
I'll clean up.

76
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:46,265
Wait, Ms. Gil. O Sol.

77
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,263
Ms. Gil.

78
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:06,730
Are you all right?

79
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:08,997
Yes.

80
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:18,665
Stop avoiding me and tell me.

81
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,565
It's not because of the doctor,
nor do you dislike me.

82
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:25,531
Why are you being like this?

83
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,031
Gosh, what do you mean?

84
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,155
At the moment...

85
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,431
...I'm not interested in dating anyone...

86
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,898
...whether it's you or someone else.

87
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:39,476
You're not interested in dating?
What do you mean by that?

88
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,198
You said the same thing to me a while ago.

89
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:44,643
-You said you had no interest.
-That was... Back then...

90
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,798
I feel the same way.

91
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,064
So I apologize for my reckless action...

92
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:51,364
...last night.

93
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,864
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:18,564
How much longer can I do this?

95
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:22,942
You shouldn't have moved
into that place to begin with.

96
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,464
What can you even do?

97
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:33,864
If it's too hard, just tell him the truth.

98
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,664
Who knows? He might be able to help you.

99
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,276
Tell him what?

100
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:43,009
"I promised your grandfather..."

101
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:45,418
"...that I'd never date you."

102
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:46,485
Are you talking about that?

103
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,009
Or shall I tell him that they promised...

104
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:53,264
...to help my brother
if I cured his mysophobia?

105
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:56,196
I can't say it.

106
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:57,780
I can't.

107
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,509
Me getting kicked out is one thing,
but what about O Dol?

108
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,976
Are you worried about O Dol?

109
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,998
Or are you afraid
that he might be disappointed?

110
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:10,631
Both.

111
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,498
Both?

112
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,322
I took on the job thinking
it'd be good for both of them,

113
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:20,664
but why do I feel like
everything's going astray now?

114
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:34,309
I already wiped that spot.

115
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,064
-Move. You filthy jerk.
-My gosh.

116
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:42,298
You even bought a key chain?
You have such a weird taste.

117
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:44,364
I...

118
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:47,397
...bought one too.

119
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,299
Let's go if we're done here.

120
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:53,964
Just a moment.

121
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:58,131
Is he seeing someone or what?

122
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,831
Something's fishy!

123
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:02,532
-Right? Something's up with him.
-Beluga.

124
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:12,831
Come here.

125
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,698
We cleaned all the glass panels
as well as the floors.

126
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,198
We're finishing up now.

127
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,930
Mr. Jang.

128
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,631
Mr. Jang?

129
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:34,996
Yes?

130
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,163
What are you pondering?

131
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,664
Me?

132
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:43,465
I wasn't. I wasn't
thinking about anything.

133
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:51,164
About Ms. Gil...

134
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:54,965
Have you heard anything?

135
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,998
What are you talking about?

136
00:11:58,664 --> 00:11:59,831
Well, you know.

137
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:03,698
Anything about her being
in a difficult situation?

138
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,065
I don't recall hearing anything like that.

139
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,932
Why? Did something happen to her?

140
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,857
Oh, no. It's not that.

141
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:19,343
Oh, right. You said your friend
in Minnesota was planning...

142
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:22,065
...to tell the girl how he feels
about her. Did it go well?

143
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,194
No.

144
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:26,346
I mean...

145
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:31,251
Well, he said...

146
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,764
...he's not sure whether
it went well or not.

147
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,631
Tell him that I'm rooting for him.

148
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,050
I have to go to that meeting now.

149
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,872
Okay, I'll see you at the office.

150
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:06,849
Yes.

151
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:09,075
Why did you reject Kim Hye Won?

152
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:13,065
How could you humiliate her twice?

153
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,438
Is that why you called?

154
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,497
Do you really like men?

155
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:22,809
Do you? Is that what it is?

156
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,571
Stop talking complete...

157
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:26,597
...nonsense.

158
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,098
I'm busy. I have to go.

159
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,564
Seon Gyeol.

160
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,364
Gosh, this brat.

161
00:13:47,664 --> 00:13:50,465
Feeling as if you're flying
freely in the sky...

162
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,331
...is certainly a privilege
only divers get to enjoy.

163
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,176
You can let everything go...

164
00:13:55,264 --> 00:13:57,176
...and solely focus on your breathing.

165
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:59,031
-O Sol.
-Yes?

166
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:01,464
That thing's on. Your favorite scene.

167
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:03,808
-Water. The water scene.
-There are...

168
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:05,398
...many similarities.

169
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:08,742
-Oh, it's really that scene.
-It helps them realize...

170
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,364
...that they are the center
of their lives.

171
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:14,031
My gosh, that is really cool.

172
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,426
How would it feel to be underwater?

173
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:18,855
It's so romantic.

174
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:21,309
When they do not know where to go,

175
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:24,842
they move forward by
listening to themselves.

176
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,330
It gives them a sense of freedom.

177
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,065
An envelope?

178
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,431
Yes.

179
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,631
Okay. I'll bring it to you right now.

180
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,098
Why did he forget something so important?

181
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:07,909
Are you done cleaning?

182
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:10,710
Yes, we're done here.
We just have to check Hall B.

183
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:13,865
I can do that.

184
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,565
You guys can leave now.

185
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:19,408
You all worked so hard.

186
00:15:19,497 --> 00:15:22,564
Get some good food on the way.
Beef, for example.

187
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,064
Well...

188
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,630
Thank you.

189
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,209
-No problem.
-Let's go.

190
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,464
Before he changes his mind.

191
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,197
Beluga.

192
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,412
Take care. I'll be back.

193
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,667
We'll meet again.

194
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,431
My goodness.

195
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,731
They must be lonely these days.

196
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,699
Mr. Jang, I'm here.

197
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,464
Where are you?

198
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:50,431
You're already here?

199
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:54,697
Come towards the main aquarium.

200
00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:58,656
Okay.

201
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:00,787
See you there.

202
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:19,064
There is no one else here.

203
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,931
You can take off
those sunglasses and mask.

204
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:25,931
Okay.

205
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,610
This is the envelope you
were talking about, right?

206
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,432
I hope I didn't make any mistake.

207
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,731
Don't worry. This is nothing important.

208
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:40,333
Pardon?

209
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,465
What I needed was...

210
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:45,897
...you.

211
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:51,797
You wanted to be underwater.

212
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:56,564
I thought this might be the closest thing.

213
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:08,365
If you don't need anything else,
I'll get going.

214
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,464
Why? Stay with me just for an hour.

215
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,464
Just for an hour.

216
00:17:19,464 --> 00:17:20,531
Well...

217
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:21,864
Come.

218
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:24,164
Where are we going?

219
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,764
The Beluga will be fine.

220
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,909
It sang to me with a beautiful voice.

221
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:33,509
Have you ever tried whale meat?

222
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,209
I know a famous restaurant.

223
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,998
You barbarian. You eat all you want.

224
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:44,397
My Beluga.

225
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,676
Have you seen my phone strap?

226
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,031
You lost it?

227
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,433
Good. It was so tacky.

228
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,234
I have to go back in.

229
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,897
Hey! You can't go in there alone.

230
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:13,643
Is that documentary fun?

231
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,498
You recommended it...

232
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,464
...to that quack.

233
00:18:21,897 --> 00:18:23,030
It's not...

234
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,132
...exactly fun.

235
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:26,797
But it's cool.

236
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:31,130
There is a scene where they free-dive.

237
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,097
It amazes me every time I watch it.

238
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,930
Free-diving?

239
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:43,331
For a while, I seriously considered...

240
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,831
...learning how to do it.

241
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,931
Did you learn how to do it?

242
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:49,564
No.

243
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,164
You can't do everything
you want to do in life.

244
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,497
Sometimes, you're forced to do
something you don't want to do.

245
00:19:00,064 --> 00:19:01,097
Sometimes...

246
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:09,597
You have to give up on something you want.

247
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,397
Is that a turtle?

248
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:35,664
I saw...

249
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:38,168
...this TV documentary once.

250
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:41,764
When sea turtles hatch,

251
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,964
they follow the stars
to go back to the sea.

252
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:49,632
On their way, most of them
fall prey to predators.

253
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:52,464
Only three percent make it...

254
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:54,232
...to the sea.

255
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,633
That's...

256
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,800
...a law of nature.

257
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,367
But...

258
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,834
...nowadays...

259
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,968
...baby sea turtles...

260
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,700
...are lured by artificial lights
on beaches.

261
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,368
They head to the city, not the sea.

262
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,001
In the end, they dry out.

263
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,135
Do you...

264
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,568
...ever wonder that?

265
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,535
"Am I..."

266
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:41,835
"...being guided by the stars..."

267
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:44,968
"...or..."

268
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,967
"...artificial lights?"

269
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,802
"If I am being guided
by artificial lights,"

270
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,201
"will I ever make it back to the sea?"

271
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,779
I swear I dropped it around here.

272
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,112
Nothing is here.

273
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,279
Let's just go.

274
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,168
No. It has to be around here.

275
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
Where is my Beluga?

276
00:21:11,968 --> 00:21:13,368
Gosh, this is a waste of time.

277
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,469
I can't believe you.

278
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,268
What are you staring at?

279
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,367
Me?

280
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:24,045
Isn't that O Sol?

281
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,166
I found it.

282
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,800
What should we do?

283
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,268
I saw O Sol.

284
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:33,312
What would she be doing here at this hour?

285
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,813
You're being ridiculous.

286
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,379
I'm sure you're mistaken.

287
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:38,279
-Let's go.
-I swear.

288
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:39,868
I can't be mistaken.

289
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,400
Hold on.

290
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,846
You heard something?

291
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:47,980
Right?

292
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,980
I'm not sure. Let's just go.

293
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:52,268
Listen. I definitely hear something.

294
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,346
You don't hear that?

295
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:56,246
I think I hear something too.

296
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:57,568
Who are you?

297
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,513
What are you doing here?

298
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:02,801
We're from a cleaning agency.

299
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,045
We're just finishing up.

300
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:06,212
If you're done, please leave.

301
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,834
Okay. Sorry.

302
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,067
Let's go.

303
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:10,634
Come on.

304
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,079
It was definitely O Sol.

305
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,200
Stop it.

306
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,446
I'm sorry. I was nervous.

307
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:38,534
Well...

308
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:43,012
Why did you hide? You could have
told them you were working.

309
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,001
That would have been fine for me...

310
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,913
...but you haven't told them...

311
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,602
...that you're working at my place.

312
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:59,234
I think it's been about an hour.

313
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:01,467
Shall we go?

314
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,101
It's already...

315
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,468
...been an hour?

316
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:09,400
All right.

317
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,367
Let's go.

318
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,266
Get up.

319
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,301
It's just like being underwater.

320
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,201
It's beautiful.

321
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,468
Whether they are stars or lights,

322
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,267
can't you go with me?

323
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,533
If we look for it together...

324
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,801
...we might be able to...

325
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,468
...make it to the sea more easily.

326
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:37,101
If that's not the case,

327
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:44,335
I'll just take you there.

328
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:54,901
Trust me.

329
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,834
If it's with you,

330
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,001
I feel like I can go anywhere.

331
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,312
-No, that's not true.
-You borrowed my money last time.

332
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,834
Don't you remember?

333
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,468
-O Sol!
-What's up?

334
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:19,880
-What's up?
-It's so good to see you.

335
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,079
Our food just came out.

336
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,501
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

337
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,001
-You're dating, aren't you?
-Who?

338
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,101
Me? Date?

339
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:33,367
You can fool everyone else,
but you can't fool me.

340
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,145
Who is he?

341
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,834
Does he work at the aquarium?

342
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,734
Don't be ridiculous.

343
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:46,235
Look at your makeup and your lipstick.

344
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,434
You even washed your hair.

345
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:51,101
Tell me. Who is the guy
that made you like this?

346
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:53,468
Aren't you going to introduce us?

347
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,300
Why do you keep thinking that I'm dating?

348
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,934
My gosh.

349
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,301
I feel really happy for you.

350
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,667
Everyone around me is dating.
It's like it's dating season.

351
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:07,533
Why? Who else is dating?

352
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:08,834
Him.

353
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,201
-Really?
-He speaks so politely to her.

354
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,346
"Yes, I have time."

355
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,801
"Yes, I'm on my way."

356
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,902
Despite his cold looks,
he's so obedient to his girlfriend.

357
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:21,779
Look.

358
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:23,379
-Hey, don't.
-Come on.

359
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:24,701
No!

360
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,667
Hello? This is Lee Dong Hyeon's phone.

361
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,467
A guardian?

362
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,734
Your grandma is in critical condition.

363
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:51,990
Mr. Jang?

364
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,856
How did you come here?

365
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,235
Your grandmother is in the operating room.

366
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:58,679
She'll be out soon.

367
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,167
I can't thank you enough.

368
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,534
Who is Kang Deok Soon's guardian?

369
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,867
O Sol was with us.

370
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,734
It's been a while
since you've seen her, right?

371
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,500
Yes.

372
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:55,567
Unbelievable.

373
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,300
So the elder lady in here...

374
00:28:58,634 --> 00:29:00,612
...is not Dong Hyeon's grandma...

375
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:03,579
...but the grandma of a friend
who died from an assault case?

376
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,101
-Yes.
-Furthermore,

377
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:09,199
he was falsely accused
for that assault case?

378
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,801
It's apparently a famous
story among the nurses here.

379
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,533
Dong Hyeon.

380
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,934
-Dong Hyeon.
-Dong Hyeon.

381
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,167
Here's my credit card.

382
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:32,504
Thank you.

383
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:36,434
Mr. Jang paid for the hospital bills
all this time.

384
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,034
After I was released, I tried almost
everything you could think of.

385
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:43,268
It wasn't easy for me...

386
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,700
...to find a proper job
when I had a history of assault.

387
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,301
I did anything I could...

388
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:51,802
...and began to work
at a cleaning service company.

389
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:54,335
That's when I met Mr. Jang.

390
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:57,668
He heard my story and
still offered me a job.

391
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,402
Since then and until this day,

392
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,701
he treated me without any bias. And...

393
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,835
...he was the first person
who stood by my side.

394
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:13,667
Mr. Jang is like a savior to me.

395
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,134
Are you going home?

396
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:57,457
Get in.

397
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,667
Why are you looking at me like that?

398
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:14,640
What?

399
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,646
I thought you had already left.

400
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,283
I had something to take care of,

401
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,202
and didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

402
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:31,168
What about Dong Hyeon?

403
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,826
He's still at the hospital.

404
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,600
I heard the elder lady is okay.

405
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:40,468
The surgery went well.

406
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,701
I'm relieved.

407
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,243
You must've been surprised
to see me suddenly.

408
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:55,201
Well, a little.

409
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,985
I heard everything from Dong Hyeon.

410
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,402
That you helped him support
that lady all this time.

411
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,227
I wasn't the one who helped.

412
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,467
It's Dong Hyeon.

413
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:22,674
You look pretty with makeup on.

414
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:25,110
Sorry?

415
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,279
You look even prettier without it.

416
00:32:43,534 --> 00:32:44,634
You're home.

417
00:32:45,979 --> 00:32:46,964
Ms. Cha.

418
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,613
What brings you here so late?

419
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,801
Why are you so surprised?

420
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,801
Why are you two coming home together?

421
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:55,901
Why did you barge in here
again without even calling?

422
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:00,800
What is that?

423
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:03,669
Oh, come take a look.

424
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:11,068
I asked around and received pictures
of the finest ladies around here.

425
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,479
Why do you keep doing this?
I said I'm not interested.

426
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:17,729
Why aren't you interested?

427
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:19,301
You said you like women.

428
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:22,701
But that...

429
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:26,571
Look. I'll let you meet anyone
as long as you like her.

430
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,875
Please, can't you just stop?

431
00:33:30,901 --> 00:33:33,145
Is there a woman you like?

432
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,982
Is that why?

433
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:41,281
Yes there is.

434
00:33:41,842 --> 00:33:42,918
I like someone.

435
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:45,524
What? There is?

436
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,134
Oh my gosh.

437
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,969
Who is it? Who?

438
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,980
Hold on. Get me some juice
with a lot of ice in it.

439
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,068
Okay.

440
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:04,368
She is the woman I like.

441
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:12,068
So I hope you stop doing
things like this from now on.

442
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,402
What's he saying? What?

443
00:34:16,068 --> 00:34:17,669
What's he talking about now?

444
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:22,045
Nothing. It's nothing,

445
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:23,634
so please don't worry about it.

446
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,274
The lady I like...

447
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,268
...is Ms. Gil O Sol right here.

448
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,168
Wait, hang on.

449
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:44,034
What's going on? So you're saying...

450
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,234
...this girl is the one you like?

451
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,312
This girl, O Sol?

452
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,749
-Yes.
-No.

453
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,938
Ma'am.

454
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:54,847
That is not true.

455
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:58,012
You said you didn't decide to move in
because you like Seon Gyeol.

456
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,667
You said you came here to work.

457
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,546
Yes, I did move in here to work.

458
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,179
What kind of work? Answer me.

459
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,346
Seducing him?

460
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:06,310
Mom.

461
00:35:07,993 --> 00:35:10,093
Answer me. Since when?

462
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:11,779
Since when?

463
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:12,867
Well...

464
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,834
It's just...

465
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,268
Mr. Jang just...

466
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,801
...has a crush on me.

467
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,212
Goodness.

468
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,079
What? That is absurd.

469
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,079
Hey, why would Seon Gyeol
have a crush on you?

470
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,016
She's right.

471
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:33,101
It's a one-sided thing.

472
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,834
For now, at least.

473
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:40,634
So...

474
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,001
...she doesn't like you.

475
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,400
It's the other way around?

476
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:50,634
Why?

477
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:13,135
Why did you want
to see me out of the blue?

478
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:14,868
You see...

479
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:16,300
...no matter...

480
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,667
...how hard I try...

481
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,880
...to understand the situation...

482
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:25,435
...I just cannot understand
what is going on.

483
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:28,834
Why don't you like my son, Seon Gyeol?

484
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,122
Pardon?

485
00:36:32,001 --> 00:36:35,802
I mean, is it even
possible not to like him?

486
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,312
He's handsome, rich, and successful.

487
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,533
He's the perfect catch, and
yet he has a crush on you.

488
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,934
Gosh, I can't believe it.

489
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:48,300
Is it because of his personality?

490
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,601
-Sorry?
-Right.

491
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,602
He is my son, but he can be...

492
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:57,701
...cantankerous at times. I admit it.

493
00:36:57,901 --> 00:37:01,101
No, he's not cantankerous at all.

494
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,513
He's a wonderful person
once you get to know him.

495
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,335
You know him very well.

496
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:06,524
Then what is it?

497
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:08,526
Is it...

498
00:37:09,068 --> 00:37:10,702
...because of his mysophobia?

499
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,045
Do you think it's too much?

500
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,546
No, it's not that.

501
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:16,335
I guess you're still clueless
because you're young.

502
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,834
Do you know how great it is
to date guys who are clean?

503
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:21,412
Guys who are fussy but clean...

504
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,167
...are much better than...

505
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:24,813
...men who never shower and stink.

506
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:26,602
It's so much better.

507
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,054
Absolutely.

508
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,434
At the moment, I can't even afford...

509
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,335
...to judge whether
someone is clean or not.

510
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:38,011
What's the problem, then?

511
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,133
What don't you like about Seon Gyeol?

512
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,279
Well, it's not that I dislike him.

513
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:46,168
I mean...

514
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:49,769
Shall I say it's because of...

515
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,667
...the difference between
our social statuses?

516
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:55,101
He's way out of my league.

517
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,679
I'm speechless. This is ridiculous.

518
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:01,201
You're young. Why must you think that way?

519
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,380
Pardon me?

520
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:05,112
To be honest with you,
I thought you were quite impudent...

521
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,468
...and outspoken. I liked that about you.

522
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,535
I'm not.

523
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,159
I'm very polite,

524
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:17,234
and I hold my tongue all the time.

525
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:22,768
I have no idea why Seon Gyeol likes you.

526
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:26,501
I know, right?

527
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,741
Why does he like me?

528
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:31,943
It's causing trouble for both of us.

529
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,007
By any chance...

530
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:42,620
Did my father say something to you?

531
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,045
-Sorry?
-Did he tell you not to date him?

532
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,656
Did he say there will be consequences?

533
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,214
Dad, we need to talk.

534
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,979
How dare you barge into my office?

535
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:12,984
When will you grow up?

536
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,079
You'll turn 50 soon.

537
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,822
Yes, I will turn 50 soon,
so I must say my piece.

538
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,867
Do not meddle...

539
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,633
...in Seon Gyeol's love life.

540
00:39:22,034 --> 00:39:24,002
Don't do what?

541
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:26,880
I don't want him to live
a miserable life like I did.

542
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,880
He's miserable enough as it is.

543
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,012
You know that.

544
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,611
What are you talking about?

545
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:34,713
Seon Gyeol is seeing someone now?

546
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:35,857
O Sol.

547
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,142
He likes her.

548
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,147
When I was pregnant with Seon Gyeol,

549
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:44,515
you separated me from his dad.

550
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,976
Don't you dare split up those two.

551
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,020
If you do, I won't let it slide.

552
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,134
Promise me, Dad.

553
00:39:54,867 --> 00:39:57,401
If O Sol cures his mysophobia,

554
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:00,135
you'll just let them be.

555
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:01,771
Okay?

556
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:03,842
Stop spewing nonsense and leave.

557
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:04,964
Now!

558
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:07,168
Dad, please.

559
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,279
Dr. Kim, what brings you here?

560
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,901
Oh, I'm here to see Chairman Cha.

561
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:29,301
He's in his office, right?

562
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,734
-Yes.
-Great.

563
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:33,609
Wait, Dr. Kim.

564
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:46,569
So you're saying the shock therapy...

565
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:49,846
...can produce visible results, right?

566
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:51,268
Yes.

567
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:54,145
But you need enough safety
measures in place...

568
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:55,533
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

569
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:02,067
For the fourth quarter...

570
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,301
I have to take this call.

571
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,001
Sure.

572
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:16,834
Please go on.

573
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:21,302
We conducted a survey among
our customers from the fourth quarter.

574
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,500
Yes, sir.

575
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:28,275
Gil O Sol?

576
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:30,279
I'd like you to find out...

577
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:33,901
...as much information
as you can about her.

578
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,816
Yes, anything you can find.

579
00:41:36,224 --> 00:41:39,396
Anything and everything about her.

580
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,534
Sure. No problem, sir.

581
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,801
O Sol, I need you...

582
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:55,868
...to go home today.

583
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:56,982
Pardon me?

584
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:58,686
Go home?

585
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,334
Leave immediately.

586
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,001
And stay at home until I call you.

587
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:07,546
If Seon Gyeol calls you,
don't answer it. Got it?

588
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:08,880
But why all of a sudden...

589
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,813
I'll explain everything later.

590
00:42:10,901 --> 00:42:13,412
For now, just do as I say. Okay?

591
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,667
Talk to you later.

592
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:16,735
Wait, hello?

593
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:17,891
Ma'am.

594
00:42:18,229 --> 00:42:19,262
Hello?

595
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,145
Sir, it's not hard to do.

596
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,836
-Please check it just once.
-Gosh.

597
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,202
For goodness' sake.

598
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:35,844
Sir.

599
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,907
Check it for me just once.

600
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,246
Why is it, that only
that part is missing...

601
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:41,980
...among all the security camera footage?

602
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:44,800
Gosh, this young lady is so stubborn.

603
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:46,327
We don't have it because it doesn't exist!

604
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,022
You'll never find it even if
you keep coming, so leave!

605
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,499
Goodness gracious.

606
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:55,768
You're all colluding together, right?

607
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:57,989
You're helping those hoodlums, aren't you?

608
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:01,746
Those hoodlums' hit him first.
Why is only that footage missing?

609
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:03,419
Darn it.

610
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,451
It hurts.

611
00:43:14,265 --> 00:43:15,265
Hey, O Dol.

612
00:43:16,205 --> 00:43:17,472
O Dol. It's not like that.

613
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:19,996
I just fell on my own.

614
00:43:20,138 --> 00:43:22,133
You're lying. I saw everything.

615
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:23,935
Move.

616
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,237
I said, move.

617
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,605
Hey!

618
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:31,538
What? Are you going to
beat him up or something?

619
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,004
You really want to quit sports?

620
00:43:34,104 --> 00:43:35,404
Yes, I don't care.

621
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:39,383
Why would you beg
for security camera footage?

622
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:42,315
Why do you keep butting in?

623
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:48,206
I feel responsible.

624
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,938
If something happens to you,
how will I face O Sol?

625
00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:55,338
-How will I face your dad?
-It's not your fault.

626
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:57,606
I'm the one who hit that person.

627
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:01,605
So why did you? Why?

628
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:04,199
I heard a disciplinary
committee will be held.

629
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:06,039
What are you going to do now?

630
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:08,513
What's on your mind?

631
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:17,271
Stop crying.

632
00:44:18,971 --> 00:44:20,538
Stop crying.

633
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:26,964
Stop crying.

634
00:44:37,391 --> 00:44:38,558
Are you done crying now?

635
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:41,087
This is embarrassing.

636
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:46,651
I'm hungry.

637
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,656
Let's go.

638
00:44:58,576 --> 00:44:59,493
Here.

639
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:00,693
What?

640
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:03,753
Your skirt is way too short.

641
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:04,836
Cover yourself.

642
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:07,920
This kind of skirt is
supposed to be short.

643
00:45:18,587 --> 00:45:19,954
It must be uncomfortable to walk in.

644
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:27,388
Come. I'm starving.

645
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:32,430
Wait for me.

646
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,321
It's so cold.

647
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:37,787
Japchae?

648
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:39,412
Is it a special day today?

649
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:40,779
Oh, my.

650
00:45:41,878 --> 00:45:42,750
Here.

651
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,242
Try.

652
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:48,445
How does it taste?

653
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:50,646
Good.

654
00:45:51,078 --> 00:45:52,583
O Sol is on vacation.

655
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:55,702
She only told me today.

656
00:45:56,935 --> 00:45:57,822
Vacation?

657
00:45:58,788 --> 00:46:00,658
Dad, I'm home.

658
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:03,503
Oh, my girl is here.

659
00:46:04,902 --> 00:46:07,803
My girl.

660
00:46:09,735 --> 00:46:11,213
How did you get here so fast?

661
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,434
You didn't have to bring anything.

662
00:46:13,535 --> 00:46:16,635
KTX is really fast.

663
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:18,301
This is nothing.

664
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,178
Have you been doing well?

665
00:46:22,173 --> 00:46:24,802
Yes. O Sol, it's been a while.

666
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:28,002
-You look a bit tanned.
-I do?

667
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:30,613
-I live near the sea.
-Right.

668
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:31,981
Where is O Dol?

669
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:33,336
He will be home soon.

670
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:35,135
You didn't eat, did you?

671
00:46:35,268 --> 00:46:37,435
Have a seat. The food will be ready soon.

672
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,269
Take your time.

673
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,102
You're on vacation?

674
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,501
Kind of.

675
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,368
(Job Application)

676
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,769
(Cover Letter)

677
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:06,803
(My life turned upside down
when my mother passed away)

678
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:17,341
The quotation request has been
confirmed and sent to you.

679
00:47:17,772 --> 00:47:19,379
Okay. I'll take a look.

680
00:47:19,468 --> 00:47:22,735
Ye Joon must be waiting for you.
Shouldn't you head home?

681
00:47:23,301 --> 00:47:25,835
Yes. I'll leave after checking the e-mail.

682
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,303
Thank you for today.

683
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,570
I'm on my way home.

684
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,647
Is there anything you want to eat?

685
00:48:12,902 --> 00:48:15,747
So when will the Busan branch open?

686
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:16,694
What?

687
00:48:17,482 --> 00:48:19,370
Oh, next week.

688
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:22,514
When it's open, I'll be pretty busy.

689
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:24,103
That's why I took a vacation now.

690
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:25,547
That was a good idea.

691
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:28,881
By the way, why is everything
that you bought from China?

692
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:31,314
You can get it even here.

693
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:34,435
Well, the thing is, things from Korea...

694
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:37,403
...are expensive in Busan too.

695
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:41,570
Right. It's hard to get fish
from Korea even near the sea.

696
00:48:44,226 --> 00:48:45,626
I guess that's right.

697
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:51,171
How is it going with
the disciplinary committee...

698
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,560
...for O Dol?

699
00:48:57,197 --> 00:48:58,935
Don't worry too much.

700
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:02,144
His coaches and colleagues
are helping him a lot.

701
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:03,400
It'll be fine.

702
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:07,438
My son, cheer up and eat.

703
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:08,846
All right.

704
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:19,166
How is it going?

705
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:33,401
Ms. Cha.

706
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,574
Everything is going as planned.

707
00:49:36,663 --> 00:49:38,776
This will be a perfect shock therapy.

708
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:41,181
10 out of 10!

709
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:44,368
Yes!

710
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:53,815
Dr. Kim.

711
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:58,733
Is the medical team waiting outside?

712
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:01,903
Okay. Let's do this.

713
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:38,508
Ms. Gil?

714
00:50:58,061 --> 00:50:59,367
Ms. Gil...

715
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:07,336
What is going on here?

716
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,069
Come.

717
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,378
(Mr. Jang)

718
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:32,437
(Missed call from Mr. Jang)

719
00:53:10,214 --> 00:53:11,247
O Sol.

720
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,153
Why isn't she answering?

721
00:53:15,336 --> 00:53:16,770
O Sol, answer the phone.

722
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,365
(Mr. Jang)

723
00:53:30,199 --> 00:53:32,647
Go get some rest. I'll finish up here.

724
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:34,758
No, I'll do it. I'm almost done.

725
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,863
Then shall we do it together?

726
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:44,203
Aren't you going to answer that?

727
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:46,857
What?

728
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:48,803
It has been ringing for a while.

729
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,035
O Sol...

730
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,502
Gil...

731
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:01,870
O Sol...

732
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:05,585
O Sol...

733
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,136
O Sol...

734
00:54:13,102 --> 00:54:14,148
O Sol...

735
00:54:14,236 --> 00:54:16,620
(Mr. Jang)

736
00:54:18,872 --> 00:54:19,972
Is...

737
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:22,338
...something wrong?

738
00:54:23,565 --> 00:54:25,132
No, nothing is wrong.

739
00:54:27,272 --> 00:54:29,672
Then leave this up to me,

740
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,107
and go talk to him.

741
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:33,356
It seems he's pretty desperate.

742
00:54:37,138 --> 00:54:38,305
Okay, then.

743
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:49,698
Hello?

744
00:54:51,673 --> 00:54:52,689
Mr. Jang?

745
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:54,073
O Sol...

746
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:55,540
Hello?

747
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:58,459
O Sol.

748
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,073
Mr. Jang?

749
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,240
Do you hear my voice?

750
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,084
O Sol...

751
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:05,873
-O Sol...
-Is something wrong?

752
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:07,506
Mr. Jang?

753
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:09,940
Mr. Jang!

754
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:22,051
What on earth is so urgent...

755
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:23,618
...that you have to go out this late?

756
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,773
I'm sorry, Dad. Something
came up at the company.

757
00:55:25,862 --> 00:55:27,196
I'm sorry, O Dol.

758
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:28,806
I'll call you later!

759
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:47,578
I'll go with you.

760
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:55,474
Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!

761
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:07,406
Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!

762
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:11,539
Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!

763
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:13,040
Mr. Jang!

764
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:18,172
Get out!

765
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,207
I said, get out! Get out!

766
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:23,073
Get out!

767
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:37,828
Everyone, out.

768
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,274
Get out!

769
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:42,366
Don't you hear me?

770
00:56:43,473 --> 00:56:44,740
Mr. Jang.

771
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:51,108
Mr. Jang!

772
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:52,373
Oh, gosh.

773
00:56:52,903 --> 00:56:53,740
What happened?

774
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:58,218
Mr. Jang, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

775
00:56:58,306 --> 00:57:00,007
You have to regain your senses.

776
00:57:00,206 --> 00:57:02,339
Mr. Jang! Mr. Jang!

777
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:03,539
Mr. Jang...

778
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:06,672
Mr. Jang!

779
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,669
O Sol.

780
00:57:16,073 --> 00:57:17,140
Gil...

781
00:57:18,172 --> 00:57:19,239
...O Sol.

782
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:21,406
Are you okay?

783
00:57:55,108 --> 00:57:56,442
He will be fine now.

784
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:58,573
Don't worry too much.

785
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,973
Did you look into what I asked?

786
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,372
An accidental death?

787
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:28,739
When?

788
00:58:32,073 --> 00:58:33,744
The Jungang-dong incident?

789
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,606
Are you saying Ms. Gil's mother...

790
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,274
...was one of the victims
of the AG Group incident?

791
00:58:44,373 --> 00:58:45,740
I understand.

792
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:56,872
(Applicant Form,
Gil O Sol)

793
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,924
You must've been so scared,
suffering on your own.

794
00:59:23,715 --> 00:59:25,282
I didn't even know that.

795
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:52,706
I'm sorry...

796
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:56,540
...for coming too late.

797
01:02:16,339 --> 01:02:18,273
Mr. Jang, Mr. Jang!

798
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:21,339
Gil O Sol.

799
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:26,974
O Sol.

800
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:28,991
O Sol!

801
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:32,007
Mr. Jang, you're awake.

802
01:02:32,473 --> 01:02:34,551
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

803
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:48,539
I was so worried about you.

804
01:02:49,793 --> 01:02:51,394
I thought something bad might've happened,

805
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,507
and I was terrified.

806
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,306
Mr. Jang.

807
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,107
From now on,

808
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:11,207
don't go anywhere without me.

809
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:16,171
You have to stay...

810
01:03:17,473 --> 01:03:18,873
...right next to me 24 hours a day.

811
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,107
Okay, O Sol?

812
01:03:35,007 --> 01:03:36,140
I will.

813
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,111
I won't go anywhere.

814
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:48,340
Let's be together 24 hours a day.

815
01:04:40,873 --> 01:04:42,040
Don't go anywhere.

816
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:46,907
You promised me.

817
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:54,109
I won't go anywhere.

818
01:04:57,506 --> 01:04:58,773
I'll stay right by your side.

819
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:57,506
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

820
01:05:57,606 --> 01:05:59,919
I can go by myself.

821
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:03,441
Yes, Mr. Gil. Please allow
me to date your daughter.

822
01:06:03,706 --> 01:06:06,507
Isn't he so good-looking?
He's my boyfriend.

823
01:06:06,706 --> 01:06:09,940
I really shouldn't be doing this
for O Dol's sake.

824
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:12,040
A disciplinary hearing
for O Sol's brother?

825
01:06:12,439 --> 01:06:14,706
Your brother will be fine.

826
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:18,574
I plan to pass AG Group
down to Seon Gyeol.

827
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,819
They're certainly
not right for each other.

828
01:06:20,907 --> 01:06:24,644
Find suitable people
to put in the disciplinary committee.

829
