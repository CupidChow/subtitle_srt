1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:01,167
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,567
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:12,134
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,101
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,567 --> 00:00:22,134
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,002
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,184
(Junior Track and Field Competition)

8
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:47,247
Until my first year in high school,
I was a track and field athlete.

9
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:48,601
Ready!

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,867
Keep going! Good!

11
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,045
Good!

12
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:01,612
My specialty was hurdling.

13
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,212
It's also known as obstacle racing.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
Keep running!

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,467
O Sol, good! You can do it!

16
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,834
A little more. Keep running!

17
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:11,701
Yes! You're almost there!

18
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,679
O Sol came in first place!

19
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:14,767
First place!

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,334
Gold medalist of hurdling, Gil O Sol.

21
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:22,312
My dad always told me life was
just like obstacle racing.

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,768
Gil O Sol!

23
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:26,691
-The rules of life are so harsh
-Dad!

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,502
that once you pass through an obstacle,

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,924
another one always awaits you.

26
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,919
So he told me never to get exhausted,

27
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:37,416
and overcome anything, just like
jumping over those hurdles.

28
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:41,908
Back then, I didn't know
what life was about...

29
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:44,631
...or what he exactly meant by that.

30
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,891
I guess those harsh rules of life...

31
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:51,224
...are just like this ice cream
bar that split in two ways...

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,091
...in a way I never expected.

33
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:56,756
No matter how hard I try,
things don't go the way I want,

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,357
and life goes on
regardless of my own will.

35
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:01,857
It's like an invisible force
is controlling my life.

36
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,423
Let's go.

37
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,390
Hurdling is about jumping
over an obstacle...

38
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:31,044
...that's 76.2cm high and 120cm wide.

39
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,557
The two most important things you
need in order to win this match...

40
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,558
-...are power and speed.
-Ready.

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,869
Also, you have to estimate
the appropriate timing...

42
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,325
...to jump over the obstacles
in front of you.

43
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,224
Shoot.

44
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,223
Wait for me.

45
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:26,969
My knee.

46
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:33,623
What is this?

47
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,891
Your bad taste for men eventually
made you into a total fool.

48
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,824
"Am I your girlfriend now?"

49
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,691
Does that still work?

50
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,556
How embarrassing.

51
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:28,523
Excuse me. No, that's not true!

52
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,056
That's not true!

53
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,825
I said that's not true!

54
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:36,879
I told you, that's not true.

55
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:39,457
That's not true!

56
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:54,291
My goodness.

57
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,791
How much did you drink last night?

58
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,750
Watch out, this soup is hot.

59
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,417
Why? Is something wrong?

60
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,917
Nothing's wrong at all.

61
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,716
This dried pollack soup
will help with your hangover.

62
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:25,315
What's wrong?

63
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:28,150
No! O Dol is taking a dump
in the bathroom right now!

64
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,950
Sorry. I didn't see anything.

65
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,616
Hold on.

66
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,385
Hey, Gil O Dol!

67
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,316
Get your butt over here.

68
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:45,461
-Come out.
-I didn't smoke it.

69
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:48,194
I just found Dad's
cigarette, and got curious.

70
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,595
I was really just looking at it.

71
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,261
-Take it off right now.
-What?

72
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,916
Pull your pants down on the
count of three. 1, 2, 3!

73
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:57,316
What on earth?

74
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,486
Why are you wearing this?

75
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:00,598
Wait...

76
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,461
-Then that box...
-O Sol, just listen to me.

77
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:07,161
Why are you wearing this!

78
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:08,695
-Stop that!
-Tell me why!

79
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,517
Why aren't you two eating breakfast?

80
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:13,416
What is that in your hand?

81
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,950
-It's the one I bought.
-No.

82
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,951
You little punk.

83
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,128
-Come here, you punk.
-It's all a misunderstanding!

84
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,316
I'm telling you!

85
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:21,184
Take off that underwear right now!

86
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,650
Come over here!

87
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,508
The weather is wonderful.

88
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:33,983
There's barely any fine dust
and the sky is so clear.

89
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,094
-Stop, you jerk!
-Get over here.

90
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,783
You better stop right now.

91
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:47,015
You little punk!

92
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,682
Come here.

93
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,728
Get over here. Take that off right now!

94
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:54,105
-O Sol, let me explain.
-You little punk.

95
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,328
You're still a little kid.

96
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,461
How could you smoke
when your dad is at home?

97
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,564
Dad, I really didn't smoke it.
I'm telling you.

98
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,927
I never smoke anyone's last cigarette.

99
00:07:02,015 --> 00:07:03,048
Last cigarette?

100
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,662
Give me back my underwear!

101
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,128
Today is the last day you breathe.

102
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,827
-Dad, hold on.
-Come here.

103
00:07:07,915 --> 00:07:10,128
-Please, stop.
-Let me take his underwear first.

104
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:11,817
-Take it off now.
-I'm sorry, Dad.

105
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,228
Come over here, you jerk!

106
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,184
I said, take off that underwear!

107
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,228
What is this?

108
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,794
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

109
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:19,349
Stop, you little punk!

110
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,883
Take off your underwear right now!

111
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:24,929
-Take it off!
-You guys...

112
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:28,077
...really seem like a happy
and harmonious family.

113
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:30,982
Good morning!

114
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,488
(Cleaning Fairy)

115
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,549
I e-mailed you the list of
cleaning tools and supplies.

116
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:48,105
Please confirm before noon.

117
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,384
In the afternoon, you have
to meet the investors...

118
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,150
A fingerprint here. Clean this part again.

119
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:55,016
And you'll have to do a presentation.

120
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:56,749
I sent you the details via e-mail.

121
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,662
I see soap scum in the sink.

122
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,028
-Clean it again.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:01,450
Another fingerprint here. Clean again.

124
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:04,550
-Clean behind the photocopier too.
-Yes, sir.

125
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,984
Organize the binders again.

126
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:16,790
-Jae Min.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:18,916
-Clean the toaster again.
-Got it.

128
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:26,561
-Dong Hyeon.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,216
-Reorganize the cushions.
-Yes, sir.

130
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,302
All Cleaning Fairies.

131
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,294
Clean the whole office again!

132
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:00,550
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

133
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,244
I'll send you a report regarding
recruitment in the first half.

134
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,595
Please review it and let me know.

135
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,683
About the open recruitment,
we'll do what we've always done.

136
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:14,561
I'll leave it in your hands.

137
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,716
Got it, sir.

138
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,927
Extra hand sanitizers and gloves...

139
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,782
...are in your desk drawer...

140
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:32,683
...and I left a change
of clothes at the usual spot.

141
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,794
-Okay, enough.
-If you need anything else,

142
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:35,994
please let me know anytime.

143
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,583
I will. Thank you.

144
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,558
(Horse Head)

145
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,774
You see, what happened was...

146
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,600
Gosh, you must've been surprised.

147
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:34,456
I left my brother's birthday
gift in that bag. My goodness.

148
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:37,470
You didn't open the box, did you?

149
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,764
Touching someone else's belonging
can be considered theft...

150
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,599
Hello, you're here.

151
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,243
Sorry to keep bothering you.
I know you're busy.

152
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:04,199
Gosh, why did I leave this in that bag?

153
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,598
Right?

154
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,597
-You didn't open this box, right?
-Well...

155
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:12,045
You should work on refining your taste.

156
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:15,632
You probably got dumped because
of your horrendous taste.

157
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,693
What did you just say? Gosh...

158
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:20,950
Who told you that you could open the box?

159
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,800
You're ridiculous.

160
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,163
Gosh, what is this?

161
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:30,564
So? When will you reimburse
me for the repair cost?

162
00:11:31,364 --> 00:11:32,564
Well, that's...

163
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:37,376
I told you that I'll reimburse
you by the end of the month.

164
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,831
I already asked for your understanding.

Do I have to be understanding
just because you asked?

166
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,798
No, it's not that, but...

167
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:50,032
You don't seem to be struggling
financially, so don't be petty.

168
00:11:50,264 --> 00:11:53,443
If you can give me a little
more time to help me out...

169
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,132
I am not a philanthropist.

170
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,143
I'm only here because you
found my robot vacuum,

171
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,032
so let's not bother each other anymore.

by the end of this week,

174
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:09,490
my lawyer will be in touch
to take legal action.

175
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:12,372
What? Legal action?
Does that mean you'll sue me?

176
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:15,264
How could you sue someone
over something like this?

177
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:16,728
Wait, sir.

178

Gosh, what's happening?
Was that deja vu or a prophetic dream?

184
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:41,598
I wondered what that nightmare was about.

185

What? What now? What is it this time?

186

189
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,098
Did you get a new car?

190

I don't think this is
the car I saw last time.

192
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,859
Hey, what do you want?

193
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:15,038
I thought we were done.
Got something else to say?

194
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:18,109
I felt this the last time too,

195
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,898
but you have a tendency to just say
what you want to say and take off.

196
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:23,662
It's rude to cut someone
off in conversations.

197

-Aren't I right?
-So? What do you want to say?

You read the card, but I'll let it slide
because it was my mistake.

200

But whether I have bad taste
or not, why do you even care?

201
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,143
It's none of your business.

202
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,832
Why do I care? Well, I never cared.

203
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:41,265
And I do not want to care.

204
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:46,076
It's wrong to look down on
others just because you're rich.

205
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,231
People come before money.
It's not the other way around.

206

Fine, I'll give you the money.

No, after the reward,
I only owe you 2,500 dollars.

but don't look down on me like that, okay?

211

You got that?

212
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:06,632
Legal action, my foot.

213
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,298
Did you think that would scare me?

214
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:27,131

Congratulations, O Sol.

I knew you'd make it happen.

218

This is nothing.

It's not fully cooked yet.
Don't be so greedy.

244

Slow down. Eat slowly.

-A job interview?

250

I'm impressed.

252
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,665
Make some efforts.

-Your specialty is running?

Yes. I was an athlete until 10th grade.

Yes. Track and field is

As you said, to be a good runner,

you need not only strength but
also quick reflexes and stamina.

when you work at an office too.

00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:58,862
-Just a second.
-Sure.

324
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,426
I found that jerk.

325
00:22:06,845 --> 00:22:08,646
Come here right now.

326
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:13,227
Do you see that girl with
long hair at 10 o'clock?

327
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,735
I bet my hand that she'll
ask me out in five seconds.

328
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:19,224
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

329
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,463
Do you want to say something to me?

330
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:22,627
Excuse me.

331
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,428
Can I have your phone number?

332
00:22:26,174 --> 00:22:27,174
No, you can't.

333
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,994
Gosh, he's so pretentious.

334
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,960
You're pretty, but you
don't have a good taste.

335
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,316
Do you want to have my number instead?

336
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,427
Stop right there, all of you!

337
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,727
Are you Lee Dong Hyeon?

338
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:53,505
Gosh, you look so sly.

339
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:54,660
Yeong Sik.

340
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,561
What do you like so much about this punk?

341
00:22:58,626 --> 00:22:59,626
I'm not him.

342
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:03,620
Dong Hyeon, this guy wants to talk to you.

343
00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:10,899
As a former athlete,

344
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:13,222
I don't want to hit a person.

345
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,105
We'll have a fight here,

346
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,628
and the winner can have Eun Hee.

347
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:19,832
I'm not interested.

348
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:20,690
What?

349
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,968
I'm not interested in her,
whatever her name is.

350
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,027
Are we done now?

351
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:29,536
You jerk.

352
00:23:30,226 --> 00:23:32,560
Did you just make Eun Hee cry?

353
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:35,111
Hey. Shouldn't we head
back to the office?

354
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,372
I'm leaving.

355
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,860
You're just leaving like that?

356
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:41,015
I thought it was getting interesting.

357
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,827
Wait for me.

358
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,560
Stop right there!

359
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,409
-You punk!
-Dong Hyeon.

360
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:57,960
Stop getting on my nerves.

361
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,611
You're good.

362
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:04,493
I'm bleeding.

363
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:07,827
Why don't you stop now?

364
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:11,426
Yeong Sik.

365
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,161
What is it? Are you scared?

366
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:15,372
Jae Min, are you okay?

367
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,572
Yeong Sik, are you okay?

368
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,772
I think my nose is broken.

369
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,805
I'm okay. Bring it on.

370
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,705
Be a man and confront me.

371
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,127
Yeong Sik.

372
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,428
-Yeong Sik!
-This will be your last day.

373
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:31,797
Yeong Sik!

374
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,660
Please stop!

375
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,393
Are you out of your mind?

376
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:49,360
Come here!

377
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:52,338
Let's play together!

378
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:56,093
-Make a circle.
-Make a circle.

379
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:57,549
-Go round and round.
-Go round and round.

380
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,326
Gosh, my legs hurt.

381
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:08,071
Can I come tomorrow too?

382
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,872
You don't have to come here so often.

383
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,272
Even if you show up here
tomorrow, I won't see you.

384
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,328
You can't do this to me.

385
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:14,972
Now that the spirit is gone,

386
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,761
you're the only one I can rely on.

387
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,105
There they go again.

388
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:22,972
Straighten your shoulders
and be confident.

389
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,227
You can do this!

390
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:25,591
Whatever.

391
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:31,130
It's her.

392
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,014
Ma'am!

393
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:36,237
You're the fortune teller at
the intersection, aren't you?

394
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:38,429
Who are you?

395
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,939
I once asked you when I'd get a job,

396
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:44,227
and you said I'd be lucky this year.

397
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,127
You must be mistaken.

398
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,605
No, I'm not. I'm sure it's you. Ma'am!

399
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:49,826
Hey, the girl downstairs!

400
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,926
Did you have another interview?

401
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:55,526
You're busy these days.

402
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:59,194
So when can we have rib eye steaks?

403
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,661
Rib eye steaks, my foot.

404
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:03,900
Do you think it's that easy
to get a job these days?

405
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:05,426
Gosh, you startled me.

406
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,225
Why would you yell at me?

407
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:10,660
How do you know the lady...

408
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,949
...who just left?

409
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:13,893
The lady who just left?

410
00:26:16,393 --> 00:26:18,960
Well... It's a secret. Why?

411
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:20,629
Secret?

412
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,751
What about the other woman?

413
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,326
Stop prying into my personal life.

414
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,038
Are you interested in me, by any chance?

415
00:26:28,126 --> 00:26:29,472
What are you talking about?

416
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,428
It's just that strangers
keep coming to my house.

417
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,372
If that fortune teller
lady shows up here again,

418
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,061
you have to tell me.

419
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,705
She's a fraud.
I even bought talismans from her.

420
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:43,761
As if I'm going to be lucky this year!

421
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,727
Tell me when she comes to see you.

422
00:27:09,398 --> 00:27:11,598
Why is it so hard to get a job?

423
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
Is it my bad year?
Nothing seems to be going right.

424
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:26,394
(Gihyeon Motors, NG Electronics,
Shimwon Display)

425
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:37,060
I thought everything would go well
once I got a job interview.

426
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,461
How could there be nothing
that's right for me?

427
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,760
Hello?

428
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:58,904
What are those pink idiots?

429
00:27:58,993 --> 00:27:59,827
An idol group?

430
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,049
Come over here.

431
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:04,027
He's calling us pink idol
wannabes because of you.

432
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,795
Be quiet. This is already embarrassing.

433
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,906
-You be quiet.
-Stay out of it, you punk.

434
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:09,161
Hey, quiet down.

435
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:11,939
How could you get into a gang fight
in a children's playground?

436
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:13,594
It wasn't a gang fight.

437
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,760
These punks started it first.

438
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,660
Do you see my crooked nose?

439
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,127
-I'm really a victim.
-Shut it!

440
00:28:20,216 --> 00:28:21,583
Seriously!

441
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,226
Look at this guy. He's a total scumbag.

442
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:29,259
Mister, you already
have a criminal record.

443
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:32,296
You have a criminal record?

444
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:34,593
It's not me!

445
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,827
It isn't me either.

446
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,628
Then what? Is it me? Or him?

447
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,928
-Can I help you?
-I received a phone call.

448
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,460
I'm here to see my employees.

449
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:02,926
It's dangerous to hire just
anyone in your cleaning agency.

450
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:05,643
You should run a background check
if you don't want to regret it later.

451
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:07,998
What? What do you mean?

452
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,394
That guy even has a criminal record.
Didn't you know?

453
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,616
A criminal record?

454
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:15,372
He doesn't even have a family
member who can verify his identity.

455
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,395
How could you be so reckless
when you hire people?

456
00:29:19,094 --> 00:29:20,161
(Police Station)

457
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:39,639
Are you heading back to the office?

458
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:40,581
What?

459
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:43,315
Yes.

460
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:44,962
I knew it.

461
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,705
I hardly lose when it
comes to fist fights,

462
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:50,658
and it seemed strange.

463
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,783
That explains it.

464
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,790
Gil O Dol! You...

465
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:05,647
O Sol.

466
00:30:05,736 --> 00:30:06,681
Hello, O Sol.

467
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,109
Fire them right away.

468
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,693
What do you mean?

469
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,939
Didn't you hear what that officer said?

470
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:17,895
They assaulted our employees first.

471
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:20,848
Why don't we just wrap this up
with disciplinary action?

472
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,989
They fought in their uniforms
in front of a client's house.

473
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,526
Isn't this more than enough to fire them?

474
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,461
Is this because of Dong Hyeon?

475
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,998
-If it's because of what...
-About his criminal record?

476
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:35,869
If I cared about something like that,

477
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,091
I wouldn't have hired
him in the first place.

478
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:40,972
-You knew?
-Do you think I hired him,

479
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,405
without knowing something
important like that?

480
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:44,693
Then why...

481
00:30:46,017 --> 00:30:49,915
Dong Hyeon and Jae Min have been
with us since this company opened.

482
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,994
-Firing them so easily like this...
-So what?

483
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:56,462
You want me to cut them some slack...

484
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:59,054
...since I've grown friendly with them?

485
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:03,495
Ms. Kwon, that's not
the way to run a company.

486
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,693
At times like this, you're just like...

487
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:11,390
...your grandfather, Chairman Cha.

488
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:15,261
Cleaning Fairy has a reputation...

489
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:19,369
...for being responsible and sincere
compared to other companies.

490
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,093
It's all thanks to our welfare
and great working environment.

491
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,894
But do you know how many people
are left among the initial members?

492
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,994
It's just three.
Me, Dong Hyeon, and Jae Min.

493
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:33,897
Poor cleaning, poor attitude, being tardy.

494
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:36,186
You never listened to their stories...

495
00:31:36,343 --> 00:31:38,777
...and just fired them
whenever they bothered you.

496
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,285
I can't even remember how many times...

497
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:43,841
...you changed your housekeeper
for these reasons.

498
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,227
Is it wrong to take care of things
according to company regulations?

499
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:50,960
It's not wrong.

500
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:54,560
But I don't think
you're doing it right either.

501
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,326
Anyone can make mistakes.

502
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:17,727
We can't be perfect.

503
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,893
It goes the same for cleanliness.

504
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:45,470
Hello?

505
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:48,459
Tomorrow is Grandpa's birthday.

506
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,027
You didn't forget, did you?

507
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:52,872
I know. Is this why you called?

508
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,160
Well, not exactly.

509
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,695
You sound irritated.

510
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,006
Is something wrong?

511
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,494
Let's talk later. I'm busy.

512
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:06,593
I'm trying to tell him
for his own benefit.

513
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,727
It feels like I'm talking
with my boss, not my son.

514
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:13,827
Ms. Cha.

515
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,927
What's wrong with your face
on a great day like this?

516
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,628
Who is it? Should I take care of him?

517
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:20,994
There is someone...

518
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:23,614
...whom I have no control
over in this entire world.

519
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,426
That one person.

520
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,960
What kind of punk is stressing you out?

521
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:32,561
That punk is none other than
Ms. Cha's son.

522
00:33:35,027 --> 00:33:36,060
Ms. Cha's son?

523
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:37,379
Wait.

524
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,215
Ms. Cha was married?

525
00:33:40,493 --> 00:33:42,760
-Is she a widow then?
-A single mother.

526
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,224
A single mother?

527
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,527
Ms. Cha!

528
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:55,760
-I'm sorry, O Sol.
-I don't know what to say.

529
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
You fought when you're supposed
to practice taekwondo?

530
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:00,679
Gil O Dol.

531
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,648
Do you want to give up
on becoming an athlete?

532
00:34:02,737 --> 00:34:03,870
I said I didn't hit...

533
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:08,861
-I just tried to scare them a bit.
-I don't care.

534
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,438
Don't do anything stupid
before your entrance exam.

535
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:13,906
You're not going to tell Dad, are you?

536
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:16,394
Why? Are you afraid you might be scolded?

537
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:17,950
I don't want him to get worried.

538
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,527
Of course, I won't tell him.
It's nothing to brag about.

539
00:34:27,259 --> 00:34:28,926
All you did was scare them?

540
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:31,521
You should've dragged them into
a corner and beat them up.

541
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:33,932
It makes me upset seeing
your faces like this.

542
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,462
I did hit him once.

543
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:39,544
I landed a straight right
on that idiot's face...

544
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,401
I'm sorry.

545
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:45,772
Eat up.

546
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:47,408
Let's eat.

547
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:59,659
(Stop)

548
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:16,393
Mr. Gil Gong Tae.

549
00:35:17,793 --> 00:35:21,786
Due to the company's situation,
we can't extend your contract.

550
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,296
Thank you for your hard work.

551
00:35:30,827 --> 00:35:33,528
200 dollars for the academy,

552
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:37,261
4,500 dollars for the student loan,

553
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,693
plus...

554
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,138
(Day to pay back 3,500 dollars!)

555
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:45,127
3,500 dollars to pay back
for the repair cost.

556
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:52,593
Goodness...

557
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,858
Why is there so much to pay?

558
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,594
O Sol.

559
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,334
Are you asleep, my daughter?

560
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,500
You came home just now?

561
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,299
I know it's hard looking for a job.

562
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,732
I'm sorry...

563
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:38,194
...for being a poor father.

564
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,044
Did you drink?

565
00:36:44,132 --> 00:36:46,532
No, I didn't drink.

566
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:51,265
Go to sleep.

567
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,900
I'm sorry for waking you.

568
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,167
-Go to sleep, Dad.
-Okay.

569
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,211
(Entrepreneur of the Year)

570
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,900
(Excellence Award)

571
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:12,733
On my father's birthday,

572
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,333
with my happy family.

573
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,267
Flowers and Mae Hwa.

574
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,002
Mae Hwa is prettier than the flowers.

575
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:27,633
He's so silly.

576
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:31,378
Dinner is ready, ma'am.
Chairman Cha will come downstairs shortly.

577
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:32,499
Already?

578
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,699
Seon Gyeol, you must be hungry. Let's go.

579
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:37,866
I told them to make many delicious things.

580
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:48,712
Everything's been disinfected.
Shall I do it again for you?

581
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,534
No, it's okay.

582
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,900
You still haven't cured
yourself of that disorder.

583
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,803
Dad, you're here.

584
00:39:04,158 --> 00:39:05,325
How have you been?

585
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:15,000
A little bit of dust can't kill you.

586
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:17,533
When I was in the military,

587
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,144
all of us slept together
in a hole in the ground,

588
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,499
and I even ate rice mixed with sand
when I was in Saudi Arabia.

589
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:25,940
But I'm still alive and
robust as you can see.

590
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,366
I find it hard to believe,

591
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,651
but you say you used to be covered
in dust at construction sites,

592
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,947
and couldn't even shower for days,

593
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,943
to meet deadlines for demolishing
and constructing buildings.

594
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:37,429
You say that's how you made it this far.

595
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,933
I've heard that story so many times...

596
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:43,042
...that I know it by heart now.

597
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,400
You two, again.

598
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,778
Why are you bickering
with each other already?

599
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:50,567
Let's not do that and eat.

600
00:39:51,433 --> 00:39:52,533
Oh, right.

601
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,159
Ta-da.

602
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,988
Happy birthday.

603
00:39:58,455 --> 00:40:00,922
Please stay healthy and live a long life.

604
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,432
Water, please.

605
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,132
Let's eat.

606
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,766
We're finally having dinner together
after so long. Isn't this nice?

607
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:32,100
Seon Gyeol, by the way, who is Geum Ja?

608
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,211
The other day,

609
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,251
you went crazy trying
to find Geum Ja at home.

610
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,892
Who is Geum Ja? Is it a person?

611
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:39,334
Or...

612
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:42,052
...do you have a pet now?

613
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:43,241
You don't need to know.

614
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,928
How dare you talk to your mother
in that manner?

615
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,366
Don't use a deceased person's name.

616
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,000
It'll bring bad luck.

617
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,065
A deceased person?

618
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,011
Who is Geum Ja? Tell me.

619
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,299
The person who raised me.

620
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:03,633
In your place, Mother.

621
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,569
That nanny?

622
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,315
I heard she passed away
from lung cancer five years ago.

623
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:16,603
I didn't know that
lady's name was Geum Ja.

624
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,747
But like Dad said,
you shouldn't use her name...

625
00:41:19,836 --> 00:41:21,770
...because she's dead now.

626
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:23,536
That's creepy.

627
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,404
Oh, right. Did you see, Dad?

628
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:34,315
I think Seon Gyeol's
business is doing very well.

629
00:41:34,403 --> 00:41:36,916
I see it everywhere these days,
from TV shows to magazines.

630
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:39,716
I thought he was just fooling
around with his cleaning business,

631
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:40,937
but I'm so proud now.

632
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,070
That being said,

633
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,382
how about you start
training him at AG now?

634
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,737
I'm not interested.

635
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:53,394
You have to learn the job.
Will you run that business forever?

636
00:41:53,483 --> 00:41:57,071
It's not like there's another
heir that can inherit AG Group.

637
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,961
I cannot pass my company down
to someone with such a flaw.

638
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,204
No, I have no interest
in passing it down to him.

639
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:06,449
So, he can clean all he wants
for the rest of his life.

640
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:08,604
-Dad.
-Germaphobia?

641
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:11,548
What a fancy name. In reality,
it's nothing but a mental illness.

642
00:42:11,637 --> 00:42:13,749
You developed that illness because
you're mentally unhealthy.

643
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,082
Why do you have to be like this, Dad?

644
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,516
How could you say that to
your one and only grandson?

645
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:19,737
I sent you to the States so that
you can treat the condition,

646
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,104
and you started a cleaning
business upon your return.

647
00:42:24,136 --> 00:42:25,043
Why?

648
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:28,076
Did you want to clean the world
according to your standards?

649
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:31,394
How did you know?

650
00:42:32,894 --> 00:42:35,695
I can't stand filth.

651
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,305
It looks like your place is
also full of bacteria, Grandpa.

652
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:44,473
I don't think I can stand
being in this space.

653
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,727
May I leave?

654
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,204
You rude brat!

655
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:55,832
What on earth are you doing, Dad?

656
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,629
Seon Gyeol, are you all right?

657
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,222
You're bleeding. Look, please...

658
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:04,812
Please go bring the first aid kit.

659
00:43:18,992 --> 00:43:20,559
You still got that temper.

660
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:22,993
Just like when I was little.

661
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,325
Happy birthday.

662
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,460
I wish you a long life, Grandpa.

663
00:43:37,225 --> 00:43:39,225
Seon Gyeol. Wait, Seon Gyeol!

664
00:43:41,681 --> 00:43:44,981
Dad, why do you have
to treat him like that?

665
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:48,727
You know it's been so long
since we last gathered.

666
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,211
Seon Gyeol, Seon Gyeol!

667
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:56,705
We're sorry to disappoint you,

668
00:43:56,793 --> 00:43:59,594
but you're not the candidate
that this company is looking for.

669
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:39,259
Darn it.

670
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:43,794
Gosh, what a mess!

671
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:48,260
Nothing is going my way.

672
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:59,059
(Interviewee Identification Slip)

673
00:45:15,058 --> 00:45:16,091
Seon Gyeol!

674
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:21,193
Look at you. You look filthy!

675
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:23,893
What on earth happened to you?
Take your clothes off!

676
00:45:24,392 --> 00:45:25,692
Go wipe the dirt off this instant!

677
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,459
Jang Seon Gyeol.

678
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:33,638
Didn't I tell you that you must
always look clean and well-kept?

679
00:45:33,726 --> 00:45:35,160
Because your mom is not around,

680
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,104
you have to look spotlessly
clean at all times.

681
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,071
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

682
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:41,705
-Cleanliness comes first!
-I won't do it again.

683
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:42,926
Maintain cleanliness at all times.

684
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:44,958
Who do you take after?

685
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,325
Why won't you listen to me?

686
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:50,091
I'm sorry.

687
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:54,292
Chairman Cha doesn't hate you.

688
00:45:54,392 --> 00:45:55,893
You know that, right?

689
00:45:57,392 --> 00:46:00,438
He's just worried that other
people might judge you.

690
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:02,659
That's why he gets mad
at you over things like that,

691
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,893
so don't take it to heart.

692
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:07,173
Geum Ja.

693
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:10,826
Yes, Seon Gyeol.

694
00:46:12,192 --> 00:46:14,492
When will my mom come
back from the States?

695
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:18,268
Ms. Cha will come home in 10 days.

696
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:19,826
You're lying.

697
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:24,425
You said the exact same thing last time.
10 days again?

698
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,093
Do you miss your mom a lot,

699
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:29,826
Young Master?

700
00:46:31,826 --> 00:46:32,993
No.

701
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,225
It's just that, now that Mom is gone,

702
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:42,326
Grandpa seems to be angry at me.

703
00:46:46,058 --> 00:46:47,892
He keeps scolding me...

704
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,358
...because Mom isn't here with me...

705
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:53,993
...and I don't have a dad.

706
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:15,093
92...

707
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,559
93...

708
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,126
94...

709
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:29,859
94...

710
00:47:31,192 --> 00:47:32,292
94.

711
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:37,093
95...

712
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:41,059
96...

713
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:00,411
3,500 Dollars.

714
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:03,126
We keep running into each other.

715
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:08,260
Do you live around here?

716
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:14,692
You live in that building
where only rich people live, right?

717
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:18,629
That super high and fancy-looking one.
Am I right?

718
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,726
What a coincidence.

719
00:48:23,893 --> 00:48:25,427
Do you want to join me?

720
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:28,475
Have a seat.

721
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:30,859
It's my treat.

722
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,258
Hey.

723
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:42,993
I'm sorry,

724
00:48:44,392 --> 00:48:47,360
but I don't think I can
pay you by next week.

725
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:52,559
I had a job interview today.

726
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:56,025
I was going to pay you...

727
00:48:56,659 --> 00:48:59,426
...as soon as I land a job.

728
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:05,093
But I blew it.

729
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:09,794
To tell you the truth,
I've been failing...

730
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,592
...every single interview I've had so far.

731
00:49:17,726 --> 00:49:19,260
I look stupid, right?

732
00:49:23,592 --> 00:49:25,059
You seem very drunk.

733
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,225
You should go home.

734
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:30,258
Hold on.

735
00:49:32,492 --> 00:49:34,087
You know what?

736
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:35,752
I...

737
00:49:36,925 --> 00:49:38,592
...used to be an athlete...

738
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:41,125
...back in school.

739
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:44,192
You know what a hurdle race is, right?

740
00:49:46,759 --> 00:49:49,504
I'd never fallen once.

741
00:49:49,592 --> 00:49:51,393
I was amazing.

742
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:55,425
I'd jump over...

743
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,559
...all the hurdles in front of me.

744
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:01,826
So...

745
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,026
...my dad...

746
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:08,325
...used to be so proud of me.

747
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:18,058
But...

748
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:22,526
...I keep falling these days.

749
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:28,293
I don't know what's wrong with me.

750
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:34,727
I keep falling even if I don't want to.

751
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:44,826
Oh, these.

752
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:50,425
You don't know what these are, do you?

753
00:50:53,225 --> 00:50:55,126
There are...

754
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,892
...97 pens in total.

755
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:03,761
These are the pens and pencils I used...

756
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:06,292
...while applying for jobs.

757
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:17,392
This is my youth.

758
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:24,260
This is my effort.

759
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,626
This is my expectation.

760
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,059
This is my hope.

761
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:46,326
I took them out to throw them away.

762
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,593
But I can't seem to bring myself to do it.

763
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,459
Should I continue until 100?

764
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,960
Gosh, this is so funny.

765
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,671
Why do I keep making a fool of myself...

766
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:10,961
...in front of you?

767
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:14,559
I'm sorry.

768
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:18,764
I wasted your precious time again.

769
00:52:19,426 --> 00:52:20,459
I apologize.

770
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:37,339
I should get going.

771
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:46,525
Gosh.

772
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:51,086
Wait.

773
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:52,614
Your shoes.

774
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:55,518
-What?
-Those...

775
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,193
Oh, right.

776
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:13,458
Are you okay?

777
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:17,326
Gosh.

778
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:19,893
These stupid shoes.

779
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,826
They're all broken.

780
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,726
They keep getting in my way.

781
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:33,892
Can you get up?

782
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:45,892
You got hurt too.

783
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,859
It must hurt.

784
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:10,592
Come on.

785
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:18,825
Gosh.

786
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:26,425
Wait...

787
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:43,584
Hey.

788
00:54:48,859 --> 00:54:50,193
Wear these instead.

789
00:54:51,092 --> 00:54:52,225
You shouldn't walk barefoot.

790
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:00,258
Thank you.

791
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:39,592
Aren't you the girl from downstairs?

792
00:55:45,392 --> 00:55:46,592
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

793
00:55:49,992 --> 00:55:51,759
Get up.

794
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:53,659
You shouldn't sleep outside.

795
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,726
Put it down.

796
00:56:06,025 --> 00:56:08,659
Times have changed.

797
00:56:10,259 --> 00:56:12,638
You can't sleep outside anymore.

798
00:56:12,726 --> 00:56:16,060
What are you doing right now? Who are you?

799
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,392
Gosh.

800
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:32,599
Hey.

801
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:51,425
Gosh, she's much heavier than I thought.

802
00:56:53,793 --> 00:56:55,193
What's wrong with me?

803
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,041
I should've just kept running
like when I was in high school.

804
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,626
I thought if I gave up everything,

805
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:13,560
I would be able to live
normally like anyone else.

806
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,860
But why is it so difficult?

807
00:57:17,492 --> 00:57:20,259
My life is a total mess.

808
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:32,360
Don't struggle on your own so much.

809
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:36,359
Don't try to live like others either.

810
00:57:37,726 --> 00:57:40,260
If you try a bit less than others,

811
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:44,559
you'll receive less stress
than others as well.

812
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:46,692
That's how you should live.

813
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:50,660
That's how you win.

814
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,058
Good morning.

815
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:37,059
Are these yours?

816
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:38,259
They're not mine.

817
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,126
My slippers have three lines in them.

818
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:43,937
You came home in those last night.

819
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:45,859
What? I did?

820
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:53,091
You got hurt too.

821
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:57,127
It must hurt.

822
00:59:04,426 --> 00:59:06,593
I have lost my mind!

823
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:20,937
Can I help you?

824
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:24,137
I've posted an announcement
for recruiting new employees.

825
00:59:24,225 --> 00:59:25,292
Please confirm it.

826
00:59:27,459 --> 00:59:29,393
Have Hwang Jae Min and
Lee Dong Hyeon's termination...

827
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:31,392
...been processed as I requested?

828
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:35,360
It will be taken care of within the day.

829
00:59:41,893 --> 00:59:44,794
If I revoke my order...

830
00:59:45,426 --> 00:59:47,060
...on firing those two...

831
00:59:47,726 --> 00:59:50,126
...do I become a different
person from my grandpa?

832
00:59:51,526 --> 00:59:52,626
No.

833
00:59:54,192 --> 00:59:57,359
But you'll be able to
become a better owner.

834
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,826
Yes! Great!

835
01:00:36,392 --> 01:00:38,137
Can we get some more beers?

836
01:00:38,225 --> 01:00:40,126
Okay, I'll be right there.

837
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:48,904
Okay. Two more beers for table 1.

838
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:50,970
Miss, can we get some more nachos?

839
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:52,358
Okay.

840
01:00:54,893 --> 01:00:56,160
Thank you.

841
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:03,459
(Balance: 1,480 dollars)

842
01:01:13,759 --> 01:01:15,126
Dad, can you give me some...

843
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,726
Dad, do you have some
money you can lend me?

844
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:27,571
To tell you the truth,
when I filled in for you last time,

845
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:29,093
I got in an accident.

846
01:01:30,392 --> 01:01:32,525
I'll pay you back once I get a job.

847
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,192
Let's do it.

848
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:01,404
(They promised me a permanent contract...)

849
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:04,398
(...but I was suddenly kicked out
on the streets for no reason)

850
01:02:25,683 --> 01:02:26,759
(You can do this, Gil O Sol!)

(Cleaning Fairy)

852
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:36,726
Cleaning Fairy?

(Cleaning Fairy Fitness Test

854
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:42,473
Number 19.

855
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,192
Number 10.

856
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:48,191
Number 11. Please take
your identification slip.

857
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,937
What am I doing here?

858
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,009
O Sol.

859
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:11,196
What are you doing here?

860
01:03:13,225 --> 01:03:14,292
Yeong Sik.

861
01:03:14,925 --> 01:03:18,895
What are you... That's what I want to ask.

862
01:03:19,067 --> 01:03:19,903
Me?

863
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,458
I've come...

864
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:23,774
...to a tiger den to catch a tiger.

865
01:03:23,863 --> 01:03:26,063
A tiger? What do you mean?

866
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:28,028
I'll tell you later.

867
01:03:28,117 --> 01:03:29,985
But why are you here?

868
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:33,261
No way...

869
01:03:33,826 --> 01:03:36,533
Are you here to take the fitness test
for the cleaning company?

870
01:03:36,622 --> 01:03:38,189
Hey! How could you...

871
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:42,526
How could you think that? You're so silly.

872
01:03:42,692 --> 01:03:44,771
I was just enjoying the nice weather...

873
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:47,570
...and came here for a stroll
and do some exercise.

874
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:50,638
I think they're holding
some event over here.

875
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:52,271
Number 44, Gil O Sol.

876
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:53,626
-Yes!
-Yes?

877
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,959
I think it's your turn, O Sol.

878
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:01,098
It's my turn now, right?

879
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:03,593
-Ms. Gil O Sol?
-I'll be back.

880
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:06,959
-Number 45, Lee Ah Reum?
-Yes.

881
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,759
Get ready.

882
01:04:10,025 --> 01:04:11,626
Let's go, Gil O Sol!

883
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:54,045
Get ready.

884
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:03,759
(Junior Track and Field Competition)

885
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:30,659
Ready.

886
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:38,760
Until my first year in high school,
I was a track and field athlete.

887
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:44,104
So far, I didn't think
my skills from back then...

888
01:05:44,192 --> 01:05:45,426
...were helpful for me in any way.

889
01:05:54,022 --> 01:05:56,356
Who knew they'd be so
useful at this very moment?

890
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:13,211
Hello, sir.

891
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,059
You're here, sir.

892
01:06:18,216 --> 01:06:21,247
-What... What's going on?
-Thank you so much...

893
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:22,570
...for deciding not to fire me.

894
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:24,893
I'll work even harder from now on.

895
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:26,223
I love you, sir.

896
01:06:26,312 --> 01:06:27,779
-I love you!
-No, stop it.

897
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,986
That's enough. I had no
choice but to put it off...

898
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:34,723
...as we're back up with orders,
so you don't need to thank me.

899
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:46,900
Gosh, that obnoxious stuck-up.

900
01:06:50,058 --> 01:06:51,225
Sir.

901
01:06:52,695 --> 01:06:53,895
I know I disappointed you.

902
01:06:55,575 --> 01:06:56,526
I'm sorry.

903
01:06:56,817 --> 01:06:59,051
That will never happen again.

904
01:07:01,203 --> 01:07:03,915
The first time is a mistake,
but the second time is a choice.

905
01:07:04,048 --> 01:07:06,982
It's your life, so don't make
a choice like that again.

906
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,859
I believe in you.

907
01:07:13,259 --> 01:07:14,526
No matter what anyone says,

908
01:07:16,492 --> 01:07:17,400
I trust you.

909
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:28,725
The fitness test has been completed.

910
01:07:28,814 --> 01:07:31,114
Today, we'll proceed with the orientation.

911
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:33,326
Thank you for your hard work.

912
01:07:34,937 --> 01:07:37,969
We discovered a real gem
during the fitness test.

913
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:40,214
You'll be happy to see her as well.

914
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:41,370
The other day...

915
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:43,911
Thank you for pushing
the payment deadline.

916
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,748
I'll return your slippers soon.

917
01:07:47,754 --> 01:07:50,170
Also, about that day...

918
01:07:50,259 --> 01:07:51,942
...I didn't make any mistakes, did I?

919
01:07:52,031 --> 01:07:53,504
Don't worry about the slippers.
Just throw them out.

920
01:07:53,592 --> 01:07:56,159
I hope we never cross paths again.

921
01:07:56,426 --> 01:07:58,009
How obnoxious.

922
01:08:03,648 --> 01:08:07,245
O Sol, isn't this office nicer
and cleaner than you expected?

923
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:08,467
Well, it's not bad.

924
01:08:09,404 --> 01:08:11,305
Hey, you didn't tell O Dol...

925
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,149
...that we'll be working together, right?

926
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:14,416
Yes, not yet.

927
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:17,116
You absolutely cannot tell him
about me working here, okay?

928
01:08:17,204 --> 01:08:19,183
If my family finds out,

929
01:08:19,271 --> 01:08:21,817
I won't even ask you any questions
and beat you up to a pulp,

930
01:08:21,905 --> 01:08:24,205
-so consider yourself informed.
-All right.

931
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:25,776
If that's what you want.

932
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:28,509
Your secret is safe with me.

933
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,285
I'm sorry to keep you waiting so long.

934
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:31,938
Please follow me.

935
01:08:33,871 --> 01:08:35,972
I wonder if we'll have a
pretty new hire this year.

936
01:08:36,061 --> 01:08:39,128
You know, someone who looks
like Seolhyun or Suzy.

937
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,281
What? Isn't he that guy?

938
01:08:45,585 --> 01:08:47,286
That jerk who punched my nose.
Oh, my gosh!

939
01:08:48,237 --> 01:08:49,437
What's that jerk doing here?

940
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,620
Sir.

941
01:08:54,705 --> 01:08:57,139
These are our new hires.

942
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:58,972
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

943
01:09:00,738 --> 01:09:01,870
3,500 dollars?

944
01:09:07,504 --> 01:09:08,671
You're the CEO?

945
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:10,583
Horse Head?

946
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:12,172
Someone once said...

947
01:09:12,455 --> 01:09:14,951
...that serendipity turns a blind eye
to you when you want it to happen...

948
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:18,105
...but that it bestows its magic
upon you when you don't want it.

949
01:09:18,563 --> 01:09:20,723
Just like such cruel rules of life,

950
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:23,938
another coincidence took place for us.

951
01:09:40,565 --> 01:09:42,865
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

952
01:09:43,034 --> 01:09:44,847
So you're saying that guy, 3,500 dollars,

953
01:09:44,936 --> 01:09:47,349
is the CEO of Cleaning Fairy?

954
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:48,717
-Sir, please.
-Gosh.

955
01:09:48,805 --> 01:09:51,139
How about another round of a drink?

956
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,695
Gil O Sol!

957
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:54,817
Isn't it so odd?

958
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:57,938
He's a total germaphobe.
He's obviously got problems.

959
01:09:58,204 --> 01:10:00,072
Let go of her hand. Don't you hear me?

960
01:10:00,274 --> 01:10:03,453
-I told you to let go of her hand.
-There's no way you're dating him.

961
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:05,153
Did you ask him to act
as if he's your boyfriend?

962
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:06,342
He is my boyfriend.

963
01:10:06,431 --> 01:10:09,377
Unlike you, who looks down on
those who do this kind of work,

964
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:10,466
he's a wonderful person.

965
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:24,772
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
