00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,100
(O Sol's Room)

00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,533
(Kim Yoojung)

00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,166
(Yoon Kyunsang)

00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,135
(Song Jaerim)

00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,135
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,935
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,367
Did you sleep well?

8
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:00,546
Yes. You must be going out early today.

9
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,034
You're already dressed.

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,832
I always dress like this at home.

11
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,832
What?

12
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:12,131
I see.

13
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:15,389
We should...

14
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:16,866
...have breakfast.

15
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:17,977
Well...

16
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:19,699
...I'll make you breakfast...

17
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,065
...so let's eat together.

18
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:22,833
No, that's fine.

19
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:24,231
I...

20
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:26,432
Here we go.

21
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,231
Just stay seated right here.

22
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,297
Mr. Jang, can I help you with anything...

23
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:08,519
O Sol, stop!

24
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,943
The cooking is going very smoothly,

25
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:18,198
so you can sit back and
read a book or watch TV.

26
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:19,566
It will be ready soon.

27
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:20,333
(I wish you good luck, Chef Jang)

28
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,198
This way.

29
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:31,833
I can go by myself.

30
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,200
-This way, please.
-What?

31
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,198
Come and sit.

32
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:07,498
It's been a while since I've cooked.

33
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,232
What are you doing?

34
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:12,298
Go on and try it.

35
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:17,566
Okay. Thank you for the meal.

36
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:19,632
It's pasta.

37
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:22,198
Thank you.

38
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:32,565
It's nice.

39
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,832
Gosh.

40
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,698
You should eat slowly.

41
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:50,065
Okay.

42
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,732
Hold on.

43
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,832
Are you a celebrity or what?

44
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,799
Hey, stop overreacting.

45
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:19,865
Think about it. Why would O Dol
or Mr. Gil be here at this hour?

46
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:24,144
Hey, you never know
what can happen in life.

47
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:26,200
You have to be prepared for all scenarios.

48
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:29,132
Gosh, you embarrass me.

49
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,200
So? Is staying there okay?

50
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:43,843
No, I can't even breathe.

51
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:46,444
I think Mr. Jang is trying
to suffocate me to death.

52
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:47,711
I knew it.

53
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,344
I mean, how are you going
to cure his mysophobia?

54
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,644
You're filthy.

55
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,799
Hey, he said I'm not filthy.

56
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,064
He can stand my filth.

57
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:05,065
Why are you being like this?

58
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,798
-What do you mean?
-This bothers me.

59
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,344
Are you bothered by me?

60
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,899
No, I mean,
don't I make you uncomfortable?

61
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,044
I get food all over my face,

62
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:20,232
and I spill food everywhere as well.
Are you really okay with it?

63
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:21,499
Yes, it's fine.

64
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,700
It'd bother me if it were someone else,

65
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,164
but it's fine because it's you.

66
00:06:40,832 --> 00:06:43,132
What? He actually said that?

67
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,833
There's more.

68
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,333
Darn it. Gosh.

69
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,378
For things like this,

70
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,554
you can ask me anytime.

71
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:42,699
What? Is that a heart?

72
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:00,399
It's not a heart. It can't be.

73
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,031
No way.

74
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,699
Bravo, bravo. Hey, O Sol.

75
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,448
Since this already happened,

76
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,109
you should just make him yours.

77
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,365
Make him all yours.

78
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:18,965
Here, I got this love potion for you.

79
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,698
What's this?

80
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:26,444
It's bush clover wine my dad made
when he was leaving the mountains.

81
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:28,400
Hey, bush clovers are known
to be a nighttime...

82
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,766
You know it's very good for you, right?

83
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:33,877
I brought it for you,
but you should share it with your boss.

84
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,998
Are you crazy?
Are you kidding me right now?

85
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,311
Dating isn't allowed, okay?

86
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,678
Whatever. As if.

87
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:43,533
You're living with him.
Dating isn't allowed? My foot.

88
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:45,832
Just listen to me, okay?

89
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,943
-I can't.
-Why can't you?

90
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,632
Be honest. You must have
some feelings for him.

91
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,999
That's why you rejected the doctor.
Am I wrong?

92
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,066
Then what about O Dol?

93
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,900
What's O Dol going to do?

94
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,865
That old geezer.
He's watched too many movies.

95
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,799
That's such an unfair stipulation.

96
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:17,632
I'm honored...

97
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:20,498
...that you wanted to meet me, Dr. Daniel.

98
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,432
My O Sol.

99
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:29,466
Where is she now?

100
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:33,232
What do you mean?

101
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,943
Are you talking about Ms. Gil O Sol?

102
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:40,131
From what I know,
you gave her a ride to Busan.

103
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,933
Please tell me where she is now.

104
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:58,266
(Dating skills)

105
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,965
(Dating strategies and tactics)

106
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:05,765
(1. Be the intelligent guy
who reads a lot)

107
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,466
(2. Be the sexy guy
who cooks for his girlfriend)

108
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,832
(3. Be the sweet guy
who takes care of his girlfriend)

109
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,899
(4. Be the brave guy
who comes to your girlfriend's rescue)

110
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:20,333
(5. Be the sensitive, sexy guy.)

111
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:28,132
She has the passcode.
Why is she ringing the doorbell?

112
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,666
Did that trick work?

113
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,466
It worked.

114
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:47,832
You're back. I've been waiting...

115
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,299
You've been waiting for me?

116
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,665
I had no idea.

117
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:55,365
Then I should've come sooner.

118
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,199
What... Wait, what are you doing here?

119
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,599
How dare you barge in?

120
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,333
Get out at once,
or I'll report you for trespassing.

121
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:05,834
-You said you were waiting for me.
-What?

122
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:09,598
Weren't you talking to me?

123
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,799
-Were you expecting someone else?
-Well...

124
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:18,344
What brings you here?

125
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,300
And how did you get my address?

126
00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:26,233
Oh, you can't misuse your patient's
personal information like this.

127
00:11:27,565 --> 00:11:29,299
Right, I do have your information.

128
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:33,166
But didn't you give me
your address in Minnesota?

129
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:43,832
I must say, you have a quirky taste.

130
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,832
Well, that's not mine.

131
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:49,599
This is mine.

132
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,998
I did buy them, but that's...

133
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:56,031
Don't fiddle with the ears.
What if they fall off?

134
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,599
This is crazy.

135
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:03,732
My, what a nice place. It's so neat.

136
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,331
I've always wanted to live
in a place like this.

137
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,999
Look, who said you could
barge into my place...

138
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,665
...and walk around like this?
I never invited you.

139
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,070
Get out. Get out of my place at once.

140
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,037
I should've introduced myself sooner.

141
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,970
Nice to meet you, Mr. Jang Seon Gyeol.

142
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,048
We'll have therapy
sessions starting today.

143
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,637
I'm your psychiatrist, Choi Ha In.

144
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,202
My psychiatrist?

145
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,269
So you're saying O Sol...

146
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:50,937
...is staying with Mr. Jang now, right?

147
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:55,336
Yes, I'm sure you're well aware...

148
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,537
...that it's part of his
cognitive behavioral therapy.

149
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,304
And Ms. Gil chose to do it.

150
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,415
I bet she had no choice but to do it...

151
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:04,770
...because she was given
an offer she couldn't refuse.

152
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,970
Let me ask you one thing.

153
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,636
If Mr. Jang's condition doesn't improve,

154
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,615
what will happen to this deal?

155
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,903
I strongly trust that his
condition will improve.

156
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,097
That's why Ms. Gil got on board.

157
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,531
I have to say,

158
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:21,469
that's such a half-hearted answer.

159
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,436
Let's think objectively.

160
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,504
Without the patient's willpower,

161
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:31,304
and solely relying
on help from a non-expert,

162
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,738
do you think that's actually possible?

163
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,404
We're trying everything we can do.

164
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:40,104
-Because we have to.
-Who?

165
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:42,737
Mr. Jang's family?

166
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,437
But their selfishness...

167
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:49,670
...might hurt someone again.

168
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:51,682
Have you never thought about that?

169
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,070
I think it's best for both their sakes.

170
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,471
-That's why I suggested it.
-It's best for everyone?

171
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,769
That's probably...

172
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,270
...only if it goes well.

173
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:06,337
Like in the mine sweeping game,
where you must avoid all mines.

174
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:12,181
What are you pondering?

175
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,369
Hello, sir.

176
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,071
I just met with Dr. Daniel.

177
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:24,071
He volunteered to be Mr. Jang's doctor.

178
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:26,369
-Seon Gyeol's doctor?
-Yes.

179
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:30,336
He said he'd visit Mr. Jang in person.

180
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,437
-That is great news.
-Yes.

181
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,969
Will Mr. Jang accept it though?

182
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:50,937
Who says you can treat me? You're a quack.

183
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,403
A quack?

184
00:14:53,403 --> 00:14:56,815
Even if Hua Tuo appears
right before your eyes,

185
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,871
he'll be nothing but a quack
if that's what you think.

186
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:02,136
"Hua Tuo"? Goodness.

187
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,914
When it comes to treating mysophobia...

188
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,836
...phone consultations were not enough.

189
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:10,703
From now on, let me stay with you...

190
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:14,671
...and try various methods.

191
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,181
Stay with me?

192
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:19,903
Who stays with who?

193
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,548
I don't need a doctor.

194
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,281
So just leave.

195
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:25,303
I'm hungry.

196
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,204
Do you have any food?

197
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:28,736
Don't be so cold.

198
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,904
-Organic?
-Covered in pesticides.

199
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,636
Is that your bathroom?

200
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,603
Stop!

201
00:15:41,136 --> 00:15:42,770
Don't use my bathroom.

202
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,237
-I have to.
-Go somewhere else.

203
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,815
Why are you talking so rudely to me?

204
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,003
What? You can talk rudely too if you want.

205
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,648
Fine.

206
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,704
We will see each other a lot from now on.
I'll be more casual.

207
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,371
Let me use your bathroom, my friend.

208
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,770
No. Hey!

209
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,870
Stop!

210
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:08,369
Gosh.

211
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:14,103
-Hi.
-Hi.

212
00:16:14,236 --> 00:16:16,648
I have a little situation here.

213
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:19,315
What do you mean?
Is there something to clean up?

214
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:21,637
-Let me go in and...
-No.

215
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:25,014
I'll clean up.
You can come back in a moment.

216
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,648
Go to a comic book cafe or something.

217
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,215
Come back when I call you.

218
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,603
Then...

219
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:32,703
O Sol, you're here.

220
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,903
I've been waiting for you.

221
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,469
What's all that?

222
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,970
Come on in.

223
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,537
Come in.

224
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:42,703
Gosh, it's so heavy.

225
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,202
Come.

226
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,470
That punk.

227
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,637
What's going on?

228
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:52,849
How did you know I was here?

229
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,749
You knew she was here?

230
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:57,048
Did you tell him?

231
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:58,169
No.

232
00:16:58,436 --> 00:17:00,469
What is this?

233
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:06,302
Does Dad know I'm here?

234
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,115
If he did, he'd go crazy.

235
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,215
I was looking forward to having
sashimi at Jagalchi Market.

236
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:11,570
So this is Busan?

237
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,448
Well...

238
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,281
By the way, you know each other?

239
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,948
Don't be ridiculous.

240
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:23,503
I have nothing to do with this quack.

241
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,104
Gosh, that hurts.

242
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,148
Don't you remember all the nights
we spent talking on the phone?

243
00:17:29,236 --> 00:17:30,803
-What?
-Are you serious?

244
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:33,382
Sorry. You denied our relationship,

245
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,037
so I got a little upset.

246
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,437
-My goodness.
-"Our..."

247
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:41,170
"...relationship"?

248
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,281
It's not like that.

249
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,569
It's not like that. Tell her it's not.

250
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,704
Ms. Gil, it's not what you think it is.

251
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,436
Tell her it's not.

252
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,070
Deny it! Tell her it's not like that!

253
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,215
Hey! It's not like that.

254
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,336
Don't look at me like that.

255
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:00,270
I... Hey!

256
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:04,469
So...

257
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:08,682
...you two originally met...

258
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,104
...for treatment purposes.

259
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:15,237
It's such a special relationship.

260
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,303
Special, my foot.

261
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,348
Like I said, I don't need a doctor.

262
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,749
I'm done now. You can leave.

263
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,048
Stop pushing me away like that.

264
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:27,981
Give me a chance.

265
00:18:28,069 --> 00:18:30,115
I'm embarrassed to say this myself,

266
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:33,281
but I'm a very competent
and famous doctor.

267
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,769
I was Dr. Fore's favorite student as well.

268
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:37,815
What's with the way you're talking to me?

269
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:39,448
Can't you be more polite?

270
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,849
You wanted us to speak more casual.

271
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,237
When did I...

272
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,037
That's great.

273
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:49,536
I mean you treating Mr. Jang.

274
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,482
I've been worried...

275
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,215
...Mr. Jang's condition might worsen...

276
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,570
...because of me.

277
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,070
If you could stay with us,

278
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:04,215
I'd feel much better.

279
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,782
Ms. Gil, what do you mean, "my condition"?

280
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,348
I'm completely normal. I'm fine.

281
00:19:08,436 --> 00:19:10,181
"Fine"? I know...

282
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:12,315
...you secretly clean up
the whole place every night.

283
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,904
I'm not that oblivious.

284
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,415
-Why don't you...
-No.

285
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:18,482
Why not?

286
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,970
I just don't like it.

287
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,369
Mr. Jang.

288
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,369
An insect.

289
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:32,269
An insect at my place? No way.

290
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,137
A huge one is crawling to you.

291
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,315
Gosh! Catch it!

292
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:39,615
Catch it!

293
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:40,970
You're definitely not fine.

294
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:48,215
Anyway, I don't care if you're a doctor.

295
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:51,204
No one else can stay here.

296
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,004
Why...

297
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,737
...no one else?

298
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:58,770
-What?
-Is it...

299
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,648
...because you want to stay...

300
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:04,970
...with me alone?

301
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,348
-Pervert.
-No.

302
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,503
What are you talking about?

303
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:11,081
That's not it.

304
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,181
Never.

305
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:13,981
You said...

306
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,515
...you'd make me fall...

307
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,104
You're accepted!

308
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,603
Yes!

309
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,037
You made the right choice.

310
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,749
You won't regret it, friend.

311
00:20:26,837 --> 00:20:28,914
"Friend"?

312
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,970
But you can't stay here,

313
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,970
understand?

314
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,948
I mean...

315
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,637
There are no vacant rooms anymore.

316
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:43,669
I just want counseling.

317
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,236
Sure.

318
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:48,236
I'm rather picky.
I don't sleep just anywhere.

319
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,837
Picky?

320
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,604
What should I do with him?

321
00:21:05,036 --> 00:21:07,482
So you got kicked out?

322
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,981
You haven't eaten anything all day?

323
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,215
I'm just glad I'm still alive.

324
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,782
They don't even watch a lot of movies.
Why that one, of all movies?

325
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,204
The one with rice balls?

326
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,181
In the end, you got
caught by your parents.

327
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,302
Yes.

328
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,637
They watched it with their students.

329
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:24,103
So what are you going to do now?

330
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,749
I'd love to help you,

331
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,749
but as you know,

332
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,048
my apartment is tiny.

333
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,815
-Don't worry.
-Still,

334
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,404
I feel bad.

335
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,382
It's okay.

336
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,548
I'll be quiet.

337
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:39,669
What?

338
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,936
Is that how you interpreted it?

339
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,536
Are you crazy?

340
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,070
You want me to get kicked out too?
Forget it.

341
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,482
Is this it? Are you sure
it's not a prison cell?

342
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,804
If you don't like it, find another place.

343
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,336
No. I love it.

344
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,248
The bathroom is
at the end of the corridor.

345
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:06,782
But no one can see you here,

346
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,037
so use it only at night.

347
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:10,604
-Do you understand?
-Don't worry.

348
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:12,112
I'm good at holding my pee.

349
00:22:13,203 --> 00:22:14,203
Be careful.

350
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,236
That means, "Sorry".

351
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:24,670
Look how big that face is.

352
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,003
What's that?

353
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:36,636
Why are you still here?

354
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:39,137
Oh, it's getting late.

355
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:42,369
You took such a long shower.

356
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,115
I waited so that I could say goodbye.

357
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:46,749
You don't have to do that.

358
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,338
Just leave.

359
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,837
I couldn't leave without saying goodbye.

360
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:58,003
Can I use the bathroom?

361
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,369
Did I eat something bad?

362
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:04,127
Gosh.

363
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,804
Go home...

364
00:23:09,969 --> 00:23:11,749
You must be hungry.

365
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,548
Food is ready.

366
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:14,769
No thanks.

367
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,904
I don't have much of an appetite.

368
00:23:25,703 --> 00:23:27,924
Can I just throw it away?

369
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:31,281
Wait. What's really going on?

370
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,281
-What do you mean?
-Why are you here?

371
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:34,548
Like I said,

372
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:36,203
I'm his doctor.

373
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,548
How did you know I was here?

374
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:41,370
Did you meet Ms. Kwon?

375
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:44,236
Do you still think...

376
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:46,705
...this is the right thing to do?

377
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,582
You can't even tell your family.

378
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,271
What are you doing here?

379
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,071
I have my reasons.

380
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,169
If this is for O Dol,

381
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:01,137
couldn't you look for other ways?

382
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:05,970
Sometimes, it's better to lie...

383
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,460
...than to tell the truth.

384
00:24:10,336 --> 00:24:13,670
I don't want O Dol to regret like me.

385
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,002
What if...

386
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:18,281
...you regret?

387
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,280
No.

388
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,160
I won't.

389
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,737
Even if I do,

390
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,670
I will deal with it.

391
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:33,633
Let me help you.

392
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:35,648
It would be better...

393
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:38,937
...than struggling alone.

394
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:54,248
Gosh.

395
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,069
It hurts.

396
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,868
Who are you?

397
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,636
Thank you, Dong Hyeon.

398
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,822
Jae Min, you can stay as long as you want.

399
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:35,936
Gosh, where are my bunny slippers?

400
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:40,236
That jerk!

401
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:44,569
Give me my slippers!

402
00:25:48,736 --> 00:25:51,270
Oh, my. I must've fallen asleep.

403
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:52,682
What...

404
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,215
What a nice couch. I usually have
trouble sleeping in new places.

405
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,837
My slippers... You're wearing
my slippers on my couch...

406
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:01,669
Do you know... I will...

407
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,003
This?

408
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:07,104
Come on, don't be like that.
Let's share like good buddies.

409
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:13,770
Get out.

410
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,603
Get out of my house right now!

411
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,704
-Good morning.
-Good morning?

412
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,496
Organic?

413
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,236
It's you, isn't it?

414
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:49,603
Why on earth did you send a doctor?

415
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,937
Why are you suddenly doing this to me?

416
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:57,203
Is that the only reason
you came so early in the morning?

417
00:26:59,069 --> 00:27:00,469
The only reason?

418
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,503
I'm not surprised.

419
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,569
Everything will seem like that to you.

420
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:09,671
Petty, bothersome, and not a big deal.

421
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,682
Do you think doing this
will fix my mysophobia?

422
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,837
No.

423
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:17,069
I'm not thinking of fixing it,
and I won't. Do you understand?

424
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,304
You will say that for now.

425
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,804
But in the end...

426
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,171
...you will end up thanking me.

427
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,537
Thanking you?

428
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,737
You are exactly the same.

429
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,670
From when you sent me
to the States back then.

430
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,203
-You haven't changed a bit.
-I know.

431
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,469
I have always tried to make...

432
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:47,102
...the right decision.

433
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,603
Even now.

434
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:52,537
If I didn't send you
to the States back then...

435
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:55,102
...living the way you live currently...

436
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,204
...would be impossible.

437
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:08,737
This place is so awesome.

438
00:28:10,136 --> 00:28:13,637
Looking at you here, you seem
prettier and much cooler too.

439
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:16,870
You're so sweet with your words.

440
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:20,682
Right. O Sol, I have a favor to ask you.

441
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,803
Yes?

442
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,805
If I tell him to go,
he will never listen to me.

443
00:28:26,903 --> 00:28:29,148
Can you ask him instead of me?

444
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:30,502
That he must go here.

445
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:33,749
(Invitation to Book Publishing Event)

446
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,970
"Kim Hye Won"? Anchor Kim Hye Won
published a book?

447
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:39,070
I really like her too.

448
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,070
Do you know her well too?

449
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:43,348
Of course I do.

450
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:46,569
I'm thinking of her
as my future daughter-in-law.

451
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:49,470
Oh, your daughter-in-law?

452
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,204
Don't Seon Gyeol and Kim Hye Won
look so good together?

453
00:28:54,136 --> 00:28:55,370
They really do.

454
00:28:56,036 --> 00:28:58,315
They both have great looks.

455
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,870
I really hope it goes well
between Seon Gyeol...

456
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:02,703
...and Anchor Kim Hye Won.

457
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,214
I met her at the beauty salon,
and it seems that she still has...

458
00:29:07,303 --> 00:29:09,837
...feelings for Seon Gyeol!

459
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:17,448
Can you please ask him
that he must go to this event?

460
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,736
He should go and apologize
for last time too.

461
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:24,870
Of course. I will tell him.

462
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,571
-Cognitive behavioral therapy?
-Yes.

463
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:36,815
After exposing him intentionally to
something that stimulates his OCD,

464
00:29:36,903 --> 00:29:39,648
we're trying to prevent him
from avoiding or trying to run away,

465
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,336
from a situation
which makes him anxious.

466
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:45,548
Simply put, we're making him practice.

467
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:48,081
So he can be exposed naturally
to a casual environment.

468
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:49,970
And we're hoping you can help with that.

469
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:52,749
Don't Seon Gyeol and Kim Hye Won
look so good together?

470
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:55,304
I really hope it goes well
between Seon Gyeol...

471
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,071
...and Anchor Kim Hye Won.

472
00:29:57,203 --> 00:30:00,270
After a series of CBT and counseling...

473
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,304
Why? Is something wrong?

474
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,570
What?

475
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:11,805
Your face kept looking
perplexed from a while ago.

476
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,003
No. Nothing is wrong.

477
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,070
Anyway, I just have to behave
the same way as now, right?

478
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,637
Yes.

479
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:33,103
You got off work now? You're late.

480
00:30:45,002 --> 00:30:48,669
Don't you remember me telling you
not to touch my stuff?

481
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:51,670
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,070
I'm the one who read this.

483
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,170
Right. When shall we begin our therapy?

484
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,636
Mr. Jang.

485
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:28,736
Here you go.

486
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:36,704
I heard from your mother earlier today...

487
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,204
...that you just left last time
without saying anything.

488
00:31:40,369 --> 00:31:41,436
Throw it away.

489
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:43,670
I don't have time to go
to events like this.

490
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,648
Why don't you just go?

491
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:48,936
-You should apologize...
-Ms. Gil.

492
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:51,104
You said my mother told you everything.

493
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:52,582
You must know well then.

494
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,171
That this isn't just an invitation
to a book publishing event.

495
00:31:57,436 --> 00:32:01,136
Do you really wish me to go to this event?

496
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,148
If I go and meet with
Anchor Kim Hye Won...

497
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,369
...and have dinner with her and
go on a date, does that...

498
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:11,870
...really mean nothing to you?

499
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,736
I already told you.

500
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,836
I have no feelings for you.

501
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,737
I'll leave this here then.

502
00:32:53,969 --> 00:32:56,670
You heard everything in there, didn't you?

503
00:32:57,937 --> 00:32:59,871
Oh, about the invitation?

504
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,703
That's a nice house,
but it's not soundproof.

505
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,037
I guess they built it hastily.

506
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:13,438
You even lied to me about going to Busan.

507
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:16,003
You've become a better liar.

508
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:19,003
I thought the person you liked...

509
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,503
...was Jang Seon Gyeol.

510
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:29,003
I read this in a book.

511
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,637
Everyone tends to speak
and act in a way...

512
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:37,136
...that's advantageous to them.

513
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,970
Do you call that an advantage?

514
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,570
To me, it seemed disadvantageous.

515
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:58,103
Shall we walk?

516
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,770
I'll be late today.

517
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:28,437
I have to go to a book publishing event.

518
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:32,203
Okay. Have a nice day.

519

I really love your book.

520

Excuse me.

The event is over now.

523
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,803

...hate crowds.

525
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,235
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:28,704
Would he be with her now?

527
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,937
She would've been impressed
even if he hadn't dressed up.

528
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,203
What am I saying now?

529
00:35:43,703 --> 00:35:45,970
I think it's for the best.

530
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,836
But why am I so upset?

531
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,471
Why am I this upset?

532
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:02,615
...I was so torn as to whether or not...

533
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,204
I should invite you.

534
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,271
Now, I'm so glad...

535
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,237
...I mustered up the courage
to invite you.

536
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,536
About that day...

537
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,070
...I'm sorry I left like that.

538
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:19,914
That was extremely rude.

539
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:22,081
You can apologize later on.

540
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:23,582
You can just be good to me from now on.

541
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,670
No.

542
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:28,171
This isn't about apologizing.
I have something to tell you.

543
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,014
I heard that you like me.

544
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:34,482
I'm grateful, but I have
no interest in you.

545
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,737
And I won't develop...

546
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:38,936
...any feelings for you.

547
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:40,169
I beg your pardon?

548
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:44,236
It doesn't mean you're not
attractive or good enough for me.

549
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,271
It's just because I like someone else.

550
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,770
To tell you the truth,

551
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,970
I'm a little heartbroken these days
because of my crush.

552
00:36:55,806 --> 00:36:57,981
There was a time
when I wanted to use you...

553
00:36:58,069 --> 00:37:00,970
...just to hurt her.

554
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,937
I guess...

555
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,636
...I'm such a loser after all.

556
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:11,303
So...

557
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,571
...you're rejecting me, then.

558
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:15,803
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,970
Can you please stop apologizing?

560
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,237
I'm embarrassed.

561
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:29,669

that fussy man would date.

00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:16,603
Oh, that I looked for you?

664
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:20,203
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not a stalker.

665
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:24,371
I'm not talking about that.

666
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,870
She said you felt really
bad about something.

667
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:31,304
Do you owe me an apology for something?

668
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:35,970
Oh, that?

669
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,903
No.

670
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:41,035
Look at you.

671
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,903
It must be true.

672
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,971
You do feel bad about something.

673
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:48,670
You must be hiding something from me.

674
00:42:48,837 --> 00:42:49,815
What is it?

675
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:52,771
Well, "hiding" isn't
really the right word.

676
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,103
Is it something difficult to say?

677
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:06,070
Then you don't need to tell me.

678
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:08,970
I don't know what you feel bad about.

679
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:13,504
But frankly, there are more things
I should thank you for.

680
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:25,436
I know you brought me out intentionally.

681
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,738
I was so upset.

682
00:43:28,169 --> 00:43:31,269
But spending time with you
like this made me feel better.

683
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,837
Come to think of it,

684
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:39,836
you're like this yogurt.

685
00:43:40,036 --> 00:43:42,203
Just like this yogurt,
you give me consolation...

686
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,070
...whenever I need it.

687
00:43:47,436 --> 00:43:48,970
You see, if...

688
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,503
What if I was that person?

689
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,770
That person who brings you solace...

690
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,403
...every year.

691
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:01,269
Gosh.

692
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:04,402
Is that Mr. Jang's car?

693
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:08,604
Great timing.

694
00:44:08,903 --> 00:44:09,936
What did you say?

695
00:44:10,503 --> 00:44:11,937
It was nothing.

696
00:44:12,102 --> 00:44:13,269
Don't mind me.

697
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,682
Let's go.

698
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,548
You said something.

699
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:18,849
-What was it?
-Nothing. I'm just sleepy.

700
00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:20,849
Why are you sleepy at this hour?

701
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:23,037
It was really nothing.

702
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,738
I'm so childish. What am I doing now?

703
00:44:36,803 --> 00:44:39,103
Ta-da. They look great, don't they?

704
00:44:40,236 --> 00:44:43,315
O Sol had to run as fast
as Usain Bolt today...

705
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,281
...to get these lobsters.

706
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:48,070
It smells bad. Why did you have to...

707
00:44:49,273 --> 00:44:50,218
-O Sol.
-Yes?

708
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,773
-Prepare the tools.
-Sure.

709
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:57,307
Why would you eat them? There will
be so much garbage afterward.

710
00:44:58,773 --> 00:44:59,840
Here you go.

711
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:01,485
Let me wipe the belly first.

712
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,040
-It must be ticklish.
-Is that how you do it?

713
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,041
You have to wipe them first.

714
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,452
It tastes good.

715
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,007
-You like it?
-I love it.

716
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:14,007
Really?

717
00:45:17,807 --> 00:45:20,807
-Where is butter?
-Butter?

718
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:24,085
-Kim Hye Won is dating the CEO...
-Mr. Jang.

719
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,273
...of a cleaning company.

720
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:27,585
Where is the butter in the fridge?

721
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:28,973
-What?
-Butter.

722
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,707
Butter.

723
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:34,907
It's probably on the top shelf.

724
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:36,707
-Okay.
-Wait.

725
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:40,352
Did you read any articles...

726
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,851
-...today...
-O Sol.

727
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,951
-Can you get me some butter?
-Just a second.

728
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,506
Top shelf, right?

729
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:50,807
We're almost all ready.

730
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:53,585
It's ready to go into the oven.
We can eat soon.

731
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:55,873
I don't want any lobsters.

732
00:45:56,406 --> 00:45:59,606
You two enjoy. I hate all crustaceans.

733
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:06,840
He doesn't want them.

734
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:09,873
Good. We have only two anyway.

735
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:13,106
-We'll eat everything.
-Okay.

736
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:16,539
Wait. I can't let them have all the fun.

737
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,840
Well... It would be...

738
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,141
...rude of me to refuse the food...

739
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:23,189
-Just to be polite...
-Is there wine?

740
00:46:23,278 --> 00:46:24,680
I'm sure there is. He has everything.

741
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:26,573
It was so hard to get these.

742
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:29,639
What about this?

743
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:36,740
Gosh. That little...

744
00:46:42,273 --> 00:46:44,619
-Ta-da. They look great.
-They look so tasty.

745
00:46:44,707 --> 00:46:47,051
-They came out great.
-They're nice and red.

746
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,406
We did a good job.

747
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,807
I want some too.

748
00:46:58,239 --> 00:46:59,385
I can't have any?

749
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:02,074
You can. I've been waiting for you.
Eat a lot.

750
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:03,673
Take the big one.

751
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,374
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

752
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:12,807
It's so tasty.

753
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:15,707
I ran so fast, didn't I?

754
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,341
You were almost flying.

755
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,440
-I can't believe we ran into...
-It's too tough.

756
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,285
It's really tough.

757
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,051
Is it from China?

758
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:28,107
Why don't we open the wine now?

759
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:30,740
How do you open it? It's not working.

760
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:32,851
Do we have an opener?

761
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:34,619
You need an opener?

762
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:37,452
I think we used it once.
Let me check my room.

763
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,673
No. I'll go.

764
00:47:40,506 --> 00:47:41,873
Keep eating.

765
00:47:46,939 --> 00:47:49,406
-Well... I want some water.
-Wait.

766
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:52,941
Ms. Gil.

767
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:59,173
Did you read the articles today?

768
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:02,640
What articles?

769
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,851
That you and Kim Hye Won are dating?

770
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:09,039
Well...

771
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:13,151
The thing is, it's not true.

772
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,439
Bring her here sometime.

773
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:18,539
I'm a huge fan.

774
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,440
Can I get an autograph?

775
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:22,940
Would it make her uncomfortable?

776
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:24,807
All right.

777
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:26,840
I will.

778
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,907
I found the opener.

779
00:48:57,939 --> 00:49:00,072
The articles are not true.

780
00:49:00,473 --> 00:49:02,840
I turned her down.

781
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,406
I told her I like someone else.

782
00:49:16,773 --> 00:49:18,274
You have no idea how I feel.

783
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:23,907
You have no idea how I feel.

784
00:49:33,906 --> 00:49:35,240
-Mr. Jang.
-Yes?

785
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:38,373
Is there more kitchen detergent?

786
00:49:38,473 --> 00:49:39,418
The bottle is empty.

787
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:42,606
Kitchen detergent...
It's in the utility room.

788
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,340
Okay.

789
00:49:44,707 --> 00:49:46,974
-Ms. Gil.
-Yes?

790
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,473
Well...

791
00:49:50,707 --> 00:49:52,148
Did you see your phone?

792
00:49:52,558 --> 00:49:53,429
My phone?

793
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,006
I'm charging it in my room right now.

794
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,884
-Why?
-I mean my phone.

795
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:03,439
I can't find it.

796
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:06,740
There it is. I found it.

797
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,406
You know where the utility room is?
It's in the corner...

798
00:50:11,773 --> 00:50:14,652
You'll find more kitchen detergent there.

799
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,773
Okay.

800
00:50:24,673 --> 00:50:27,073
It's in her room. Her room.

805

What are you doing in my room?

806
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,039
Well...

807

You have no idea how I feel.

808
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,539
You sent it to the wrong person.

809
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:53,874
No.

810
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:56,907
I sent it to you.

811
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:02,673
The articles are not true.

812
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:05,906
I asked for a correction too.

813
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:08,907
I also made myself clear...

814
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,074
...to Hye Won.

815
00:52:12,373 --> 00:52:15,007
Why are you telling me this?

816
00:52:15,406 --> 00:52:16,573
I didn't want it...

817
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,473
...to bother you.

818
00:52:20,106 --> 00:52:21,173
No.

819
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,273
It was...

820
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,874
...bothering me.

821
00:52:29,073 --> 00:52:30,440
You are...

822
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:33,340
...the one I like.

823
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,340
-I told you I didn't have...
-I don't care.

824
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,574
You don't have to go out with me.

825
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:45,873
I just...

826
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,607
...wanted to tell you...

827
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,507
...how I feel.

00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:16,473
(CEO of Cleaning Fairy is AG
Group Chairman's Grandson)

831
00:53:36,173 --> 00:53:38,385
How did you come in here?

832
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:40,673
I told them I'm your doctor,
and they let me in right away.

833
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,552
Why did you leave yesterday
without saying goodbye?

834
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,751
You told me not to.

835
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,039
So I just left.

836
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,985
You're very obedient.

837
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:51,218
Of course.

838
00:53:51,306 --> 00:53:54,174
It is my duty to listen
carefully to my patient.

839
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:59,207
Now, since we've gotten
acquainted with each other,

840
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:01,107
can we begin our therapy?

841
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:04,085
It's time you stop trying
to avoid it by now.

842
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:05,707
I'll be honest with you.

843
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:08,719
I don't know how much
my grandpa has paid you for this,

844
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:10,784
but I won't receive your therapy.

845
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,039
So...

846
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,719
...let's not waste our time.

847
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,408
Why not?

848
00:54:15,707 --> 00:54:18,141
You told me you would
receive it last time.

849
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:20,372
Back then, I had no choice...

850
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:23,706
Anyway,

851
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:27,318
I'll tell him you did your job regardless,

852
00:54:27,406 --> 00:54:29,140
so if it's about the money, don't worry.

853
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,173
Besides money,

854
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:35,807
you may have another objective, right?

855
00:54:44,673 --> 00:54:47,140
Come to think of it, you do resemble him.

856
00:54:47,573 --> 00:54:49,107
Your grandfather.

857
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:52,573
Is that why you push each other apart?

858
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:57,641
Since magnetic like poles always
tend to repel each other.

859
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:03,340
Who are you to say that?

860
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,907
I don't know how distinguished
you are as a doctor,

861
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:09,206
but I have no intent of changing
or fixing my disease.

862
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,585
So stop interfering with my life.

863
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:13,207
I don't want to either.

864
00:55:13,773 --> 00:55:15,607
But I'm in a bit of a pickle now.

865
00:55:16,473 --> 00:55:18,807
Now, I want to interfere. That's too bad.

866
00:55:21,073 --> 00:55:24,240
Why don't we skip the chitchat and now...

867
00:55:24,673 --> 00:55:26,840
...reach an understanding,
like grown-ups do.

868
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,085
-An understanding?
-I know...

869
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:31,385
...you are probably sick of
seeing me inside your home.

870
00:55:31,473 --> 00:55:33,673
But I must fix you.

871
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:37,240
If you don't want to be trapped
with me in that home forever,

872
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,274
why don't we start our counseling?

873
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:41,240
If it still doesn't work,

874
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:43,652
I'll give up and leave.

875
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,807
What do you think?

876
00:55:45,373 --> 00:55:47,406
Isn't it a tempting deal?

877
00:55:48,939 --> 00:55:51,907
You get off work at 6 and come home at 7.

878
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:54,440
I'll be waiting for you,
dressed up nicely.

879
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,040
Did your talk go well?

880
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,506
How is O Sol doing?

881
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,207
Whose side are you on, Ms. Kwon?

882
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:22,485
What do you mean?

883
00:56:22,573 --> 00:56:25,407
I usually don't like
choosing sides and all,

884
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:28,174
but I'm not sure if
you're a friend or a foe.

885
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:44,784
-O Sol!
-O Sol!

886
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:45,872
My goodness.

887
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,318
It is her. It really is O Sol.

888
00:56:52,406 --> 00:56:54,051
How long has it been?
You haven't even called.

889
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:55,139
How could you?

890
00:56:55,656 --> 00:56:56,540
How have you been?

891
00:56:56,629 --> 00:56:59,018
O Sol, what on earth is going on?

892
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:01,040
I just missed you guys.

893
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,352
It's been a long time.

894
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,907
I know. It's been so long.

895
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,207
Has Ms. Gil gone somewhere?

896
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,340
I sent her out to get some fresh air.

897
00:57:15,573 --> 00:57:17,274
If someone else...

898
00:57:17,773 --> 00:57:20,240
Especially someone you care about
is next to you,

899
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,707
it would be difficult to answer honestly.

900
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:24,585
Gosh.

901
00:57:24,673 --> 00:57:26,673
There's no need to worry about me.

902
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:29,773
Well then, why don't we start?

903
00:57:29,972 --> 00:57:31,285
Before I change my mind.

904
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:32,951
If you sit there with your arms folded,

905
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:35,339
like someone who has some serious issues,

906
00:57:35,906 --> 00:57:37,685
I don't know what I should ask.

907
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:40,185
Isn't it your job to make
any type of patient...

908
00:57:40,273 --> 00:57:41,640
...talk to you?

909
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,806
If you can't, it means you're incompetent.

910
00:57:46,373 --> 00:57:47,940
If you state it like that,

911
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,274
okay then, let's begin.

912
00:57:50,573 --> 00:57:52,074
Since I'm competent,

913
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,372
let's give it a try.

914
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,340
Honestly, I was surprised.

915
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:01,085
You invited someone into
your most personal space...

916
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:02,774
...that you would want to protect.

917
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:06,118
You can consider yourself
almost totally cured...

918
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:07,941
...but unfortunately...

919
00:58:09,373 --> 00:58:10,951
...that's only applicable to O Sol.

920
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:12,072
Before that,

921
00:58:12,506 --> 00:58:13,873
let me ask you something.

922
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:19,151
What is your real purpose for coming here?

923
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:21,173
By purpose, what do you mean?

924
00:58:21,273 --> 00:58:24,207
I saw you telling O Sol
how you felt about her.

925
00:58:24,373 --> 00:58:27,406
Why? Were you afraid I might take away...

926
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:29,640
...someone you liked?

927
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,840
Is that why you're here?

928
00:58:33,106 --> 00:58:34,707
Since you saw, you must know then.

929
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,607
That I was...

930
00:58:37,106 --> 00:58:38,773
...dumped by her that day.

931
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,452
You were dumped?

932
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,007
If you're finished asking,

933
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:46,373
shall we begin again?

934
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:52,607
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

935
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,607
The counseling session is over.
You can come home now.

936
00:58:58,972 --> 00:59:01,206
I'm sorry, but let's wrap up here.

937
00:59:01,306 --> 00:59:02,452
I have to go home now.

938
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,840
Why? How could you go home so early?

939
00:59:04,939 --> 00:59:06,118
You should stay longer.

940
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:08,118
Let's go karaoke and
have some hangover soup.

941
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:09,385
Hang out with us a little more.

942
00:59:09,473 --> 00:59:11,452
This is upsetting, O Sol.

943
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,085
It's been so long since
we all gathered together.

944
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:14,719
No, let's call it a day.

945
00:59:14,807 --> 00:59:15,874
We can meet again next time.

946
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,773
Right. We can meet next time.

947
00:59:20,106 --> 00:59:22,373
Did you have fun with your friends?

948
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:23,640
Yes.

949
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:26,107
Where is Mr. Jang?

950
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,141
I'm sorry. I was at a BBQ restaurant,
and I might smell.

951
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,440
I'll go wash up.

952
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,573
No.

953
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:41,652
Take your time.

954
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,641
Take your time, and don't worry about it.

955
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:54,252
Your counseling was effective.

956
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,674
I told you I was talented.

957
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:01,840
Yes, Mr. Gil.

958
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:04,840
What?

959
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:06,707
My girlfriend?

960
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:08,106
I don't have a girlfriend.

961
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:09,884
-Let go!
-Tell me.

962
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:12,005
Tell me right now!

963
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:13,285
That hurts!

964
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:15,051
What is wrong with this lady?

965
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:17,452
Tell him to come. Where is he?
Tell him to come now!

966
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,441
Where is Choi?

967
01:00:19,673 --> 01:00:22,185
Where is he? Tell me where he is!

968
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:24,218
Did you hear that?
She has totally gone mad.

969
01:00:24,306 --> 01:00:25,218
Hurry up.

970
01:00:25,306 --> 01:00:28,585
Just get over here.
Things are getting out of control.

971
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:30,418
-Hurry up...
-Did you...

972
01:00:30,506 --> 01:00:32,806
...just talk with Choi on the phone?

973
01:00:33,406 --> 01:00:36,107
Are you the one who was hiding Choi?

974
01:00:36,373 --> 01:00:37,985
No, it wasn't me.

975
01:00:38,073 --> 01:00:39,185
He's on his way now.

976
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:40,874
No!

977
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:42,573
Let go of me.

978
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,884
-Let go!
-Do something!

979
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:46,585
Call Choi again!

980
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:49,751
Do not hide Choi from me.

981
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,707
Don't ever hide him from me.

982
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:56,173
Hold on.

983
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,252
What? What's the matter?

984
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,941
I'll tell you later.

985
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:01,573
Later.

986
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,207
Why is he leaving so urgently?

987
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,473
Is something wrong at home?

988
01:01:15,373 --> 01:01:17,285
Did Mr. Choi leave?

989
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,840
Yes. He...

990
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:21,418
Something urgent suddenly came up.

991
01:01:21,506 --> 01:01:23,218
Why? Do you need anything?

992
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:24,407
No.

993
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,107
Did you have plans tonight?

994
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:28,552
Did you meet someone?

995
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,985
I met Yeong Sik and the other guys.

996
01:01:31,073 --> 01:01:32,173
I see.

997
01:01:33,473 --> 01:01:35,418
Did you tell them you're staying here?

998
01:01:35,506 --> 01:01:39,207
No. It felt a bit
inappropriate to tell them.

999
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:43,340
It must've been a long time since you met.

1000
01:01:43,773 --> 01:01:45,985
You came home early.
You should've talked more...

1001
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:48,140
and took your time hanging out with them.

1002
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,073
No, I was just concerned...

1003
01:01:53,939 --> 01:01:55,873
You were concerned? About me?

1004
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,018
No. I didn't mean you.

1005
01:01:58,106 --> 01:02:00,485
Well... Since you two aren't...

1006
01:02:00,573 --> 01:02:03,151
...exactly on good terms
with each other...

1007
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:06,539
...I was concerned whether you
might get into a fight...

1008
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,673
...and...

1009
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,906
...I reek of meat right now.

1010
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:14,439
I should take a shower and change.

1011
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,540
Something feels so awkward suddenly.

1012
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:37,373
Get a grip of yourself.

1013
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:38,673
Get a grip.

1014
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:43,640
Since you saw, you must know then.

1015
01:02:44,273 --> 01:02:45,540
That I was...

1016
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:47,706
...dumped by her that day.

1017
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:03,939
My gosh.

1018
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,518
You already washed up?

1019
01:03:07,606 --> 01:03:09,407
Yes, well...

1020
01:03:09,707 --> 01:03:12,585
Sir, why are you still awake?

1021
01:03:12,673 --> 01:03:15,285
Oh, I just wanted to drink something.

1022
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:18,707
I'm thirsty too. Maybe it's
because I just took a shower.

1023
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:21,273
-I want some water as well.
-I want to drink water too.

1024
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,640
You go ahead.

1025
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:24,840
Okay.

1026
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:48,340
Wait!

1027
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:51,473
What?

1028
01:03:53,373 --> 01:03:56,174
This... You can't drink it.

1029
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,374
Are you okay? Isn't your throat burning?

1030
01:04:00,906 --> 01:04:02,006
Is it...

1031
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:05,352
It's a very strong wine.

1032
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,707
It's bush clover...

1033
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:08,339
Be quiet.

1034
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:10,006
My gosh.

1035
01:04:10,206 --> 01:04:12,240
Are you all right?

1036
01:04:12,906 --> 01:04:15,206
O Sol, isn't it hot in here?

1037
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:18,039
What? Well...

1038
01:04:18,273 --> 01:04:20,473
It's hot. It's so hot in here.

1039
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:25,907
Well, this is...

1040
01:04:26,473 --> 01:04:29,873
-I'm thirsty.
-Mr. Jang, that's not water.

1041
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:31,506
Don't drink it, please.

1042
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:37,440
-Go in. We're almost there.
-Give me...

1043
01:04:37,872 --> 01:04:40,172
Gosh, why is he so heavy?

1044
01:04:40,573 --> 01:04:42,007
That's real strong alcohol.

1045
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:43,740
Goodness.

1046
01:04:43,872 --> 01:04:45,239
Just go up this step, please.

1047
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,807
There, great. You're doing well.

1048
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,373
Gosh.

1049
01:05:33,773 --> 01:05:34,873
I'm sorry...

1050
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:41,040
...for not knowing how you felt.

1051
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:47,807
I mean,

1052
01:05:48,906 --> 01:05:50,173
for pretending not to know.

1053
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,306
You've fallen for me, right?

1054
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,918
Let's date, O Sol.

1055
01:06:36,006 --> 01:06:37,085
Trust me.

1056
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:40,318
I feel like I can go
anywhere if it's with you.

1057
01:06:40,406 --> 01:06:42,518
Seon Gyeol is seeing someone now?

1058
01:06:42,606 --> 01:06:45,040
O Sol. Seon Gyeol likes her.

1059
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:47,218
Are you saying Ms. Gil's mother...

1060
01:06:47,306 --> 01:06:49,240
...was one of the victims?

1061
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,619
Mr. Jang, is something wrong? Mr. Jang.

1062
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,408
All of you, get out. Get out this instant!

1063
01:06:54,872 --> 01:06:57,239
Don't go anywhere. You have
to stay right by my side.

1064
01:06:57,406 --> 01:06:58,506
I will.

1065
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,241
I won't go anywhere.

1066
01:07:03,173 --> 01:07:04,273
What?

1067
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,840
(J Lives with a Guy,
Was Kim Hye Won a Decoy?)

1068
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:13,007
(We confirmed that the young
entrepreneur, J, lives with a man.)

1069
01:07:14,606 --> 01:07:15,673
This is...

1070
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:19,139
Crazy idiots!

1071
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,874
They call this an article?

1072
01:07:21,106 --> 01:07:22,406
It's ridiculous.

1073
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:23,874
Why? What is it?

1074
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,873
This is me.

1075
01:07:28,972 --> 01:07:30,673
What? We're dating?

1076
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:33,840
I must say, we look cute together.

1077
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,784
-How about...
-You're crazy too.

1078
01:07:36,872 --> 01:07:38,806
-We start seeing each other?
-Gosh, you startled me.

1079
01:07:39,573 --> 01:07:42,174
-You want to get hit in the face?
-Hit me, please.

1080
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:44,607
Do you have a death wish?

1081
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:46,973
-Kill me, please.
-Get lost.

1082
01:07:47,487 --> 01:07:48,567
Get lost. Gosh!

1083
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:07,083
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
