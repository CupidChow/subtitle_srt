1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,067
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,567
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,142
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,158
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,964
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,824
What's all that fuss about?

8
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:39,602
What do you think?
They're Cleaning Fairies.

9
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,669
Cleaning Fairies?

10
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:43,636
Well, you know.
They're all over social media these days.

11
00:00:43,724 --> 00:00:45,391
It's a cleaning service
that hires super-hot guys.

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,858
Come over here!

13
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,102
No matter how desperate you are for money,

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,703
can you please screen out
the weird tenants?

15
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,835
Whatever. This is your fault,
so you should be responsible.

16
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,190
I've told Mr. Park, so get going.

17
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,402
3,500 dollars?

18
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,984
If you don't send me the money this week,

19
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:03,823
I'll hire a lawyer and file a suit.

20
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:07,463
It's wrong to look down on others
just because you're rich.

21
00:01:07,557 --> 00:01:10,124
Fine, I'll give you the money.
That darn 3,500 dollars.

22
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,124
The fitness test has been completed.

23
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,735
Today, we'll proceed with the orientation.

24
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,336
These are our new hires.

25
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:20,102
-3,500 dollars?
-So you're saying that guy...

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,302
...is the CEO of Cleaning Fairy?

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,135
How could our paths cross again like this?

28
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:26,857
I have never seen anyone
like her in my entire life.

29
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,423
I have no idea
when she even washed her hair.

30
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,135
Does she have a hole on
her chin or something?

31
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:33,269
Why does she spill everything
she eats or drinks?

32
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:37,302
Mr. Jang, do you want
to go for one more drink?

33
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,991
Ms. Gil doesn't seem to like it.

34
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,768
I doubt a CEO will go out with you.

35
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,802
Did you ask him to act
as if he's your boyfriend?

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,636
I'm sorry. Let me borrow
it just this once.

37
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,236
Do you think an apology would do?

38
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,735
Why do I have to get roped into
your complicated love life...

39
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:54,490
...and go through all of this? Why?

40
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,668
Mr. Jang.

41
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,169
-Mr. Jang.
-Gross Gil?

42
00:01:58,257 --> 00:02:00,058
-Mr. Jang.
-Get lost!

43
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,269
Dr. Fore's student is in Korea?

44
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:05,158
Your condition seems to be getting worse.

45
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,703
Meeting him for a consultation
might be helpful.

46
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,402
What do you mean by
"dissociative disorder"?

47
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,302
You said that woman always
appears in front of your eyes.

48
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,258
She pops out all the time...

49
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,902
...and torments you, right?

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,985
Although it's not my field,
it's a condition in oriental medicine.

51
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:20,474
Love sickness.

52
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,935
It occurs when you're deeply in love.

53
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:24,502
By the way, have you met that girl?

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,890
You know, that girl who you
said changed your life.

55
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:32,868
Someone leaves yogurt on my mother's
death anniversary every year.

56
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,713
I have no idea who it is,

57
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,935
but this tiny bottle of yogurt
brings me solace.

58
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,069
I knew that he could be a weirdo,

59
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:42,369
but he's really unpredictable these days.

60
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:43,969
-No!
-I heard love makes...

61
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,758
...everyone go crazy.

62
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,657
What's the address of the place
Ms. Gil has gone to?

63
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:52,302
Send me the blacklist of
our clients right away.

64
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,523
You jerk.

65
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:56,023
Gil O Sol!

66
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:57,290
Mr. Jang.

67
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,169
You've been acting so strange these days.
Do you realize that?

68
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:04,758
Ms. Gil, can you give me your hand?
I just have to check something.

69
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:07,956
He said there's only one person
he can touch.

70
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:09,768
Gil O Sol was that person?

71
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,923
Did he just make a move on me?

72
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,802
Does he like me?

73
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,402
So, did he tell you how he feels?
Did he ask you out?

74
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,202
He didn't say anything like that.

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,902
You have to make things clear.

76
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,135
Don't become a total fool
like when Lee Do Jin used you.

77
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:24,956
That's why you should start dating too.

78
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:27,032
That is why I don't date.

79
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,416
I don't want to become a
laughing stock like you.

80
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,494
Well, Mr. Jang.

81
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,191
Do you have anything to say to me?

82
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,292
Well, what I'm asking is...

83
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,696
About...

84
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,965
...what happened yesterday.

85
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,358
We should talk about it.

86
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:03,909
I'm sorry,

87
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,591
but I'm not in the mood to talk about it.

88
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:11,842
Let's talk another time.

89
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:16,024
I'll get going.

90
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:19,869
Wait.

91
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:29,725
How could you always do whatever you want?

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,244
Regardless of your mood today...

93
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:39,672
...you could...

94
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,938
...at least say a few words
about our kiss last night.

95
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,211
What do you want to hear from me?

96
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:05,972
Why?

97
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,492
Were you expecting me
to ask you to be my girlfriend?

98
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:12,935
What did you say?

99
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:15,190
I'm sorry, but I have
no interest in dating.

100
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,691
Right now, I don't even
want to date anyone.

101
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,359
Is that enough of an answer for you?

102
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:42,291
Let's go.

103
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:19,606
That jerk.

104
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,226
He got me all confused.

105
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,837
I'm such an idiot.

106
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,613
Why did I want to impress him?

107
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,357
I even put on heels.

108
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,824
Gosh.

109
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:49,290
Darn it.

110
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:58,424
When I saw you in the morning,
I knew those would kill your feet.

111
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:02,982
What's that?

112
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,484
What did you buy?

113
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:05,896
Take it.

114
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:08,867
Shall I put it on you?

115
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,857
Running shoes suit you better than heels.

116
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:25,122
Anyway, it's better now, right?

117
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,142
A little bit, I guess.

118
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,221
I think it's helping,

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,227
but I'm not sure.

120
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,956
How come you're drinking alone?

121
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,899
Did something happen today?

122
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,166
No, nothing happened. I'm just...

123
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm asking because I'm just curious.

124
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:56,367
Can men hold hands with a girl...

125
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:57,645
...they're not interested in...

126
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,622
...and even kiss her?

127
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,600
He said he doesn't even
want to date anyone.

128
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:06,799
He got me all confused for no reason.

129
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:11,632
Right.

130
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,023
I did the same thing.

131
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:16,887
That kiss.

132
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,058
I didn't even like him.

133
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:26,233
And I did it first.

134
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
So are we really even now?

135
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:41,799
Did you just answer your own question?

136
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,833
I know, right?

137
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:49,443
I answered my own question.

138
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,029
Oh, right.

139
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:59,564
How's it going with your secret crush?

140
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,728
Have you even confessed?

141
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,514
Like you said...

142
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,114
...timing...

143
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,081
...is a tricky thing.

144
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,347
Have I told you that I was
an athlete back in school?

145
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,314
I was a hurdler.

146
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,115
You know hurdling, right?
Running and jumping over obstacles.

147
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:38,948
In hurdling, speed and timing are key.

148
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,480
But whenever I tried
to hit the perfect timing,

149
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,780
it never really worked.

150
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,354
While trying to calculate my strides,

151
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:53,315
I'd trip over my foot and fall.

152
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:58,314
I should've just jumped
when it felt right,

153
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,658
without thinking too much.

154
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,281
So what I'm trying to say is,

155
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,784
don't try to calculate and weigh things.

156
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,201
Just go ahead and tell her how you feel.

157
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,515
Pushing, pulling,

158
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:20,847
testing the waters, and
eventually hurting the person.

159
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,448
That's just so horrible.

160
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,280
Do you want one?

161
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:36,615
What do you want to hear from me?

162
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:39,814
Why? Were you expecting me
to ask you to be my girlfriend?

163
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:41,309
What did you just say?

164
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,534
I have no interest in dating.

165
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:47,014
Right now, I don't even
want to date anyone.

166
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:07,547
What time is the next meeting?

167
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:10,648
We can leave right after this meeting.

168
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:12,681
Ms. Gil.

169
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,587
Did you just get here?

170
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,006
Yes, hello.

171
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:32,690
Everyone's here.

172
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,746
O sole mio

173
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:37,706
Hello, sir.

174
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:38,733
Hi, O Sol.

175
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:44,512
Then I'll head in first.

176
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,697
O Sol, why are you going alone? Wait up.

177
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,276
Sir.

178
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:22,409
I was quite flustered that day,
so I forgot to say something.

179
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,034
What is it?

180
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,911
I, too, have no interest
in dating at the moment.

181
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,303
Especially with a guy like you.

182
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,177
What?

183
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:40,910
That kiss too. Let's just call it even.

184
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:42,725
I did it once, and you did it this time.

185
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,177
We each did it once,
so we're even now, right?

186
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,143
See you.

187
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,044
Compared to our competitors,
the number of our mobile app users...

188
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:57,276
...has been increasing substantially.

189
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,689
The number of users was
6,000 back in 2016,

190
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:04,121
but it's currently at 10,000.
It's been steadily increasing,

191
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,522
while our competitors like
Clean It All and All Cleaning,

192
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,574
-can't retain their app users.
-Gosh.

193
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,555
The customer demographic
analysis tells us...

194
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:14,155
...that those in their 30s take up
the majority, at 52 percent.

195
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,998
Those in their 40s take up 40 percent,

196
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:19,409
and teens and those in their 20s
together take up 12 percent.

197
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,476
How dare she.

198
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,710
Hey!

199
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,893
Well...

200
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,151
Oh, where did she go?

201
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,078
She was just there, giving me...

202
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,871
...this...

203
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,008
Sir.

204
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,644
I'm sorry. I must've been mistaken.

205
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,376
Please continue.

206
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:48,419
Sure, I'll continue the presentation.

207
00:15:48,508 --> 00:15:50,712
Customers in their 30s are highly
adaptable to mobile applications,

208
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:54,299
so they use our app very actively
according to our analysis.

209
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,646
We could also see that newlywed couples...

210
00:15:56,734 --> 00:16:00,368
...who don't have time to clean
use our app a lot.

211
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,424
Yes, that's good, O Sol. Nicely done.

212
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,279
They say handsome men always
give women a hard time.

213
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,400
Teach him a serious lesson this time.

214
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,502
Yes, totally.

215
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,001
That jerk.

216
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,440
He led me on and got me all confused.
Aren't I right?

217
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:24,201
He picked the wrong target.

218
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:32,145
Hey, but what if...

219
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,393
...he was really having a bad day?

220
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:38,779
I mean, he looked upset.
He seemed a bit different.

221
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:41,334
But I made him stay for that chat.

222
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,811
Well, you know.
He could've said something...

223
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,706
...that he doesn't even mean
because he was upset about something else.

224
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:53,334
He might be regretting now.

225
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,612
Is that what you want to believe?

226
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,701
Hey, what are you talking about?

227
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:00,881
Then why would I be doing this?

228
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:05,928
There's no way I'd be interested
in a guy like my boss.

229
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,613
He's so inconsiderate.

230
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:10,335
He only cares about his own emotions.

231
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,235
And he changes his mind all the time.

232
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,346
So annoying.

233
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:16,201
My boss is such a jerk.

234
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,306
That's too bad.

235
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,905
You think I'm such a jerk.

236
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,037
Hello?

237
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:35,805
Are you still there?

238
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,977
What happened? Did she hang up?

239
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:44,527
Anyway, I guess she really liked him.

240
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:47,442
When she had a crush on Do Jin
for three years, she wasn't like this.

241
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:49,465
But now she's all worked up.

242
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,623
How cute.

243
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,476
"Rochester Clinic".

244
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,999
"Youngest psychiatrist"?

245
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,132
Gosh, I can't believe her.

246
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:14,776
I'm a jerk?

247
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:16,510
What nonsense.

248
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,543
Aren't I pretty decent?

249
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,514
I'm competent, tall, stylish...

250
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,907
My looks aren't that bad either.

251
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:29,598
Am I really that unattractive?

252
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:34,004
Fine, I admit I can be
a little unpredictable.

253
00:18:34,098 --> 00:18:36,365
But I've never acted...

254
00:18:36,464 --> 00:18:37,464
Mr. Jang.

255
00:18:37,553 --> 00:18:38,417
Yes?

256
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,098
Look over there.

257
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:51,082
Is it broken?

258
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,284
Yes. I guess so.

259
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:02,982
It's clean now.

260
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:07,914
Hello, Car Cleaning Service That
Brings Happiness.

261
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:09,594
Complex Two?

262
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,554
Of course! I can go there.

263
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:16,355
Yes. Thank you.

264
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:17,523
Hey, there.

265
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,243
What are you doing here?

266
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:25,043
-Who are you?
-I'm asking what you're doing here.

267
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,043
Please hold on.

268
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,134
Hello. Car Cleaning Service
That Brings Happiness.

269
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:32,717
I'll call you right back.

270
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,977
As you can see, I'm cleaning a car.

271
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,580
I mean,

272
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,714
I see that.

273
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:43,588
But this is our area.

274
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:44,921
Who allowed you to come here?

275
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,610
What do you mean, "this is your area"?

276
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,033
Anyone can come here and work.

277
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,272
Also, when I asked around,

278
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:55,454
they told me no one was
working in this area.

279
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,043
That's why I came in here.

280
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,987
What are you talking about?

281
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:00,885
We're starting here from today.

282
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:05,842
All right.

283
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,842
It's not like you can clean all
the cars here alone anyway.

284
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,839
I guess we can both work here.

285
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,049
I can't believe this man.

286
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:18,721
You can't work here. It's our area now.

287
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,209
You just leave. Let's not make a scene.

288
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:22,442
Do you understand?

289
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:25,209
What's this?

290
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:32,212
Why would you...

291
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,753
-Gosh.
-Those scum.

292
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,843
They're still doing that?

293
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,789
Do they work around here?

294
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,712
They show up here and
pick fights all the time.

295
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,448
They steal clients from other cleaners.

296
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,502
But the clients start
complaining soon after.

297
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:53,652
I can't stand them.

298
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,833
You don't have to worry.

299
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,253
Since you came here,

300
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,202
so many people have been asking
me to introduce them to you.

301
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,424
They think you work
so fast and thoroughly.

302
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:07,266
You flatter me.

303
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,668
I guess that's true, though.

304
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,378
My hands are a gem.

305
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:17,434
-Your paws, my paws
-Your paws, my paws

306
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:20,245
-Have a nice day.
-Thanks.

307
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,900
Give me a call when you go to lunch.

308
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:24,312
Okay.

309
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:27,686
Hello, Car Cleaning Service
That Brings Happiness.

310
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,206
Complex Three?

311
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:36,425
Why don't you eat?

312
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,766
I asked for extra liver and lung.

313
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,399
My liver and lungs are in pain right now.

314
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:50,067
That's why I can't eat this.

315
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,067
Then eat this.

316
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:57,116
Well...

317
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,801
The fish cakes are all swollen up...

318
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,100
...just like my heart
after crying so much.

319
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,958
How pitiful. The carrot...

320
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:13,799
Do you see the carrot that's sticking out?

321
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,867
It reminds me of my bleeding heart.

322
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,042
What's with you?

323
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,100
Is love such a big deal?

324
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,634
Don't say that.

325
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:28,408
It might not be a big
deal to you, but to me,

326
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,853
it was my last dream.

327
00:22:37,032 --> 00:22:39,976
After I quit sports,
all I was able to do was...

328
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,399
...follow Eun Hee around.

329
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:45,733
Now I can neither do sports...

330
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,733
...nor...

331
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:50,947
...think of Eun Hee anymore.

332
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,433
Yeong Sik.

333
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:00,412
Sorry.

334
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,944
I'm here to celebrate,
but now I'm whining.

335
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,699
It's okay. I'm sorry.

336
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,645
If you hadn't gotten injured and quit,

337
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,434
you would have become
the best in college by now.

338
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,478
Anyway, you got into Hanguk University?
Congratulations.

339
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:18,779
O Sol must be so happy for you.

340
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,733
I haven't told my family yet.

341
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,211
I let you know before anyone else.

342
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:24,158
Really?

343
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,254
O Sol would be so excited.

344
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,813
Should I tell her later?

345
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,486
Good news should be shared early.

346
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,886
Why would you? Do you even
know where she works?

347
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,954
Of course. She was cleaning
with me until a moment ago.

348
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:36,911
Hold on a second.

349
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,767
Good news should be shared.

350
00:23:40,566 --> 00:23:42,543
Hold on. I made a mistake.

351
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:59,200
That's too bad.

352
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,466
You think I'm such a jerk.

353
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,334
Gosh.

354
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,000
Why did he have to be there
right at that moment?

355
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,800
No.

356
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,100
What's wrong? It's true anyway.

357
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,525
Yes.

358
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:20,980
I shouldn't think about it.

359
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,345
I shouldn't think about it anymore.

360
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:25,700
Stop thinking about it.

361
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,100
Hey, Gil O Sol!

362
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:42,021
Hey.

363
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,049
Yeong Sik, you...

364
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,166
I'm sorry. Please kill me.

365
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,933
Let go of my hand.

366
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,400
Hey! O Dol!

367
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,043
You were bragging about your new job.

368
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:06,674
And you were cleaning office buildings?

369
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:08,530
You're mistaken.

370
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:13,263
I don't usually clean office buildings.

371
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:14,378
Just sometimes.

372
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:16,457
Is this what you quit hurdling for?

373
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,788
You said you'd do your best
to find a job and look at you now.

374
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:22,920
-How do I look?
-Does Dad know?

375
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,533
Does he know what you do?

376
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,478
Have you told him?

377
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,464
Am I crazy?

378
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:29,004
It's nothing to brag about.

379
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:31,964
Hey, O Dol.

380
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:34,879
Why would you say that?
What's so wrong about cleaning?

381
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,779
What are you talking about?
Just look at yourself in the mirror.

382
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:40,578
Other girls your age wear skirts and
high heels, and work in tall buildings.

383
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:42,408
What are you doing here?

384
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,634
Who even designed that uniform?

385
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,516
The color stands out too much.

386
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,214
Are you talking about Seon Gyeol?

387
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,429
Yes.

388
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,668
He's changed so much
that I'm often surprised.

389
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,232
Is the doctor called Daniel?

390
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:20,399
I guess he helped a lot.

391
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,400
In my opinion,

392
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,633
he's been affected more
by the employee called Gil O Sol.

393
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:29,978
Who?

394
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:33,598
Her name is Gil O Sol.
She's one of our new hires.

395
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,776
Since she joined the company,

396
00:26:36,566 --> 00:26:38,733
Mr. Jang has changed.

397
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:40,695
Totally different.

398
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,606
Gil O Sol?

399
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:51,633
(Grilled beef entrails)

400
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:56,133
(Spare ribs, pork belly)

401
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,833
Gosh, this place is awesome.

402
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,033
The meat here is really delicious.
Plus the sauce.

403
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,749
Eat up. It's getting burnt.

404
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:11,029
I'll do it.

405
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,133
It's okay. Go on and eat.

406
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,434
It's only temporary. As a part-time job.

407
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:25,389
How long is temporary?

408
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,165
Until I save money to find a job.

409
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,084
That's not even a large amount.

410
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,333
Just ask dad for some money.
Why are you suffering like this?

411
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:37,589
Our family isn't totally broke.
Why are you being so pathetic?

412
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,992
Hey, you're being too harsh.

413
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:42,594
Why are you saying that?

414
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,676
You just don't know well.

415
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:47,666
Our company pays a generous
sum of money, provides welfare,

416
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:51,670
and it's a great company
we can work for our entire lives.

417
00:27:53,582 --> 00:27:55,949
Dad should be the only one
who cleans for a living.

418
00:27:57,113 --> 00:27:58,814
You don't have to do the same thing.

419
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,560
Dad got fired from work.

420
00:28:05,366 --> 00:28:08,200
I didn't want to worry you
since you were busy with your sports.

421
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:10,734
Dad lost his job.

422
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,493
I tried to find a job here and there,

423
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,953
but I failed.

424
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:24,636
There aren't many people
who do something they actually want.

425
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,222
Rather than where you work,

426
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:31,009
how you work is more important.

427
00:28:33,526 --> 00:28:34,760
At least that's how I feel.

428
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,104
And I'm very happy right now.

429
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:48,415
I'm doing this work
because it's really fun.

430
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,033
You know it too.

431
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:55,426
I only do things that are fun.

432
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,463
Liar.

433
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:00,566
Then why did you give up being an athlete?

434
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,733
Because I got bored of it.

435
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,314
I don't do boring things.

436
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:15,418
I told you before.

437
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:21,737
By the way,

438
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:23,793
who says I gave up?

439
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:26,649
I never gave up.

440
00:29:27,981 --> 00:29:29,682
I just chose a different path.

441
00:29:31,941 --> 00:29:33,708
This is a path I chose,

442
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:35,967
so you don't have to worry.

443
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:38,786
Just focus on your training.

444
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:40,914
Okay?

445
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:44,051
Hurry and eat up.

446
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:58,915
Wait.

447
00:29:59,678 --> 00:30:01,254
Don't tell Dad that you know.

448
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,511
Dad, I'm home.

449
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,118
Hello, my daughter.

450
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,774
How was your day today?

451
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:11,784
Look, she's so funny.

452
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,027
Why are you two coming home together?

453
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:17,562
The university has confirmed
recruiting O Dol,

454
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,544
so I treated him to some
meat to congratulate him.

455
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:21,567
Really? That's so good to hear.

456
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:23,911
Which university? Hanguk University?

457
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,500
Did you make it into Hanguk University?

458
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,300
Yes.

459
00:30:27,632 --> 00:30:30,311
He really wanted to go there.
Isn't it amazing?

460
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,878
My goodness, my son!

461
00:30:33,066 --> 00:30:36,233
I'm so proud of you, my son. Come here.

462
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,652
You did such a great job.

463
00:30:38,741 --> 00:30:41,741
Didn't I tell you? I knew you'd make it!

464
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,251
Hold on. We shouldn't just stand here.

465
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,885
We should throw a party or something.

466
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:50,808
O Sol, go and bring Choi.
Let's throw a party.

467
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:54,180
Let's see what we have
in the fridge for our party.

468
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:55,489
There's no need.

469
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:57,989
I'm tired. I need some rest.

470
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,667
What's wrong with him?

471
00:31:15,766 --> 00:31:18,634
You didn't even know the
air shower was turned off?

472
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:22,401
May I ask what it was that made you...

473
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,733
...experience such panic?

474
00:31:28,032 --> 00:31:28,887
Yes.

475
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:34,006
There's this girl
who thinks of me as a total fool...

476
00:31:35,718 --> 00:31:37,729
That person you said is the only person...

477
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
...who can touch you?

478
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,468
Yes.

479
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,931
Because of her,

480
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,734
I couldn't think of anything else.

481
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,267
I guess that person...

482
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,367
...must be very special to you.

483
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,767
By any chance,

484
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,434
do you like that person?

485
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,867
Enough to protect her?

486
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:10,028
I'm not sure.

487
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,399
I haven't thought about it that deeply.

488
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,900
But why are you asking me this?

489
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:20,633
Is this also part of my therapy?

490
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:21,938
No.

491
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,585
I was just curious.

492
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:27,356
I wanted to know
what kind of person you are...

493
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:31,033
...as a man...

494
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,767

After receiving your consent,

496
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:46,266
I obtained the medical records
from the hospital in the US.

497
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,334
It seems like your mysophobia...

498
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,800
...comes from your family.

499
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:56,666
I'll have to look more into it...

500
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:00,533
...but...

501
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,267
...I believe we'll have
a lot to talk about.

502
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,367
Do I like her...

503
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,900
...enough to protect her?

-Good job today.

(3 Missed Calls)

508
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,261
Hello?

509
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:38,521
Yes.

510
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,679
What?

511
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,147
My mom?

512
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,634
Mom! Mom!

513
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:08,466
Mom! Mom!

514
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,000

00:35:53,533 --> 00:35:54,800
This wasn't worth it.

(I'm growing up every day.)

518
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,133
Gosh!

519
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:40,815
Who are you?

520
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,661
Are you the guy I know?

521
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:47,132
Maybe?

522
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:50,022
Oh, my goodness.

523
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:52,148
Is today a special day?

524
00:37:52,848 --> 00:37:53,726
Are you going somewhere?

525
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,974
I have something to take care of.

526
00:37:57,948 --> 00:38:00,248
What's the occasion?
You're dressed up to the nines.

527
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,927
You must be heading out
to confess to your first love.

528
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:06,382
Right? You must be.

529
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,293
No, it's not that.

530
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,982
Come on, don't give me that.

531
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:13,681
Why didn't you dress up like this earlier?

532
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:17,936
You know you have to just brave it
and tell her how you feel, right?

533
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,143
You're a good guy, so be confident.

534
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:24,481
You got this!

535
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:27,714
I got this.

536
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,749
I've got to go. I'm running late.

537
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:31,214
Best of luck!

538
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:41,381
Clothes sure make the man.

539
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,548
You first.

540
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:01,472
No.

541
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,942
You can go first, Ms. Gil.

542
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:06,026
Sure. I will, then.

543
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:07,147
Wait.

544
00:39:12,495 --> 00:39:13,330
What is it?

545
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,084
Do you have something to say to me?

546
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:18,948
Well, it's...

547
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,015
If what I said to you
in front of my place that day...

548
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:25,514
...hurt your feelings...

549
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:27,098
...I apologize.

550
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:29,885
What, specifically?

551
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:32,904
That you have no interest in dating?

552
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:35,782
I thought we had sorted it all out.

553
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:38,710
And I told you that I'm in the same boat.

554
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:40,660
I don't want to date,
especially someone like you.

555
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:41,631
Yes, you did.

556
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:43,581
You said that, but...

557
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:47,393
Ms. Gil.

558
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,388
Do you really think...

559
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,890
I'm...

560
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,292
I'm that obnoxious?

561
00:39:59,013 --> 00:39:59,885
Yes,

562
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:01,602
you are obnoxious.

563
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:05,039
People who play with others' feelings...

564
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:07,613
...are so obnoxious in my opinion.

565
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:16,459
I can go if you have
nothing else to say, right?

566
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,381
You're here.

567

The air shower has been fixed.

568
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:35,525
Oh, okay.

569
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:37,426
I'll be in my office.

570
00:40:37,514 --> 00:40:39,426
Please call me if you need anything.

571
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:40,405
Ms. Kwon.

572
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:42,581
Yes, sir.

573
00:40:56,047 --> 00:40:56,921
So...

574
00:40:57,526 --> 00:40:58,769
...this isn't about me.

575
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,659
It's my friend's story.

576
00:41:00,848 --> 00:41:01,773
Your friend?

577
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:05,026
Yes, he lives in the States.

578
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,982
You probably don't know him.
He lives in Minnesota.

579
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:09,693
I know him from years ago.

580
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,159
I see.

581
00:41:11,278 --> 00:41:13,693
Anyway, that friend of mine...

582
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,755
...has almost no dating experience.

583
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:20,613
You're married, and you're a woman.

584
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,592
I figured you'd know a lot more
about how women feel.

585
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:28,175
I got your point, so go ahead
and tell me the story.

586
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:30,036
Okay.

587
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:36,581
So...

588
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:39,115
...one day...

589
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,481
...my friend realized there's this girl...

590
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,848
...whom he can't seem
to get out of his mind.

591
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:49,158
-Are you kidding me now?
-I'm sorry.

592
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:50,647
What is the matter with you?

593
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:52,547
It was a girl?

594
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:56,498
Let's be honest.
This is better than a cleaning job.

595
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:58,359
I really liked you.

596
00:41:58,447 --> 00:41:59,300
O Sol.

597
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:01,281
Gil O Sol.

598
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:07,815
Are you all right?

599
00:42:08,748 --> 00:42:11,693
That wound. It must hurt.

600
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,992
Mr. Jang, these are our new hires.

601
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,393
-"Mr. Jang"?
-That horse head?

602
00:42:16,481 --> 00:42:17,482
Mr. Jang!

603
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,126
Mr. Jang.

604
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:22,660
He feels that she lives in a world
that is totally different from his.

605
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:26,148
Mr. Jang, just one more time.

606
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:29,113
Catch me if you can!

607
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,480
She must've lost her mind.

608
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:31,860
Wait.

609
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,259
I'm feeling queasy.

610
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,547
I'll kill you if you throw up!

611
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:37,159
No. Please, no.

612
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:39,760
I'm sorry. Let me borrow it just once.

613
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,615
Gosh, borrow what?

614
00:42:42,314 --> 00:42:43,848
He doesn't get her,

615
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:47,473
and he didn't even want to understand her.

616
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,315
Hello, sir.

617
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
No.

618
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:10,444
I like Mr. Jang.

619
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:13,760
Our first encounter wasn't a pleasant one,

620
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,716
but since then,

621
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:18,493
I've always thought that
he's a good person.

622
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:19,681
Ms. Gil!

623
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:22,748
You jerk.

624
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:26,348
Mr. Jang.

625
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,270
Ms. Gil.

626
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:32,281
Can you give me your hand?

627
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:34,460
My hand?

628
00:43:34,548 --> 00:43:36,149
I just have to check something.

629
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:41,282
But at some point,

630
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,448
he started having feelings for her.

631
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:02,507
He went through hoops to confirm
his feelings for her...

632
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,834
...and even kissed her...

633
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,881
...but he didn't have the courage
to take it to the next step.

634
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:19,359
He didn't know what to do
as it was his first time.

635
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:22,214
It was probably because he had
never dated anyone before.

636
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:26,392
Later on, he apologized to her...

637
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:27,881
...but her feelings...

638
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:30,048
...had already been hurt.

639
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:35,017
And now,

640
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:38,109
he doesn't even know what to do.

641
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:45,613
Why are you looking at me like that?

642
00:44:48,147 --> 00:44:49,748
That friend of yours...

643
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:53,181
He sounds so clueless.

644
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:56,548
I mean, does he not even watch TV dramas?

645
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:59,149
Oh, I guess he can't watch any
because he lives in the States.

646
00:44:59,681 --> 00:45:02,948
Anyway, what he did is like the worst.

647
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:05,159
Why apologize after a kiss?

648
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:08,681
No, the apology wasn't
about the kiss itself.

649
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:10,592
The overall situation was...

650
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:11,948
In any case.

651
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:16,281
Then...

652
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,793
...what should he do now?

653
00:45:19,944 --> 00:45:21,244
He should tell her his feelings.

654
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:22,660
Tell her his feelings?

655
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:26,249
(Mental Health Forum with Dr. Daniel Choi)
Hello.

656
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:32,625
I heard today's lecturer
is someone who's very famous.

657
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,704
I also heard he's young and handsome.

658
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:36,374
Does he have a girlfriend?

659
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,045
Is he still single because
he's been busy studying?

00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:45,776
Me? I'm just volunteering.

663
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,280
Dr. Daniel is here.

664
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:05,614
Coming through. Excuse me.

665
00:46:08,903 --> 00:46:10,070
He's so handsome.

666
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:13,144
I haven't given a lecture in forever.
I'm nervous.

667
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:14,835
I'm looking forward to it.

668
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:17,077
We're honored to have you here.

669
00:46:17,398 --> 00:46:18,565
Thank you.

670
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:23,793
Yeong Sik, please fill this up with water.

671
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:24,715
Water?

672
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,002
Water...

673
00:46:26,091 --> 00:46:27,592
Oh, I'll do it.

674
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:31,229
I was just packing up anyway.
You can continue.

675
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:32,625
Thank you.

676
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:40,031
I'm sorry, but I have
no interest in dating.

677
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:43,622
Right now, I don't even
want to date anyone.

678
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:47,104
I, too, have no interest
in dating at the moment.

679
00:46:47,601 --> 00:46:50,408
Especially with a guy like you.

680
00:46:50,566 --> 00:46:52,833
Ms. Gil. Do you really think...

681
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,719
I'm that obnoxious?

682
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:59,208
Yes, you are obnoxious.

683
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:01,946
People who play with others' feelings...

684
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:04,486
...are so obnoxious in my opinion.

685
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,380
Hello, Ms. Kim.

686
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:13,014
-Hello.
-How are you feeling today?

687
00:47:13,103 --> 00:47:15,136
-I'm feeling better.
-You're getting better.

688
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:19,713
Hello.

689
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:21,472
Hello.

690
00:47:22,018 --> 00:47:24,919
You can stay seated. Go back to your work.

691
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:30,513
Mr. Kim, you should work out regularly.

692
00:47:30,602 --> 00:47:33,169
Where did he go? Find him right now!

693
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,086
I've treated Choi in
person for many years.

694
00:47:48,781 --> 00:47:51,282
You visit a patient at home?

695
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,571
Doctor!

696
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:57,035
Which area do you specialize in?

697
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,925
Me? I'm...

698
00:47:59,592 --> 00:48:01,426
...a neuropsychiatrist, Dr. Baek.

699
00:48:02,121 --> 00:48:04,154
He's over there! Hurry!

700
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:09,962
-He's not here.
-No?

701
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:11,818
We have to find him.

702
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,097
What's going on?

703
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,850
Doctor!

704
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,586
Hello.

705
00:48:25,744 --> 00:48:27,911
We've met before.

706
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,014
-Who are you?
-Well...

707
00:48:31,788 --> 00:48:35,133
You once visited your patient
who lives on the rooftop...

708
00:48:35,222 --> 00:48:36,422
...of my house.

709
00:48:36,642 --> 00:48:38,516
So you work here?

710
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:42,215
I'm sorry. I'm in a little hurry.

711
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:43,404
Doctor.

712
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:45,807
I'm sorry to say this,

713
00:48:45,896 --> 00:48:48,259
but I have a lot on my mind these days.

714
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:51,398
Could I talk to you?

715
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:54,172
Can you psychoanalyze me?

716
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:57,182
-Over there!
-I'm sorry. Some other time.

717
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,547
Are you okay?

718
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:08,015
Stay away.

719
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:09,860
Stay away!

720
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,049
We finally found him.

721
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:14,775
Mr. Baek, if you steal my gown and
pretend to be a doctor again,

722
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:17,207
I'll report you to the police.
Do you understand?

723
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,582
It's mine!

724
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,356
I'm a doctor, and you're a patient.

725
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:26,879
I'm a doctor, and you're all patients!

726
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:28,678
There he goes again.

727
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,625
Take him.

728
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,747
Stay away! Let go of me!

729
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,314
Put me down!

730
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,480
I'm Dr. Baek!

731
00:49:39,592 --> 00:49:40,859
Dr. Baek!

732
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:43,114
I'll be back!

733
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,248
He's a patient,

734
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,714
not a doctor?

735
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,093
Then what about Rooftop?

736
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,626
What's the most important thing
to young people these days?

737
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:03,326
-Getting a job!
-Getting good grades!

738
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:06,130
-Grades!
-Jobs!

739
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:08,720
All your answers are correct.

740
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:11,042
Grades do matter.

741
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:15,615
But if we put it in a different way,

742
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:19,856
the most important thing
to us would be opportunities.

743
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:23,248
Opportunities to get what we want.

744
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:26,215
The dictionary defines
an opportunity this way.

745
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:29,896
"The right time or
occasion to do something."

746
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,814
Simply put,

747
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:35,676
an opportunity is the moment
we've been waiting for.

748
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:38,666
But when the moment finally comes...

749
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:41,147
...why do we often...

750
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:43,413
...hesitate?

751
00:50:52,831 --> 00:50:53,931
Hi, Ju Yeon.

752
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:57,537
O Sol, come to my school right now.

753
00:50:58,414 --> 00:51:00,981
Something unbelievable is happening here.

754
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,072
Come here right now.

755
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,028
Hurry!

756
00:51:04,691 --> 00:51:05,561
What?

757
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,082
That's because we're afraid of failures.

758
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:13,304
"What if I get turned down?"

759
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:17,308
"What if I make things worse?"

760
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,712
Giving up, we tell ourselves,

761
00:51:20,954 --> 00:51:23,221
"A better opportunity will come."

762
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:27,449
But the lost opportunities
will linger in our memory...

763
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:29,673
...and haunt us.

764
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:40,055
A confession?

765
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,459
Yes, a confession.

766
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:45,769
After the kiss, the girl
must have expected...

767
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:48,118
...a sincere confession.

768
00:51:48,514 --> 00:51:52,109
But what if he gets turned down?

769
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:53,484
I mean...

770
00:51:58,230 --> 00:51:59,190
What's going to happen...

771
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,252
...after the confession?

772
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:07,167
There's no guarantee
that the two can stay together.

773
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,451
If he tells her how he feels,

774
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:13,972
wouldn't that make him irresponsible?

775
00:52:14,581 --> 00:52:16,848
Of course, there's no guarantee.

776
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,596
Emotions aren't always...

777
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,910
...predictable.

778
00:52:25,254 --> 00:52:26,714
So?

779
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:28,447
But isn't the most important thing...

780
00:52:28,838 --> 00:52:32,372
...is how he feels at this moment?

781
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,647
As long as his feelings
are true at this moment...

782
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:40,909
...I don't think he should worry about...

783
00:52:41,919 --> 00:52:44,420
...what will happen
in the future right now.

784
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:54,448
-Mr. Jang.
-Hi.

785
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:56,288
Aren't you going home?

786
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:57,541
Well...

787
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:59,470
Are you going home?

788
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,241
Have all the others left?

789
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,093
Yes. Why?

790
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:06,275
Are you looking for someone?

791
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:09,301
Not at all.

792
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,971
-Has Ms. Gil left too?
-Yes.

793
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,494
She left after talking
to her friend on the phone.

794
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,351
I see.

795
00:53:20,214 --> 00:53:21,381
Thank you for today.

796
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:24,522
Her friend is at Myungwon University.

797
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,335
O Sol said she would meet her there.

798
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,230
I thought you might want to know.

799
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,013
See you.

800
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:38,324
Okay.

801
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:39,726
See you.

802
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,282
Myungwon University?

803
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:49,229
What's taking her so long?

804
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,199
Hey, Ju Yeon.

805
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:01,139
Hey, what took you so long? Come with me.

806
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:03,248
What is it? What's going on?

807
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,081
You'll be so surprised
to see who's in there.

808
00:54:07,169 --> 00:54:09,281
What? What are you talking about?

809
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:11,237
-What's this place?
-Just come with me.

810
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:13,514
In Greek mythology, Caerus, a son of Zeus,

811
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,903
was the personification of opportunity.

812
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,235
The thick hair on the front of his head...

813
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:22,881
...makes it easier for the person
who finds him to grasp him.

814
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:25,644
But the back of his head is bald...

815
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,565
...making it impossible to grasp him...

816
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:32,135
...once he passes by.

817
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:36,847
-Hey.
-Hold on.

818
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:37,981
Let go of me first.

819
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:40,847
-Also, the wings on his body...
-What's going on?

820
00:54:40,935 --> 00:54:44,602
...let him disappear from sight quickly.

821
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:49,820
Rooftop...

822
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:51,008
Right?

823
00:54:51,202 --> 00:54:52,335
It's him, isn't it?

824
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:55,404
The guy who lives on your rooftop
with no job, right?

825
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:00,127
Something that can't be
grabbed once it passes by.

826
00:55:02,605 --> 00:55:05,805
The Greeks called this an "opportunity".

827
00:55:09,902 --> 00:55:10,902
Also,

828
00:55:13,161 --> 00:55:15,962
another term for opportunity is "timing".

829
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,401
A friend I know told me this.

830
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,868
"Timing is..."

831
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:28,464
"...something that gets harder
even if you try to control it."

832
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:33,306
"So don't think too deeply about it..."

833
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:36,800
"...and take action
when you think it's the right time."

834
00:55:40,138 --> 00:55:42,905
Maybe those opportunities
we were so desperate to grab...

835
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,530
...may actually be right in front of us...

836
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,404
...at this moment.

837
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:40,106
Answer the phone.

838
00:56:52,338 --> 00:56:53,371
This is unbelievable.

839
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:57,438
I knew it. He seemed
too handsome for a loser.

840
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:59,373
But he was a doctor?

841
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:02,539
On top of that,
he's from Rochester Clinic.

842
00:57:03,114 --> 00:57:04,879
(Mr. Jang)

843
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:06,256
Goodness gracious.

844
00:57:06,828 --> 00:57:09,498
Hey, rather than do nothing,
let's go say hi.

845
00:57:09,587 --> 00:57:10,479
I want to go talk to him.

846
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,673
I can't believe this. I'm so fortunate.

847
00:57:13,884 --> 00:57:14,968
Aren't you going to answer that?

848
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:15,900
What?

849
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,070
(Mr. Jang)

850
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:23,432
Hello?

851
00:57:26,405 --> 00:57:28,284
Ms. Gil, where are you right now?

852
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:30,950
Do you have something
I need to do for you?

853
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:33,050
No, it's not that.

854
00:57:33,138 --> 00:57:34,784
I just have something to say.

855
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:37,072
What do you want to tell me this time?

856
00:57:39,972 --> 00:57:41,072
Well, it's...

857
00:57:47,705 --> 00:57:50,606
Ms. Gil, stay right there. Don't move.

858
00:57:59,472 --> 00:58:00,639
What's with him?

859
00:58:01,171 --> 00:58:03,238
He doesn't even know where I am.

860
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:09,150
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

861
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:10,751
Don't leave now.

862
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:12,473
Please stay a bit more.

863
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,250
Don't leave like this.

864
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:16,126
Take a picture with us.

865
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:17,751
Please don't go yet.

866
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,596
Hey. The rooftop house guy is coming out.

867
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:36,805
We were about to go inside to say hello.

868
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:41,639
I was worried you'd already left.

869
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,778
Oh, right.

870
00:58:44,932 --> 00:58:46,166
Rooftop...

871
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:49,393
I mean...

872
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,540
Doctor...

873
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:54,771
Were you surprised?

874
00:58:56,651 --> 00:58:57,493
But...

875
00:58:58,196 --> 00:59:00,396
I didn't expect to see you here either.

876
00:59:01,338 --> 00:59:02,205
I see.

877
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,074
I was a bit...

878
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:06,292
No, very surprised.

879
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:11,949
Is this what you meant
when you said you had plans today?

880
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:14,138
Instead of confessing to your first love?

881
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:21,858
Yes.

882
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,685
But I'm thinking of
confessing my love too.

883
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,999
If I miss this opportunity,

884
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:31,034
I might regret it again.

885
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,845
It's you, O Sol.

886
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:44,535
The person...

887
00:59:45,372 --> 00:59:46,750
...I want to protect.

888
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:30,073
This is embarrassing!

889
01:00:31,572 --> 01:00:32,829
This is embarrassing!

890
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:53,706
What are you doing? It's so filthy.

891
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:55,886
Oh my.

892
01:00:56,372 --> 01:00:57,787
You came back alive.

893
01:00:58,372 --> 01:01:01,572
I saved you. I saved your life!

894
01:01:04,338 --> 01:01:05,839
I saved you!

895
01:01:16,193 --> 01:01:17,260
Good job!

896
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,206
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

897
01:01:52,295 --> 01:01:55,808
You don't even know me well.
Why do you want to protect me?

898
01:01:55,939 --> 01:01:57,150
Can we meet right now?

899
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:59,918
I think I already know where you live.

900
01:02:00,006 --> 01:02:01,150
A daily secretary?

901
01:02:01,238 --> 01:02:03,317
-Ms. Gil.
-I am your...

902
01:02:03,405 --> 01:02:05,818
...daily secretary for today,
instead of Ms. Kwon.

903
01:02:05,906 --> 01:02:07,317
Quit your job.

904
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:08,751
Quit this instant!

905
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:10,284
Is this the reason...

906
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:13,278
...I'm going through so much
to work at this company?

907
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:14,504
What do you think, Chairman Cha?

908
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:16,566
Good. Let's hurry things up.

909
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:19,119
No one can come in here now. Don't worry.

910
01:02:30,433 --> 01:02:34,035
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
