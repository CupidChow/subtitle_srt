1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:01,134
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,600
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,133
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,135
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,135
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,968
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:42,968
I never properly...

8
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,600
...said goodbye.

9
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,701
Take care.

10
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,066
I hope...

11
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,268
...you do well.

12
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,435
(President, Jang Seon Gyeol)

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,193
There's no need to submit
a letter of resignation.

14
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,301
I'm the only one who has to leave.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,033
It'd be helpful to the employees...

16
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,968
...if you could choose to stay.

17
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:11,852
There is something...

18
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:15,643
I must tell you about Chairman Cha.

19
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:18,345
At first,

20
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:20,212
-I first met...
-you might think,

21
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,413
it's a personality
that likes to stay neat.

22
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,179
...Chairman Cha at a lecture about OCD.

23
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:26,667
But if they get angry and anxious
when they can't wash their hands,

24
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:30,024
anyone might start having
doubts and think like this.

25
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:34,125
"Is my child suffering
from OCD at an early age?"

26
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:36,631
If your child is suffering from OCD,

27
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,236
it must be very hard
for him as well as for you.

28
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,121
It's my fault that my child
became like this.

29
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:48,987
Did you say you came
because of your grandson?

30
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,076
Yes.

31
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,189
How old is he?

32
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,069
In elementary school? Middle school?

33
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,170
He is...

34
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,203
...about 23? 24, I think.

35
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:02,103
My memory keeps fading as I get older.

36
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,370
You must care dearly for your grandson.

37
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:10,469
After that, I met Chairman Cha
one more time.

38
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:12,903
After Ms. Kim Geum Ja passed away,

39
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:17,079
he worried about you as
you couldn't seem to open up to anyone.

40
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:22,773
And he asked me if I could help you.

41
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:27,474
Since he knew my son had OCD,

42
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,403
he probably thought
he could fully trust in me.

43
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,416
I accepted his request
for the same reason.

44
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,782
I've already submitted
my letter of resignation.

45
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:44,149
I have no reason to stay
at Cleaning Fairy...

46
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,016
...with you gone.

47
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:51,949
Thank you...

48
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:56,649
...very much for everything.

49
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,150
Mr. Jang!

50
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:22,016
Are you really leaving like this?

51
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,859
Please don't leave, sir.

52
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,517
What are we supposed to do?

53
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:31,293
I brought you here.

54
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:34,083
-I'm sorry I'm leaving, Dong Hyeon.
-Mr. Jang.

55
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:36,849
Call me right away if anything
happens to your grandmother.

56
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,650
I promised you I'd take responsibility,

57
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,049
so don't feel bad.

58
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:45,616
I enjoyed your movie.

59
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:49,283
I didn't think you were serious
about acting, but I was wrong.

60
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,194
That was very cool.

61
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,682
You were serious, and your eyes lit up.

62
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:56,666
Good luck.

63
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:58,650
I'll be rooting for you.

64
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,049
Mr. Jang.

65
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:05,483
-And you, Yeong Sik.
-Yes, sir.

66
00:05:05,716 --> 00:05:08,584
I think you're cut out for this business.

67
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:12,949
No matter how tough and
exhausting the job is,

68
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,449
you get it done with a smile.

69
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,016
I learned a lot from you.

70
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:18,586
Thank you.

71
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,071
Mr. Jang.

72
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,450
A coward who ran away...

73
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,517
...can try but has limits.

74
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:38,582
It's hard to go further too.

75
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,817
For me, the only thing
I could do was enduring.

76
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,549
What? What did you just say?

77
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,861
-You'll give up college?
-Yes, I'm not going to college.

78
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,561
-I don't need to go.
-You spoiled punk, stop spewing...

79
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,861
...complete nonsense.

80
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:58,961
Then what will you do?

81
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:00,828
You'll give up both college and taekwondo?

82
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,983
Then how are you going to earn a living?

83
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,983
O Dol, you can make an impulsive decision
when you're young now.

84
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,261
But when it comes to your career path,

85
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,116
you can't be that emotional.

86
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:14,282
You know, right? "The moment
you give up, it's over."

87
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,628
"Slam Dunk". I let you borrow
the entire series from me.

88
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:19,116
What's the matter with you people?
I never said I'd quit taekwondo.

89
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,250
I'm going to stick with taekwondo.

90
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,850
What? You'll get back into it?

91
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,283
I've done some thinking,
and O Sol is right.

92
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:34,250
Running away isn't me.

93
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:38,082
So I've decided to just face the
problem head-on. With my talent.

94
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:41,060
I can't participate in
competitions during my suspension,

95
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,561
but I can keep training.

96
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,583
I can still join a professional team
even if I don't go to college.

97
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,050
If I manage to pull that off,
a year-long suspension...

98
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,250
Sure, they can suspend me.

99
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,383
You made a wise decision.

100
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:06,582
Ju Yeon!

101
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:09,882
Hey.

102
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,449
Here.

103
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,916
Hold onto it again
until I win a gold medal.

104
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:20,882
Do it for me.

105
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,316
I won't be an idiot anymore.

106
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:27,516
I swear in front of you.

107
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,750
Min Ju Yeon, you have my vow. For real.

108
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:34,282
Okay?

109
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,249
Put me down!

110
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:45,716
(Hyundae Stationery)

111
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:50,550
Inside, you'll find...

112
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,540
...something really awesome.

113
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,050
Something I treasure a lot.

114
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,783
Mister!

115
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,616
Oh, you're the boy who lost his tooth.

116
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:05,883
Where is she?

117
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:10,317
-What?
-You know, your girlfriend.

118
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,315
My girlfriend?

119
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,716
Did you get dumped?

120
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,682
-Yes.
-You should've been good to her.

121
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,085
I know, right?

122
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,271
I should've been good to her.

123
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,683
By any chance,

124
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:30,684
do you know what this is?

125
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,350
Oh, it's...

126
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,383
-What is it?
-One more time.

127
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,461
-"One more time"?
-Yes.

128
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,150
It gives you a chance
to try one more time.

129
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,082
It's an awesome thing to have.

130
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,728
(Fifth Place)

131
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,427
Hey, Dong Hyeon!

132
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:50,216
-Hurry up!
-Okay, just a second.

133
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:52,150
Bye.

134
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:10,383
I'm here because Dr. Kim
asked me to check in.

135
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:14,127
A visit for emotional stability of
a patient with stage-four cancer.

136
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:16,528
I just asked for some painkillers.

137
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,816
I heard you're refusing
to receive radiation therapy.

138
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:21,383
Then the pain will be too much
for you to bear.

139
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,783
Why didn't you tell anyone?

140
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:28,416
You didn't tell the media
about my condition.

141
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:32,183
You were determined
to threaten me that day.

142
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:36,394
Did your conscience as
a doctor bog you down?

143
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,749
My conscience as a doctor?

144
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:41,149
Perhaps.

145
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,416
Frankly, I never planned on exposing it.

146
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,050
I didn't think threatening
you using your weakness...

147
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,050
...would change anything.

148
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:55,616
What is your relationship
with Ms. Gil O Sol?

149
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
Are you...

150
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:02,449
...one of the people
who claim to be the victims...

151
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,016
...of the Jungang-dong incident?

152
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,074
No.

153
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,849
I'm not one of the victims.

154
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,050
I was actually one of the assailants.

155
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,895
You scumbags, kill me first.

156
00:10:20,983 --> 00:10:23,217
-Send another ambulance! Quick!
-You jerks.

157
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,594
Mom!

158
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:26,882
Honey, honey!

159
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,517
It was so cruel.

160
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:31,283
Although you probably
want to avoid the truth.

161
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,049
A perfectionist with
masochistic tendencies.

162
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:39,050
A workaholic who's obsessed with
work only to become more perfect.

163
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,983
And depression is unavoidable
because you're never...

164
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,650
...satisfied with anything.

165
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,650
You tried to protect
everything, didn't you?

166
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,182
From your company to your family.

167
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,550
But what did you manage to maintain?

168
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,883
To me,

169
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,548
it seems like you've reached your limits.

170
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:13,294
The tranquilizers you asked for
could cause breathing problems...

171
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,515
...when taken with opioids,
so I won't prescribe them.

172
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,541
If the pain becomes too unbearable,

173
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,183
please let me know.

174
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:39,849
Mr. Choi.

175
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,283
Are you here to see O Sol?

176
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:43,269
No.

177
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:45,816
I'm here to see you.

178
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:48,816
I'd like to consult my doctor...

179
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:55,616
I mean, I have a favor to ask.

180
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,016
Hey, O Dol. Wake up, will you?

181
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:05,883
How could you sleep in after
saying you want to start afresh?

182
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,494
Wake up. Wake up already!

183
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:11,149
-I got my morning training done.
-You sleep in every day!

184
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:14,183
And what is all this? Tidy up, please.

185
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,949
"Dear Ju Yeon. I mean, my Ju Yeon."

186
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,083
"I don't know when it began, but I
can't stop thinking about you..."

187
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,616
"...and I'm struggling
to focus on my training."

188
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:30,682
"Ju Yeon, I love you as much
as I love the turning kick."

189
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,350
"From your man, Gil O Dol."

190
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:35,094
Gosh, why are you reading my letter?

191
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:37,749
Hey, since when?

192
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,283
How dare you have a crush on my friend?

193
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:41,861
Let go.

194
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:43,294
-Come here.
-Let go of me.

195
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:47,083
Are you going to start afresh as
Ju Yeon's boyfriend or what? Hey!

196
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,417
Are you going to call her now?

197
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:50,403
O Sol.

198
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,116
Can we talk?

199
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:57,615
The US?

200
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,415
He wanted me...

201
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,382
...to pass this to you.

202
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:07,749
Do you want to go say goodbye?

203
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:10,150
I don't think it's too late yet.

204
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,482
It's okay.

205
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,082
I already said goodbye.

206
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:26,083
I'm sorry, Chairman Cha.

207
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,350
It was supposed to be the shortest way.

208
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,350
(In memory of the Jungang-dong
disaster victims)

209
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:34,616
What you mean by proper and reasonable...

210
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,317
...are all based on your standards.

211
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:39,749
Just like how you've
treated me all this time.

212
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,616
I won't run away from you,

213
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,250
nor evade you.

214
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:46,882
I won't hide because I'm scared of you.

215
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,849
Nor will I stay resentful.

216
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:51,649
No more leaving regrets behind.

217
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:54,461
Because you are the one who should suffer.

218
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:55,816
Mr. Jang doesn't...

219
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,250
...deserve this pain.
You should be the one to suffer.

220
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,649
Turn the car around.

221
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:07,915
Yes, Chairman Cha.

222
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,516
What brings you here?

223
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,050
I didn't expect to see you again.

224
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,315
Well...

225
00:15:37,882 --> 00:15:38,949
There is something...

226
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:41,949
...I have to tell you.

227
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:45,116
That's why I came here.

228
00:16:32,248 --> 00:16:33,448
To be honest,

229
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:38,149
I've never done this before.

230
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,016
I don't know...

231
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,716
...what is the best way.

232
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,816
I don't know what would be
the most suitable thing...

233
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:53,282
...for me to say.

234
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,016
I really have no idea.

235
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:52,782
I'm sorry.

236
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:01,350
I know it's too late...

237
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,616
...for an apology.

238
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,016
I am...

239
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,083
...really sorry.

240
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,582
That's enough.

241
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,283
You can go back now.

242
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,717
It must not have been easy
for you to apologize.

243
00:19:16,515 --> 00:19:19,615
But it is just as hard
for us to forgive you.

244
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,816
It'll take some time.

245
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,550
But I won't forget...

246
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:27,448
...what you did today.

247
00:19:30,215 --> 00:19:31,615
Goodbye.

248
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,850
You were right.

249
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:42,348
I was the one who should have regrets...

250
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,449
...and suffer.

251
00:20:02,449 --> 00:20:05,816
This old man's greed has
caused you too much pain.

252
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:09,817
I hurt both you and Seon Gyeol...

253
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:13,216
...too much.

254

AG Group...

256

...has implemented numerous
redevelopment projects...

257
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:26,427
...up to this day.

258
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,782
However, during that process,

259
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:31,249
there were many victims
who were sacrificed,

260
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:33,262
and we admit our mistake.

(AG Group Chairman Cha Seok
Hwan's Press Conference)

262
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,216
Everything is...

263
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:42,928
...my fault as the group chairman.

264
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:44,917
I will take full responsibility...

265
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,717
...by resigning from my position.

266
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:51,215
Also, I will donate...

267
00:23:52,215 --> 00:23:53,515
...all of the assets under my name...

268
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:56,761
...to the society.

269
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,550
-I have a question.
-Mr. Cha!

270
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,083
Nobody is talking about that person.

271
00:24:07,182 --> 00:24:10,549
I don't dare to utter that name as well.

272
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,116
As time passes by,

273
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,549
the memories of him
that filled my heart become smaller.

What are you guys doing here?

277
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,982
What do you think?

278
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,916
We're here to clean.

279
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,650
Mr. Jang asked us...

280
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,650
...before he went to the US. No...

281
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:52,049
...he asked us a long time ago
to take care of this place.

282

But sometimes...

283

Very seldom...

284
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,615
I miss you.

285

-My gosh.

Hey. Who are you to tell me what to do?

300
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:54,850
Give that to me. Give it back.

301
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,582
-Hey.
-Sir.

302
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,016
-Give it back!
-Wait.

303
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,261
-You shouldn't do this.
-I told you to give it back!

-You punk.
-Mister.

You look much more handsome like this.

Can I throw this away for you?

307

Yes, sir. Okay.

312

00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:36,257
Sounds great.

333
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:37,582
How about some beer too?

334
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:40,739
Okay. Tonight's menu is chicken and beer.

335
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,248
Okay.

336
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,550
I have to cross the road.
I'm hanging up, Dad.

337
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,016
Thank you.

338
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,949
It's been a long time, Ms. Gil.

339
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:57,682
-How were...
-How...

340
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,816
When did you come back to Korea?

341
00:31:15,816 --> 00:31:19,317
Oh, I was on my way
from the airport just now.

342
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:32,450
Are you okay now?

343
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:33,825
What?

344
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:40,249
I've become much better.

345
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,150
I don't know what all
the fuss was about...

346
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:45,682
...for me to be so sensitive before.

347
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:51,815
You look exactly the same, O Sol.

348
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:57,883
Oh, your style has changed a bit.

349
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:02,883
But you look the same as before.

350
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:17,383
I'm sorry about my grandfather.

351
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:23,449
I know it's useless to apologize now.

352
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:28,750
About your mother's accident
or your brother's issue,

353
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,049
I should've asked for
forgiveness before I left.

354
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:37,983
But I didn't have the courage.

355
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:43,182
I didn't know what to do either.

356
00:32:45,315 --> 00:32:46,849
It's all in the past.

357
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:50,882
It wasn't your fault either.

358
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,316
Still, I wanted to apologize.

359
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:01,249
I didn't know you had experienced
something like that...

360
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,382
...and made you suffer by liking you.

361
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:11,317
I felt very sorry.

362
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,049
I'm sorry,

363
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:27,750
but I should get going.

364
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:34,616
Wait.

365
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:47,348
If this is still valid,
I'd like us to start over.

366
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:50,583
You and I, from the beginning.

367
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:54,348
I want another chance.

368
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,583
It's cold, O Sol.
What are you doing out here?

369
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:32,448
Are you getting home just now?

370
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:37,450
I guess that store brought
the machine back.

371
00:34:38,382 --> 00:34:40,415
Didn't they get rid of it
last year because it broke?

372
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,160
Well, if you're free this weekend...

373
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:48,515
I...

374
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,750
...ran into Mr. Jang earlier today.

375
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,583
He's back in Korea now.

376
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:01,783
His mysophobia seems
to have gotten a lot better.

377
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:05,317
I think he's doing much better
than before.

378
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:08,782
He's back.

379
00:35:11,515 --> 00:35:12,782
That's great.

380
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:23,381
-Out of the blue...
-My gosh.

381
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:24,716
He's here.

382
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:27,483
Seon Gyeol! My gosh.

383
00:35:28,582 --> 00:35:31,682
You left without a word.
Now you came back without a word. Gosh.

384
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:33,782
Has everything been well with you?

385
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:36,616
Mr. Yang and Mr. Kim, you're here too.

386
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:37,950
My, look at you.

387
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:41,116
I guess living in the US
made you even more handsome.

388
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:42,515
Have you been well?

389
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,016
Yes.

390
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:47,516
Thank you for taking great care
of my mother while I was gone.

391
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,516
I think I can trust you...

392
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,116
...with my mother.

393
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:03,616
Please continue to take great care of her.

394
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,350
What? Are you serious?

395
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:11,250
My gosh. You heard that, right?

396
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:14,649
I feel like I'm going to tear up.

397
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:21,383
Don't be silly. Why are you crying?

398
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,016
I'll be good to her, okay?

399
00:36:48,315 --> 00:36:50,016
Mister, you're stepping on poop.

400
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,078
What?

401
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:56,182
Oh, no.

402
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,816
I stepped on bird poop.

403
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:02,083
That's gross.

404
00:37:08,382 --> 00:37:10,895
By the way, who are you?
Why did you come out of there?

405
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,761
Shouldn't you introduce yourself first...

406
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,316
...before asking me who I am?
Isn't that what's called manners?

407
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:18,315
What?

408
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:19,816
Ye Joon!

409
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:23,549
Mr. Jang.

410
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:24,983
Ms. Kwon.

411
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,316
He's a big boy now.

412
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:37,783
Actually, I've only heard about him.
This is my first time meeting him.

413
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,995
By the way, what brought you here?

414
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:44,828
I come here every weekend
to see Chairman Cha.

415
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,601
He's here all alone.
There's no one to look after him.

416
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,850
I figured he'd be lonely.

417
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:56,983
Where is he now?

418
00:38:06,148 --> 00:38:09,016
You've been out for too long, sir.

419
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:11,849
Let's head back inside now.

420
00:38:15,949 --> 00:38:18,583
Look at all these plants.

421
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:21,149
It's still cold,

422
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,950
but they look as if
they're already welcoming spring.

423
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,183
Grandpa.

424
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:05,116
They say that you gain a lot more...

425
00:39:06,382 --> 00:39:09,149
...from letting go. That saying is...

426
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,516
...so true.

427
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:16,283
Looking back,

428
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:19,616
it was nothing.

429
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:23,349
I only realized it
after I let go of control.

430
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:25,915
I heard...

431
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:29,916
...that you hired management
specialists for AG...

432
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,883
...and donated all of your assets.

433
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,150
I didn't think...

434
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,715
...you'd ever come back.

435
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:44,383
I thought I'd never get to see you again.

436
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:48,383
Thank you...

437
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,450
...for coming back.

438
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:26,949
No.

439
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:28,349
I shouldn't.

440
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,183
Don't look at it.

441
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,149
Can we meet up briefly today?

442
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:47,082
I'll be in the area.

443
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,450
-He's so handsome.
-Look at him.

444
00:40:53,616 --> 00:40:56,450
-Oh, my.
-He's totally my type.

445
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:58,650
-My gosh.
-Look at him.

446
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,449
-Oh, my.
-How handsome.

447
00:41:01,248 --> 00:41:02,482
He's so good-looking.

448
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:05,416
Look at that.

449
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,215
Oh, my goodness.

450
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,382
Mr. Jang?

451
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,694
Who is he talking to?

452
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,982
What's he trying to say?

453
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:33,215
Could it be me?

454
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:45,049
-What's happening?
-Oh, no!

455
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,516
-What if he gets hurt?
-Mr. Jang.

456
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,484
-I think he fell!
-My gosh!

457
00:41:53,816 --> 00:41:54,949
Thank you.

458
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:56,715
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

459
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:57,721
What?

460
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,749
I didn't hold the rope properly.

461
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:04,383
Did you run here to make sure I was okay?

462
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:08,450
No, not really.

463
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:10,036
I'm happy...

464
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,016
...to know that you were worried about me.

465
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:13,315
Well...

466
00:42:13,582 --> 00:42:14,693
What are you doing here?

467
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:17,521
Well... Practicing.

468
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,617
Did you get my text?

469
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:27,033
If you have time later,

470
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:30,349
-why don't we have dinner...
-No. I'm working late.

471
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:36,360
I'll wait for you.

472
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:40,767
Don't mind me. Go back to work.

473
00:42:42,148 --> 00:42:44,982
As you can see, I'm working too.

474
00:42:48,379 --> 00:42:49,252
Let's work.

475
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:57,949
Here's your food.

476
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:02,916
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

477
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,089
It looks so tasty.

478
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:16,089
I craved it so much in the US.

479
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:19,256
Noodles in steaming-hot anchovy stock.

480
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:23,156
I never craved it before.

481
00:43:23,622 --> 00:43:26,156
You appreciate things more
when  you can't get them, right?

482
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:36,479
Why aren't you eating?

483
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:38,076
You love noodles.

484
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:45,022
This isn't going to change anything.

485
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:50,989
The time is up.

486
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,189
You can't exchange...

487
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,655
...the fifth-place prize anymore.

488
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,122
-Ms. Gil.
-That stationery store...

489
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:06,655
...threw out the machine
a year ago because it broke.

490
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:11,622
And we broke up two years ago.

491
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:20,955
I'm glad you're back.

492
00:44:22,154 --> 00:44:23,988
And I'm relieved you look well.

493
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,256
But that's all.

494
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:33,755
I'm sorry. You waited so long.

495
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:39,789
I have to go now.

496
00:45:01,922 --> 00:45:03,055
Wait.

497
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:05,048
Just a second.

498
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,822
There is something I haven't told you yet.

499
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:18,956
I missed you a lot.

500
00:45:21,688 --> 00:45:23,189
It's like a dream...

501
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:28,756
...to be in front of you like this.
That's how desperately I missed you.

502
00:45:32,388 --> 00:45:33,688
I won't rush you...

503
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:36,989
...to like me...

504
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:40,522
...or look back at me.

505
00:45:43,688 --> 00:45:44,855
I'll wait...

506
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,055
...for you...

507
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:53,622
...to make up your mind.

508
00:46:12,622 --> 00:46:14,066
Thanks to Choi, I realized...

509
00:46:14,154 --> 00:46:16,588
...confidence is everything.

510
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:21,421
The spirits have always been with me.

511
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,689
-And I had no idea.
-You're right.

512
00:46:24,889 --> 00:46:26,690
I decided to have confidence...

513
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:28,755
...and start over.

514
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:30,467
I'll be back.

(Letter of Acceptance)

516
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,088
Dr. Baek.

517
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:39,590
Are you sure it's not fake?

518
00:46:40,488 --> 00:46:43,289
It's not fake.

519
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:44,855
Actually,

520
00:46:46,855 --> 00:46:48,356
I have an announcement to make too.

521
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:51,523
Well, everyone...

522
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:54,188
...I'm getting married.

523
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:57,355
-Oh, my.
-Are you sure it's not fake?

524
00:46:58,855 --> 00:47:00,522
It's all thanks to you.

525
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:02,022
Thank you.

526
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,421
You used to chase me around.

527
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:09,688
-I'm a little disappointed.
-I want you to become happy too.

528
00:47:11,321 --> 00:47:13,155
What's with you guys?

529
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:15,089
I'm very happy.

530
00:47:15,855 --> 00:47:19,222
Here. Everyone chipped in.

531
00:47:19,557 --> 00:47:20,657
Please take it.

532
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:25,755
You treated us for free
for the past two years.

533
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:29,188
Take it. It'll come in handy someday.

534
00:47:29,655 --> 00:47:30,722
Thank you.

535
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:33,388
I appreciate it.

536
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:36,256
Why don't we take a picture together?

537
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:40,289
-To celebrate our last counseling.
-That sounds good.

538
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:42,734
Come here.

539
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:44,756
I want to sit next to Choi.

540
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:46,622
All right.

541
00:47:48,054 --> 00:47:49,221
Here we go.

542

Go, O Dol!

548
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:27,767
O Dol, pull yourself together, will you?

549
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:29,322
I'm watching you!

00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,055
Good job!

553
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:50,700
-Gil O Dol became...
-That's my son.

554
00:48:50,788 --> 00:48:52,200
-...the last player...
-That's him.

555
00:48:52,288 --> 00:48:53,867
-...to join the national team...
-Congratulations.

556
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:56,222
-...for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
-He made it to the national team.

557
00:48:56,822 --> 00:48:58,634
Gil, an athlete at the
Dongmyung District Office,

558
00:48:58,722 --> 00:49:02,189
-was a promising player...
-Hello.

559
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:03,705
You saw it?

560
00:49:04,452 --> 00:49:06,786
Of course, I'm following my son to Tokyo.

561
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:10,622
Yes. What?

562
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:13,390
The national team? A gold medal?

563
00:49:13,588 --> 00:49:15,489
We'll see.

564
00:49:16,255 --> 00:49:19,489
All right. Bye.

565
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,222
My goodness.

566
00:49:21,855 --> 00:49:24,422
Now that he made it to the national team,
a gold medal is no problem.

567
00:49:26,688 --> 00:49:28,122
Why is the car so clean?

568
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:31,788
This is my area. Who are you...

569
00:49:36,021 --> 00:49:37,188
Hello, Father.

570
00:49:37,488 --> 00:49:38,922
How have you been?

571
00:49:39,321 --> 00:49:40,655
I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier.

572
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:42,189
What are you doing here?

573
00:49:46,655 --> 00:49:47,560
Well...

574
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,155
...I'd like to help you
with your work from now on.

575
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,356
Please let me.

576
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,087
I don't want you to call me Father.

577
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:58,522
And I don't need your help. Leave.

578
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,555
It's not easy for you to accept me.

579
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:04,156
I know that well.

580
00:50:04,955 --> 00:50:08,055
And it's shameless of me
to ask your forgiveness this way.

581
00:50:08,955 --> 00:50:10,022
I know that too.

582
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:15,423
Still, this is the only thing...

583
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:17,655
...I can do right now.

584
00:50:18,522 --> 00:50:21,989
There is no need for an apology...

585
00:50:22,655 --> 00:50:23,722
...or forgiveness.

586
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:48,388
I missed you a lot.

587
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:50,523
It's like a dream...

588
00:50:51,188 --> 00:50:54,022
...to be in front of you like this.
That's how desperately I missed you.

589
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:14,638
Hello.

590
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:17,002
What?

591
00:51:17,371 --> 00:51:18,312
An accident?

592
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:31,456
I wish I could use magic to see her.

593
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,256

Hakuna matata

595
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:38,788
That won't work.

596
00:51:57,288 --> 00:52:01,122
A friend of mine moved here,
and he wanted to see me.

597
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:05,254
The one from Minnesota, that's him.

598
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,855
By the way, are you going somewhere?

599
00:52:07,522 --> 00:52:08,689
Well...

600
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:12,821
Yes.

601
00:52:13,688 --> 00:52:14,955
Okay, I understand.

602
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:22,288
Yes, sir.

603
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:25,901
Yes, I just talked with the team.

604
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,989
The reporters haven't contacted them yet.

605
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:30,122
Yes, I'm on my way now.

606
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,388
Okay.

607
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,590
(Emergency Ward)

608
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:51,222
-He will be okay.
-Thank you.

609
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:54,922
-How is Cho Hyeon Woo?
-Sir.

610
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:57,562
He just fell asleep.

611
00:52:58,221 --> 00:52:59,988
How is he? Is he all right?

612
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:02,500
Yes. The injury isn't serious,

613
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:04,267
so it won't affect him from playing.

614
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,388
My goodness.

615
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:08,597
What a relief.

616
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:11,867
Thank you for coming so late at night.

617
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:13,355
No problem.

618
00:53:15,054 --> 00:53:16,121
Who are you?

619
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:19,956
Your boyfriend?

620
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:23,056
No. He's not my boyfriend...

621
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:26,422
Gosh. Thank you for driving her
so late at night.

622
00:53:26,522 --> 00:53:28,223
-Thank you.
-Well...

623
00:53:29,021 --> 00:53:30,755
...I'm glad it's not serious.

624
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:32,333
Get your things and come out.

625
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:34,322
I feel so thankful, so I'll treat you
to something good.

626
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:36,600
No, that's fine.

627
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:37,652
You should come too.

628
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:38,741
Oh, sure.

629
00:53:46,622 --> 00:53:47,722
Thank you.

630
00:53:48,321 --> 00:53:49,354
No.

631
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,523
I want to thank you more.

632
00:53:52,154 --> 00:53:53,254
For letting me help you.

633
00:53:56,355 --> 00:53:57,522
You have become...

634
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,590
...a much impressive person
over the last two years.

635
00:54:13,321 --> 00:54:15,155
You must be happy, O Sol.

636
00:54:15,488 --> 00:54:18,322
You have such a reliable
boyfriend like him.

637
00:54:22,922 --> 00:54:24,367
Here, I'll pour you a glass.

638
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:25,344
Okay.

639
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,781
Let me pour you a glass too.

640
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,237
Gosh, thank you very much.

641
00:54:34,488 --> 00:54:35,555
Here.

642
00:54:43,288 --> 00:54:45,022
Wow, that tastes nice.

643
00:54:47,655 --> 00:54:49,256
Let's keep drinking.

644
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:52,522
O Sol, why aren't you drinking today?

645
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:55,156
Your glass is empty.

646
00:54:55,455 --> 00:54:56,588
Here you go.

647
00:55:00,622 --> 00:55:01,689
I will...

648
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:03,986
...drink for her instead.

649
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:06,656
You are such a cool boyfriend.

650
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,726
Here, have another glass.

651
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:13,982
Sure.

652
00:55:14,107 --> 00:55:15,708
-Sir...
-There you go.

653
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:20,320
Cheers.

654
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,087
Cheers.

655
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:41,822
Are you okay?

656
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,674
Can you go home?

657
00:55:48,269 --> 00:55:49,914
You can't even drink that much.

658
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:51,922
Why did you drink for me instead?

659
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,438
Can you wait for me here for a moment?

660
00:55:56,622 --> 00:55:58,423
I'll grab a taxi for you.

661
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:06,388
A little more.

662
00:56:07,855 --> 00:56:10,723
Can you stay with me a little longer?

663
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:41,521
I have...

664
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:48,676
...never forgotten about you
for the past two years.

665
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:56,622
On the day we said goodbye,

666
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:01,898
we didn't even hold hands
for the last time.

667
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:06,517
That kept bugging me in my mind.

668
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:11,855
That's why I left to the US.

669
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:18,068
I had a really hard time living in the US,

670
00:57:22,788 --> 00:57:24,975
but I endured it because of you.

671
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:30,346
In order to meet you again...

672
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:37,352
I didn't want to be
a shameful person to you.

673
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:45,421
I really...

674
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:48,822
...tried so hard, and gave it my best.

675
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:03,465
Can you compliment me at least once?

676
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:15,355
I wish...

677
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:20,721
...you could smile at me.

678
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:26,355
Just once.

679
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:10,089
You did well.

680
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:15,122
I'm proud of you...

681
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:16,722
...Mr. Jang.

682
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,455
To be honest,

683
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:31,323
I was like that too.

684
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:36,256
For two years,

685
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:40,388
there wasn't a single
moment I forgot about you.

686
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,148
How could I forget?

687
00:59:47,522 --> 00:59:49,323
I missed you so much.

688
00:59:56,355 --> 00:59:57,822
I knew my parents...

689
01:00:01,255 --> 01:00:02,922
...and even O Dol...

690
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:07,288
...wouldn't approve of my feelings...

691
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:12,222
...but I missed you so much.

692
01:00:15,989 --> 01:00:17,957
I missed you dearly.

693
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,321
I'm sorry.

694
01:00:27,955 --> 01:00:31,289
I said I wouldn't do
anything that I'd regret.

695
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:40,588
But...

696
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:43,755
...I couldn't help it.

697
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:49,456
There was nothing I could do.

698
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:29,976
Did you get home safely last night?

699
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:31,689
Yesterday,

700
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,789
did I say or do anything foolish?

701
01:01:57,722 --> 01:01:59,232
I hope your stomach isn't upset.

702
01:01:59,321 --> 01:02:01,788
You didn't do anything
foolish, so don't worry.

703
01:02:03,555 --> 01:02:04,655
Nice.

704
01:02:10,522 --> 01:02:12,123
What's going on?

705
01:02:13,221 --> 01:02:14,388
What's this weird pose about?

706
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:19,933
What's with you? Who said
you could barge in here unannounced?

707
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:21,588
You're hurting my feelings here.

708
01:02:22,121 --> 01:02:25,055
I volunteered to take care of
this place while you were gone.

709
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:28,055
I knew it. The place was a mess.

710
01:02:31,355 --> 01:02:33,922
-Do you want some?
-You seem to be doing a lot better.

711
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:35,622
Thanks for everything.

712
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:40,389
Your advice really helped me.

713
01:02:40,922 --> 01:02:44,055
And you kept checking in
on me while I was in the US.

714
01:02:44,788 --> 01:02:45,855
Thanks for that too.

715
01:02:46,788 --> 01:02:50,788
Since I'm back now, I'll repay you
for everything you've done for me.

716
01:02:53,188 --> 01:02:55,889
Right, you should repay me.

717
01:02:56,622 --> 01:02:58,490
But save it for later.

718
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:00,221
For later?

719
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:03,821
How are things with O Sol?

720
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:07,555
Great.

721
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,823
I can be close to her again.

722
01:03:11,421 --> 01:03:12,888
That itself, makes me so happy.

723
01:03:14,688 --> 01:03:18,556
I'm glad to hear that.
I wish the two of you happiness.

724
01:03:19,388 --> 01:03:21,421
Both you and O Sol...

725
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:24,089
...mean a lot to me.

726
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:26,321
Gosh, what's with you?
You're making me cringe.

727
01:03:26,588 --> 01:03:27,771
What's wrong with that?

728
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:29,910
Isn't it American style?

729
01:03:30,288 --> 01:03:31,688
Candidly expressing your feelings.

730
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:35,979
That being said, how about...

731
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,922
...we greet each other American style?

732
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:42,789
Sure. Shall we greet each other...

733
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:44,223
...American style?

734
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:45,822
Shall we?

735
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:49,555
Gosh, no! Get down! Don't.

736
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:51,154
This is too much!

737
01:03:51,855 --> 01:03:53,589
Wait, hang on.

738
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:03,122
Falling on the ice won't kill you.

739
01:04:03,221 --> 01:04:05,288
Just give it a shot! Come on.

740
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,256
Wait, hold on.

741
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:15,056
Like this. Follow what I'm doing.

742
01:04:15,922 --> 01:04:19,389
One foot forward,
and the rest will follow.

743
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:24,321
Are you all right?

744
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:26,555
Get up. I'll help you up.

745
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:37,688
-One foot at a time.
-One foot at a time?

746
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:40,956
-Yes, that's it. You're doing it.
-I'm getting the hang of it!

747
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:43,013
Nice.

748
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,522
-You're doing it.
-I got this. Gosh!

749
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:47,984
Are you all right?

750
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:49,512
Yes.

751
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:52,368
Why did you suggest coming here
when you don't know how to skate?

752
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:56,323
Here, hold my hand.

753
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:06,588
Why are you looking at me like that?

754
01:05:07,688 --> 01:05:09,088
Do I have something on my face?

755
01:05:09,688 --> 01:05:12,155
If you didn't reach your hand out
to me back then,

756
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:15,656
I wouldn't be where I am now.

757
01:05:18,788 --> 01:05:19,888
Thanks.

758
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:22,488
Thanks for everything,

759
01:05:23,955 --> 01:05:27,322
and I'll continue to be grateful.

760
01:05:30,955 --> 01:05:33,363
How random. What are you talking about?

761
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,154
Shall I try again?

762
01:05:46,555 --> 01:05:47,588
One foot at a time.

763
01:05:49,755 --> 01:05:51,689
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

764
01:05:53,488 --> 01:05:54,822
See? You can do it.

765
01:05:56,488 --> 01:05:57,655
You're good.

766
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:16,288
O Sol! Go tell Ha In
that breakfast is ready.

767
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:19,888
Mr. Choi, breakfast is ready.

768
01:06:24,622 --> 01:06:25,755
Mr. Choi?

769
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:28,922
The door is open.

770
01:07:10,942 --> 01:07:13,836
This isn't fair.

771
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:23,888
Just like that, he brought
me solace once again...

772
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:25,988
...and left.

773
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,755
Manners and etiquette.

774
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:35,645
All martial artists are
expected to follow them.

775
01:07:36,588 --> 01:07:40,522
For that reason, you disgraced
your fellow martial artists.

776
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,922
-Are you aware of that?
-Yes, sir!

777
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:48,552
-A package!
-A package delivery.

778
01:07:49,105 --> 01:07:50,238
A package for you.

779
01:07:52,408 --> 01:07:53,322
Hey.

780
01:07:54,388 --> 01:07:57,467
Slap me. Slap me more
if it's going to make you feel better!

781
01:07:57,555 --> 01:07:59,367
Is he a pervert or what?
I can't watch that.

782
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:00,588
I know. Let's just eat.

783
01:08:01,288 --> 01:08:03,122
More. More!

784
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:05,267
My gosh, look who's here.

785
01:08:05,355 --> 01:08:07,722
Mr. Pervert who loves getting slapped.
You're such a celebrity.

786
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:10,488
Hey, guys. Oh, you saw that?

787
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:14,167
I'm coming from a shoot.
I didn't even have time to get changed.

788
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:15,436
I'm enjoying the drama.

789
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:16,600
I've seen you in movies too.

790
01:08:16,688 --> 01:08:18,988
By the way, why did you summon us?

791
01:08:24,344 --> 01:08:25,535
I summoned you guys.

792
01:08:27,054 --> 01:08:28,321
-Mr. Jang!
-Mr. Jang.

793
01:08:30,555 --> 01:08:31,446
Long time no see.

794
01:08:32,735 --> 01:08:33,802
You're back.

795
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:38,054
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

796
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:44,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

797
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:53,196
By the way, why did you summon us?

798
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,655
The thing is...

799
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:03,488
I wanted to meet up with
you guys because...

800
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,255
-Dong Hyeon.
-Yes?

801
01:09:13,688 --> 01:09:14,721
(New Business Plan)

802
01:09:15,522 --> 01:09:16,667
This is...

803
01:09:16,755 --> 01:09:18,427
(Innovative cleaning service
that goes above and beyond)

804
01:09:18,516 --> 01:09:20,450
Would you like to join me?

805
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:23,312
We can work together
again like the old days.

806
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:25,468
I've been waiting for you to come back.

807
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,889
Me too. I really missed you.

808
01:09:30,455 --> 01:09:31,622
For me...

809
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:34,871
I understand, Jae Min.

810
01:09:35,288 --> 01:09:38,300
Continue with your acting career.
That's how you can help us.

811
01:09:38,403 --> 01:09:39,536
I'm sorry.

812
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,627
But I promise I'll promote
the business like no one else can.

813
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:46,256
I'll donate my talent.
Hire me as your model.

814
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:49,289
-That's not...
-May I join too?

815
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:51,321
Ms. Kwon!

816
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:56,847
Mr. Jang, I'd love to work with you again.

817
01:09:57,764 --> 01:09:58,964
You'll accept me, right?

818
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:04,500
Well,

819
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,924
have you eaten yet?

820
01:10:07,977 --> 01:10:09,070
Shall we have a drink?

821
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:10,328
Sounds good.

822
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:13,066
-Have a seat.
-Guys, move.

823
01:10:13,154 --> 01:10:15,488
Right here, we'd like
another bottle of soju.

824
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:31,783
-Thank you in advance.
-Thank you.

825
01:10:54,955 --> 01:10:57,453
All right, shall we get started?

826
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:00,056
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

827
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:02,621
Let's go.

828
01:11:20,955 --> 01:11:22,456
Ta-da.

829
01:11:22,555 --> 01:11:23,755
Jae Min.

830
01:11:23,855 --> 01:11:25,988
Our celebrity. Aren't you busy?

831
01:11:26,088 --> 01:11:27,922
-Have a little break.
-I guess you're not.

832
01:11:28,188 --> 01:11:29,167
Is this all?

833
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:30,400
The place is nice.

834
01:11:30,488 --> 01:11:32,100
Answer me. Isn't there anything else?

835
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,221
There is more.

836
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:39,689
It's my manager.

837
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:42,054
Yes?

838
01:11:42,522 --> 01:11:43,889
A film studio meeting?

839
01:11:44,688 --> 01:11:46,522
Please tell them I can't make it.

840
01:11:47,989 --> 01:11:49,022
Okay.

841
01:11:50,955 --> 01:11:53,767
What are you doing?
This is the home for our new fairies.

842
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,955
Make it clean.

843
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:59,755
-Okay?
-Okay!

844
01:12:32,152 --> 01:12:33,486
Let's call it a day.

845
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:36,870
-Pardon?
-The sun is setting soon.

846
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:38,973
Aren't you going to eat?

847
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,254
I'm starving.

848
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,496
Eat?

849
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:44,968
Sure!

850
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:47,641
I'll be there soon.
Please get something hot ready.

851
01:12:48,829 --> 01:12:50,363
Get the tools!

852
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:51,690
Yes, Father.

853
01:13:27,562 --> 01:13:31,263
So you're starting a new cleaning service?

854
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:32,625
Yes.

855
01:13:34,227 --> 01:13:35,728
How did you know?

856
01:13:36,828 --> 01:13:39,961
That friend of O Dol's,
Yeong Sik or something.

857
01:13:40,394 --> 01:13:41,527
He told me.

858
01:13:45,895 --> 01:13:49,195
Of all jobs, why would
you  want to work with cleaning?

859
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:53,895
As I said before, I still believe in it.

860
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:58,162
The positive effect of cleaning.

861
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:01,806
I love seeing smiles on people's faces...

862
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:04,396
...after cleaning.

863
01:14:05,861 --> 01:14:07,961
I love the energy.

864
01:14:08,828 --> 01:14:09,928
Also,

865
01:14:10,728 --> 01:14:13,928
cleaning is what I'm best at.

866
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:21,995
O Sol told me.

867
01:14:23,161 --> 01:14:24,828
I saw it myself once too.

868
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:28,661
I mean where O Sol's mom is.

869
01:14:31,695 --> 01:14:33,429
Thank you for tidying up the place.

870
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:37,461
It always bothered me. It was a big help.

871
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:39,328
Don't mention it.

872
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:44,428
O Sol...

873
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:47,162
...has been through a lot.

874
01:14:48,561 --> 01:14:50,995
I'm grateful she turned out
well regardless.

875
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,361
I always...

876
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:56,529
...feel sorry for my dear girl.

877
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:28,895
It's been a while.

878
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,106
Today I have the kids with me too.

879
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:35,327
Isn't that nice?

880
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:38,768
Mom, how have you been?

881
01:15:38,857 --> 01:15:40,018
(Jung Hye Won)

882
01:15:40,106 --> 01:15:42,439
Dad doesn't usually take us here.

883
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:45,599
Did he do something wrong?

884
01:15:45,687 --> 01:15:49,354
No. I'm just friends
with the lady at the store.

885
01:15:49,453 --> 01:15:50,324
Mom.

886
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:55,061
I made it to the national team.

887
01:15:56,253 --> 01:15:57,487
Isn't that so cool?

888
01:16:01,486 --> 01:16:03,853
You guys wait outside.

889
01:16:04,787 --> 01:16:06,954
I have something to tell her alone.

890
01:16:07,553 --> 01:16:08,565
All right.

891
01:16:08,653 --> 01:16:09,853
-Okay.
-Let's go.

892
01:16:10,353 --> 01:16:11,653
Have a good time.

893
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:28,659
They're so big now, right?

894
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:32,699
O Dol looks just like me,

895
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:34,854
and O Sol looks like you.

896
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,220
I think...

897
01:16:54,219 --> 01:16:57,553
...I'll forgive them now.

898
01:17:02,386 --> 01:17:05,220
It's not my decision to make, though.

899
01:17:07,353 --> 01:17:10,321
It's all up to you.

900
01:17:17,386 --> 01:17:18,987
I want O Sol...

901
01:17:21,853 --> 01:17:23,754
...to be loved...

902
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,920
...by someone she loves.

903
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:29,521
I don't want her to leave any regrets.

904
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,888
I want her to love...

905
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:37,833
...and be loved...

906
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,753
...as much as she can.

907
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:49,553
Don't you...

908
01:17:51,753 --> 01:17:53,621
...agree?

909
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,354
You're here.

910
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:16,187
How did it go?

911
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,620
What did you tell her?

912
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,387
That guy...

913
01:18:22,586 --> 01:18:24,953
He is persistent, I'll give him that.

914
01:18:25,987 --> 01:18:28,654
So stop keeping him hanging.

915
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,187
He's waited long enough.

916
01:18:32,453 --> 01:18:34,054
What do you mean?

917
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,721
I'm talking about Seon Gyeol.

918
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,520
I think he's a nice guy.

919
01:18:41,486 --> 01:18:43,320
I thought so from the beginning.

920
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,120
Right? He seems nice.

921
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,828
Go to him.

922
01:18:54,586 --> 01:18:55,832
What are you talking about?

923
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,821
I already told your mom.

924
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,120
She is okay with it.

925
01:19:02,054 --> 01:19:03,365
Go see him now.

926
01:19:03,453 --> 01:19:04,907
You don't have to feel bad about it.

927
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:09,753
It's okay.

928
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:12,153
I'm over him now.

929
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,049
I won't see him again.

930
01:19:15,353 --> 01:19:16,404
Are you sure?

931
01:19:17,389 --> 01:19:20,522
All right, suit yourself.

932
01:19:22,054 --> 01:19:24,532
I'll have to go back to
your mom and take it back.

933
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,588
Wait!

934
01:19:28,071 --> 01:19:28,986
That's not...

935
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:33,135
Go on.

936
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:36,687
Go. Don't make him wait any longer.

937
01:20:21,137 --> 01:20:22,270
Ms. Gil.

938
01:20:24,923 --> 01:20:27,857
What brings you here?

939
01:20:39,077 --> 01:20:40,489
Hold on.

940
01:20:40,578 --> 01:20:42,123
I was cleaning.

941
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,345
I'm covered in sweat and dirt.

942
01:20:44,991 --> 01:20:47,458
Let's start over.

943
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:50,120
Let's go back...

944
01:20:50,654 --> 01:20:51,754
...to the beginning.

945
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,388
What is up with the company's name?

946
01:22:38,477 --> 01:22:39,777
Why? I like it.

947
01:22:48,586 --> 01:22:50,786
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

948
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:14,187
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

949
01:23:17,547 --> 01:23:18,422
Clean...

950
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,620
...With Passion...

951
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:26,287
-...For Now!
-...For Now!

952
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,538
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
