00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,067

00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,533
(Kim Yoojung)

00:00:10,033 --> 00:00:12,133
(Yoon Kyunsang)

(Yooseon)

00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:35,002
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,905
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:40,263
Let me borrow it just this once.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,300
What? Borrow what...

10
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,901
What... What's this?

11
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,867
Sir, you woke up!

12
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,933
Mr. Jang woke up. Please hurry here.
Okay.

13
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:16,865
Ms. Kwon,

14
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,796
what happened?

15
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:21,245
Why am I here?

16
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,501
Don't you remember?

17
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,467
I brought you here because
you suddenly fainted.

18
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,896
What? I fainted?

19
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:28,857
Yes.

20
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:34,235
I'm sorry. Let me borrow
it just this once.

21
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,187
What? Borrow what...

22
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,129
Sir,

23
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:50,888
sir!

24
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,133
Are you all right?

25
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,635
Stop! Stop right there. I'm okay.

26
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,434
Don't come closer.

27
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,734
What is going on?

28
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,668
Does Mr. Jang have a serious illness?

29
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,719
-Where are you going?
-What?

30
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,729
Oh, I'm...

31
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:31,989
I was going to...

32
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,434
Hello?

33
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,421
We're still at the office.

34
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,617
Okay. We'll tidy up and get going.

35
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:41,688
All right.

36
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,601
Who was that? Ms. Kwon?
Can we go home now?

37
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:48,135
Let's call it a day, guys.

38
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,586
Oh, wait. What...

39
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:52,413
What's going on with Mr. Jang?

40
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,469
He woke up. She said he's okay
and that we don't need to worry.

41
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,500
No, sir.

42
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:08,968
-The doctor said one more day is...
-There is no need.

43
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,934
I fainted from a mental shock.
How many times I must tell you?

44
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,846
Right, but I need to
know what that shock...

45
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,535
-...was caused by...
-Poop.

46
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:17,806
Sorry?

47
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:19,129
Poop?

48
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:20,608
I was hit by poop.

49
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:24,435
A big chunk of bird
poop fell on my lips...

50
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,455
So just go...

51
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,189
...and start the procedure
for discharge now.

52
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,438
I actually may get sick
if I stay here any longer.

53
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,623
Come in.

54
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,635
Have you completed
the procedure for discharge?

55
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,780
-My gosh!
-Gosh.

56
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:07,068
Why you... What on earth
are you doing here?

57
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:11,224
Well, I... I was just
so worried about you.

58
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,302
-Are you done?
-Done with what?

59
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,734
I was so surprised because
you passed out suddenly.

60
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:28,168
Are you suffering from
an illness by any chance?

61
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,317
Illness?

62
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,612
Can't you see why I passed out?

63
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:32,556
Pardon me?

64
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:34,668
I should know?

65
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you saying...

66
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,125
...it's because of me?

67
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,878
Forget it. Whatever.

68
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,246
What brings you here?
You got something to say?

69
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,901
Then say your piece and get out.

70
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,701
Well, about what happened earlier today...

71
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,168
Thank you.

72
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,435
And I'm sorry.

73
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,834
I wanted to apologize right away,

74
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,101
but you suddenly fainted.

75
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,067
I know it was an unpleasant
experience for you.

76
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,834
I shouldn't have done such a thing,
regardless of the situation.

77
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,901
I did it without thinking.

78
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,798
Do you think an apology would do?

79
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,346
Why do I have to get roped
into your complicated love life...

80
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,135
...and go through all of this? Why?

81
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,300
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,983
I don't even know what to say.

83
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,535
Get out. I can't stand breathing
in the same space with you.

84
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,500
It's gross and disgusting. Okay?

85
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:36,767
Well, sir.

86
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,967
Did you say "disgusting"?

87
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,301
I came all the way here because
I was worried about you.

88
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,079
I must say, that is a bit harsh.

89
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,227
I'm being harsh?

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,135
I mean, have you forgotten what you did?

91
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,235
It was just a kiss...

92
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,300
Well, I mean.

93
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,165
It was just a peck on the lips.
Why make such a fuss over it?

94
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,190
"Just"?

95
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,181
"Just a kiss"?

96
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,434
Listen up, okay?

97
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,146
You hadn't even showered after cleaning.

98
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:12,713
You kissed me when you were
covered in sweat and dust.

99
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:15,713
In other words, germs on your skin
such as staphylococcus aureus,

100
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,294
E. coli, salmonella, and bacteria,

101
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,246
that cause pneumonia and
influenza could've come to me.

102
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:22,001
And bacteria on your dusty
clothes such as Corynebacterium,

103
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,179
Dermabacter, and Roseburia
could have attacked me.

104
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,400
Do you understand?

105
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,202
Ro... Roseburia?

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,501
Come again?

107
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,990
There's more.

108
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,962
Your mouth.

109
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,413
Your mouth is also full of bacteria...

110
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,968
...that can cause dental
cavities and gum infection!

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,968
Thank goodness I passed out
from the psychological shock.

112
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:47,532
What would you have done
if I had died from what happened?

113
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,268
What would you have done?

114
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,135
Gosh,

115
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,965
it's not like I'm a colony of bacteria.

116
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:58,146
Oh, a colony of bacteria.

117
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,813
Yes, you got it. That's what you are.

118
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,602
Why don't you change your name?

119
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:04,343
Instead of Gil O Sol, Gil...

120
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,397
"Gross Gil" would be perfect.

121
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,653
Gross Gil.

122
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,300
What...

123
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,535
-Did you...call me "Gross"?
-Yes, you heard it right.

124
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,768
How could you...

125
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,801
Sir, I've completed
the procedure of discharge...

126
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:27,268
Ms. Gil, when did you get here?
I didn't know you were coming.

127
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,300
Why do you both look upset?

128
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,501
Did something happen?

129
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:50,435
Yes, I just got home too. Yes.

130
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,401
Next week?

131
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:56,001
I think I'll be quite busy next week.

132
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,001
The following week?

133
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:00,746
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

134
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,735
I'm working on my dissertation
at the moment. Yes.

135
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,834
Then I'll be in touch after
my dissertation is published.

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,567
Sure, I had a great time today. Bye.

137
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,813
Do you think I'm crazy?
Why would I be in touch with you?

138
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,502
Gosh, this idiot just can't
read between the lines.

139
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,001
What are you doing?

140
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,133
"Streptococcus mutans."

141
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:31,667
"It's a main contributor to tooth
decay along with lactobacilli."

142
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,979
"Especially during a kiss,"

143
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,579
"exchange of saliva can't be avoided,"

144
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,479
"so one becomes susceptible to
bacterial and viral infections,"

145
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,723
"such as tuberculosis,
syphilis, and rubella."

146
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:43,346
Why on earth are you reading this?

147
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,398
Ju Yeon,

148
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,250
am I that unattractive?

149
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:51,867
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,802
Do I look filthy to you?

151
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:57,013
Do I look like a walking colony of
bacteria? Do I look that gross?

152
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:58,027
"Gross"?

153
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,757
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,713
Actually, maybe sometimes.

155
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,012
-Hey.
-Sorry.

156
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
What's going on?
Are you feeling sick or something?

157
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:09,268
Yes, I'm in pain.
From utter embarrassment.

158
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,601
I'm so humiliated that even my head hurts.

159
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,379
My chest hurts too.
My solar plexus is blocked.

160
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:19,701
I feel like I'm going to die.

161
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,022
What on earth are you talking about?
What's the matter?

162
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,668
Girl, can you elaborate
so that I can understand?

163
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,158
I...

164
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,722
...kissed my boss.

165
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,945
Hey, what... You kissed him?

166
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:40,800
Hey, how?

167
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:42,475
And why?

168
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,135
Did you sleep with him?
Or was it just a kiss?

169
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:47,146
Who hit on whom first?

170
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:49,102
How did you seduce him? Tell me!

171
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:51,867
I kissed him out of the blue.

172
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,801
Oh, my goodness.

173
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:57,068
They say every man has his own trade.

174
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:00,279
O Sol, I didn't know you
could do such a thing.

175
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,934
-Unbelievable.
-Gosh...

176
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,334
I think I've watched too many dramas.

177
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,035
Why? Why do you say that?

178
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,912
Well, I ran into Do Jin earlier today...

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,901
...while I was on the job...

180
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,846
...and honestly, I was so embarrassed.

181
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:20,012
I had told him to never
contact me again ...

182
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,248
...because I was seeing someone
and that I was busy with work.

183
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,467
Then he saw me like that.

184
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,001
And that jerk...

185
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,455
...totally belittled me.

186
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,279
At that utterly humiliating moment,

187
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,667
I saw Mr. Jang walking
toward me from afar.

188
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,679
I see. So you ran to him and kissed him?

189
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,934
-As if he's your boyfriend?
-Yes.

190
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:46,367
Gosh, that's so impressive.

191
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,579
You're crazy in a very cool way.

192
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,146
When you're aiming high,
you have to push forward.

193
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,634
I like your strategy.

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,112
So? What happened after the kiss?

195
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,713
I'm sure it would have
hurt Lee Do Jin's pride.

196
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,413
But what about your boss?

197
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,202
What happened? Tell me everything.

198
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,966
He passed out.

199
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:09,834
What?

200
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,068
He passed out after a kiss?

201
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,801
Apparently, he went into shock
because I was too dirty.

202
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,068
I just visited him from the hospital...

203
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,001
...and he told me to leave,
saying I was unpleasant and filthy.

204
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,302
I'm here after getting kicked out.

205
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,534
I'll destroy him.

206
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:43,001
I'm going to destroy everything!

207
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:47,668
My lips.

208
00:13:13,567 --> 00:13:14,767
What am I doing?

209
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:18,867
Gross Gil.

210
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,068
How dare she kiss me?

211
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,801
My lips.

212
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,713
I've been maintaining
my oral hygiene for 29 years...

213
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:34,934
...and you ruined it all.

214
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:38,634
Gross Gil.

215
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,880
Gross Gil!

216
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,135
I'll destroy you.

217
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,134
I'll never forgive you.

218
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,668
Gross Gil.

219
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,335
Gross Gil!

220
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,437
Hey.

221
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,500
Here comes my girl.

222
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm home.

223
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,959
Dad, where are you going?

224
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,212
What do you think?

225
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:07,814
I'm going to work.

226
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,467
Well, don't forget to lock the doors
before you go to bed.

227
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:17,957
Dad.

228
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,878
Well, I mean...

229
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,902
Be careful.

230
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:32,679
Don't strain yourself.

231
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:34,735
You're silly.

232
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:37,788
Okay. See you.

233
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:41,567
-See you.
-Goodnight.

234
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,901
Gosh, it's cold.

235
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,768
(After promising me a permanent contract,
they fired me unfairly)

236
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,513
You came just now?

237
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,546
Director, hello.

238
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,011
Why did you do that to us?

239
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,346
You broke your promise.

240
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,701
I didn't really have a choice.

241
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,001
Please try to understand me.

242
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:07,879
Director. It's different
from what you promised me.

243
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,402
Director.

244
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,334
It's broken.

245
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,068
You should stop now, Dad.

246
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,534
O Sol.

247
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:41,964
What are you doing here?

248
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:45,300
Let's go home. It's late.

249
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:49,045
My goodness.

250
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,513
(After promising me a permanent contract,
they fired me unfairly)

251
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:53,686
It's okay.

252
00:15:58,567 --> 00:15:59,792
Some people might think...

253
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,535
...I'm making a fuss...

254
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:04,659
...over nothing.

255
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:07,767
But I was able to...

256
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,068
...raise and...

257
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,967
...feed you guys thanks to that workplace.

258
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:16,968
There's nothing else I can do anymore.

259
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,276
Cleaning is the only thing I can do well.

260
00:16:21,702 --> 00:16:23,869
So I had no choice.

261
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,759
You seem to be more naive than I am.

262
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:36,834
If you can get a job back that way,
I would've gotten a job earlier.

263
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,783
I'm making money now.

264
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,202
You can rest at home.

265
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:46,612
Your daughter graduated
college, got a job,

266
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,693
and O Dol is winning competitions.

267
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,668
Why would you worry?

268
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,167
My goodness.

269
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,034
You're all grown up.

270
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:00,780
So...

271
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:03,868
...do you like your workplace?

272
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:07,135
What exactly do you do there?

273
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,134
Well, it's an office job.

274
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,635
All small companies are
pretty much the same.

275
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,233
All right.

276
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,300
My goodness.

277
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,634
You had to quit being an athlete.

278
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,667
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:27,235
There you go again.

280
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,756
How many times do I have to tell you
that I quit because I wanted to?

281
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,646
Having O Dol as the athlete
in the family is enough.

282
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,368
Your mom's death anniversary is coming up.

283
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,602
How am I going to face her like this?

284
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:53,267
I'm so ashamed.

285
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:56,767
Why would you be ashamed?

286
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,067
It's her fault that she left so early.

287
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,001
Why did you have to leave so early?

288
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:15,268
My goodness. Drink slowly, you brat.

289
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:20,279
Who taught you to drink so much?

290
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:21,979
Who do you think?

291
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:24,637
I take after Mom and you.

292
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,435
("Prince Maker" Open Audition)

293
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,446
Mr. Hwang Jae Min.

294
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:35,381
Yes.

295
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,857
I like it.

296
00:18:37,978 --> 00:18:40,278
Please relax and show
us what you prepared.

297
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,467
Okay.

298
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,212
Your chief lives in
Namcheon-dong, doesn't he?

299
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,945
I've eaten a meal with him.
We even went to a sauna together.

300
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,346
Do you know that?

301
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:52,801
Chop here.

302
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:55,044
Here?

303
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,767
No. I mean here.

304
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,432
Thank you very much.

305
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,178
Jae Min.

306
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:18,135
Where did you go,
all dressed up like that?

307
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:19,880
Can't you hear me?

308
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,743
Why are you not answering me?

309
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,768
I told you to leave me alone.

310
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,601
What's with him today?

311
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:35,346
Hey, leave him alone.

312
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:36,601
Jae Min...

313
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,412
...must have failed another audition.

314
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,981
-Give him some time.
-Audition?

315
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,717
-What audition?
-He wants to be an actor.

316
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,018
You didn't know?

317
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:48,454
What?

318
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:50,934
My goodness.

319
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,734
Does he think anyone can be an actor?

320
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,234
Do you think I'm just an "anyone"?

321
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,945
Do I look easy...

322
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,001
...because I'm cleaning and
joking around with you here?

323
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,334
I didn't say that.

324
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,378
It's just that it's not
easy to become an actor.

325
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,535
Why don't you be a bit more
realistic with your goals?

326
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:13,212
-What is being realistic?
-What?

327
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,634
What do you mean by saying be "realistic"?

328
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:17,840
-Well...
-Moving from one job to another,

329
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,546
until you finally get to work
in an office, wearing a shirt?

330
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,279
Getting married to someone,
having children,

331
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,212
and being chased by time
for the rest of your life?

332
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,579
Is that being realistic?

333
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,246
-Why would you say...
-If that's what you mean,

334
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:29,202
you go pursue that yourself!

335
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,713
Chase that girl, Eun Hee
or whatever she's called,

336
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,101
for all your life.

337
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,102
And stop meddling in my life.

338
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,434
Mr. Jang.

339
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,100
I must be crazy.

340
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,485
I must have lost my mind.

341
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,801
Good morning, Mr. Jang.

342
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,684
Yes. Good morning.

343
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,168
What? Well...

344
00:21:38,592 --> 00:21:40,992
You have bread crumbs around your mouth.

345
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,434
What are you, a kid? You're so clumsy.

346
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,835
Why is he picking a fight
so early in the morning?

347
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,501
Hey, Hwang Jae Min.

348
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm sorry about yesterday.

349
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,901
Don't get upset over that like a sissy.

350
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,668
I told you not to bother me.

351
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,767
It was my first time seeing someone
who wanted to be an actor.

352
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,234
When you told me it was your dream,
I was very impressed.

353
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:34,675
I thought you just liked to
idle around all the time.

354
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,301
After I quit being an athlete,
I never thought about my future.

355
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,446
Don't hold a grudge.

356
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:45,868
-You're making me embarrassed.
-I saw...

357
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,024
...your resume at the company yesterday.

358
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,463
Born in 1998, the Year of the Tiger?

359
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,307
1998, the Year of the Tiger.

360
00:22:56,133 --> 00:22:58,312
Well... Something went wrong
with my family registration.

361
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,813
Family registration my foot,
you little punk.

362
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,268
You better not act up around me anymore.

363
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:06,057
You little...

364
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,151
Got it?

365
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:12,424
He wasn't mad because of that.
Hey, Hwang Jae Min!

366
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,034
Wait for me, sir.

367
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:39,115
-Ta-da! Mr. Jang.
-Gross Gil?

368
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,100
-What on earth...
-Mr. Jang!

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,767
Mr. Jang.

370
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,509
-Don't come near me.
-Mr. Jang.

371
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,869
I'm going to spray this on you!

372
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,300
You didn't even brush your teeth!

373
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,734
-Mr. Jang.
-Get lost!

374
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,713
No! Don't come near me.

375
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,702
-Don't do this to me!
-Mr. Jang.

376
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,234
Mr. Jang.

377
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,600
Mr. Jang!

378
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,801
Mr. Jang!

379
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,613
I'm sorry. I'll exterminate you!

380
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:19,502
I'm going to kill you! Get lost!

381
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,035
Exterminate!

382
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,406
Mr. Jang?

383
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,897
What's wrong so early in the morning?

384
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,842
Are you alright?

385
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:48,421
Yes.

386
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:04,968
Is it raining?

387
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
-You got water on me.
-Sorry.

388
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,130
Take that!

389
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,701
Jeon Yeong Sik!

390
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,713
-You bored?
-Don't do it. I'm telling you...

391
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,901
Don't do it!

392
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,467
Take that!

393
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:42,834
Come over here.

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,433
Come here.

395
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:45,834
Take that!

396
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:56,302
Hey! You better get here!

397
00:25:56,534 --> 00:25:58,201
Come here! Right now!

398
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:47,834
I got you!

399
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,834
I envy their youth.

400
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,701
It's quite chilly now.

401
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:55,001
But they seem really
happy, don't you think?

402
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,208
Do you even know how many people...

403
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:01,931
...are dying from lack of water
around the world? My goodness.

404
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:04,923
You should train our employees better.

405
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:06,388
How can they...

406
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:08,972
...have a water fight
during working hours?

407
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:14,019
If you saved the water you use
for your 4-hour-long showers,

408
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:16,742
it'll be really helpful
to the worldwide water scarcity problem.

409
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,810
I'm sorry, but what did you just say?

410
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,868
Did I just say something?

411
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,808
Hwang Jae Min!

412
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,254
No!

413
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,229
Mr. Jang! No!

414
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:55,651
Mr... Mr. Jang.

415
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,210
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch me!

416
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,117
You make me feel filthy.

417
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:10,502
Darn it!

418
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:13,918
Filthy?

419
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,963
Why does he always say
that when he sees me?

420
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,764
Does he think he's clean or something?

421
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,880
What do I do?

422
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:35,122
No matter how angry you were,

423
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,924
it was a bit harsh to tell
her that she was filthy.

424
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:38,951
Why?

425
00:28:39,972 --> 00:28:43,639
I saw something filthy and stated a fact.
Is that wrong?

426
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,567
Aren't you going home?

427
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,663
I'll be going then.

428
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,868
Was there an incident
between him and O Sol?

429
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,313
He seems unusually sensitive.

430
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:08,522
Was I too harsh on her?

431
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,427
I don't know.

432
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,526
He totally hates me now.

433
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:25,059
If I knew this would happen,
I would've never done that.

434
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,817
I regret it too.

435
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:34,847
Wait. Is she crying?

436
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,943
How could I not regret it?

437
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:43,009
Miss Gil?

438
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:44,516
Hang on.

439
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:46,704
Yes?

440
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:55,734
Wait...

441
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:28,393
What is this?

442
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:34,202
Mr. Jang?

443
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,134
What are you doing here?

444
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:41,173
What?

445
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:46,352
I'm sorry.

446
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,667
-Miss Gil.
-Yes?

447
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:51,609
What are those blue sheets?

448
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:56,236
These?

449
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,702
These are called...

450
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,736
sebum...sebum papers.

451
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,075
Sebum?

452
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,431
See?

453
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:10,198
This is...

454
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:13,390
...very handy when getting
rid of face grease.

455
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:14,718
You know, right?

456
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,133
Do you want one?

457
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,134
You can use it on your cheek.

458
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:21,198
It gets rid of your grease.

459
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:26,467
This one is clean.

460
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,234
Get this off. Get this off me!

461
00:32:11,234 --> 00:32:12,267
Go away!

462
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:15,868
Sebum, gross sebum.

463
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,546
What did you do to my forehead, Gil O Sol?

464
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,968
Gil O Sol, Gil O Sol!

465
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,400
No.

466
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:37,335
Gil O Sol! My forehead has
been contaminated by sebum.

467
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,720
(Revelation of the Youth)

468
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,758
("Almost Transparent Blue")

469
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:18,407
This is very handy when
getting rid of face grease.

470
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:21,235
Would you like one, sir?

471
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:42,363
I must've lost my mind.
I think I'm going crazy.

472
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,500
I think his condition
has been worsening...

473
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,932
...ever since he fainted last time.

474
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:58,829
He brushes his teeth...

475
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:01,430
...multiple times a day to the point
when his gum starts bleeding.

476
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:02,891
Seon Gyeol fainted?

477
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,016
It wasn't anything serious.

478
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,949
He said he was hit by bird poop.

479
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:09,305
Bird poop?

480
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,662
My goodness.

481
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:13,096
Gosh.

482
00:34:13,282 --> 00:34:17,061
What if he now wants to get rid of
all the pigeons on the streets?

483
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,217
No way.

484
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,846
Trust me.

485
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,360
He's certainly capable of
doing something like that.

486
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,908
I bet he wants to sew up
the buttholes of all the pigeons.

487
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:30,377
Well, you remember the doctor
that treated him...

488
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:33,033
...when he was in the US, right?

489
00:34:34,163 --> 00:34:36,797
I heard that doctor's
student is in Korea now.

490
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:37,961
Do you know anything?

491
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,217
You mean...

492
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:42,398
...the doctor at Rochester Clinic?

493
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:43,321
Yes.

494
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:46,008
I heard Mr. Jang's condition...

495
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:48,464
...was much more stable
when he was in the US.

496
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:49,913
Yes, it was.

497
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,091
But he reverted to the old state
after the doctor passed away.

498
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,053
I heard that him starting
the cleaning business...

499
00:34:56,142 --> 00:34:58,263
...was a way of letting it out
in a positive manner.

500
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,612
How could the doctor pass away
after turning him into this mess?

501
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,899
Gosh, that old man.

502
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:06,629
That being said,

503
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:10,626
how about we introduce him to Mr. Jang?

504
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:13,478
You mean, that doctor's student?

505
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:16,880
I heard it's next to impossible
to get his contact information.

506
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:24,096
I'd really appreciate it
if you could do that.

507
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:29,862
Gosh, my legs.

508
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:35,996
My legs hurt.

509
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:43,663
Excuse me, can I help you?

510
00:35:46,029 --> 00:35:49,530
Does a young man named Choi Ha In
live here by any chance?

511
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:52,550
Choi Ha In?

512
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:54,768
Who is Choi Ha In?

513
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:57,274
I heard he moved here recently.

514
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:58,562
He moved here recently?

515
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,626
Oh, that jobless guy on the rooftop?

516
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,223
His name is Choi Ha In?

517
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,512
Gosh, that name does not suit him at all.

518
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:12,829
Are you here to get your
fortune told as well?

519
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:14,328
Sorry?

520
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,304
Don't even bother.

521
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,817
He's a fraud. His readings
aren't accurate at all.

522
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,545
An important person in
the northeast, my foot.

523
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:25,834
Don't waste your time, okay?

524
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:28,836
My gosh.

525
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:34,285
Dr. Baek.

526
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:35,319
Choi.

527
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,084
What brings you here?

528
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:38,730
So I've come to the right place.

529
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,357
-Long time no see.
-Yes, it's been so long.

530
00:37:11,994 --> 00:37:13,061
Here you go.

531
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:21,913
Panama Geisha.

532
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,912
It's my favorite.

533
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:32,240
Has it been exactly a year?

534
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,930
You look much better now.

535
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,330
You too.

536
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,836
You seem quite relaxed now.

537
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,462
I was very worried about you.

538
00:37:44,939 --> 00:37:45,977
Are you still...

539
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:48,608
...busy with your patients?

540
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:50,144
Things are still the same for me.

541
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:52,796
Regardless of what people say,

542
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,669
someone has to do the job, you know.

543
00:38:21,462 --> 00:38:23,247
Gosh, seriously.

544
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,716
Who is he, really?

545
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:30,129
I thought he was a total
womanizer and a gigolo,

546
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:32,052
but he acted like a fortune-teller.

547
00:38:32,303 --> 00:38:34,171
So I thought he was a
psychic or something,

548
00:38:34,505 --> 00:38:35,880
but what is this now?

549
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,804
Oh, did you get everything done?

550
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,664
Yes, I did. Thank you.

551
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,494
Wait, may I ask...

552
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,892
...how you know the man who lives here?

553
00:38:52,981 --> 00:38:54,178
Why do you ask?

554
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,440
Well, I was just curious.

555
00:38:58,581 --> 00:38:59,681
I apologize.

556
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:01,440
Due to the Personal
Information Protection Act,

557
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:03,541
I cannot disclose any
information about my patients.

558
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:05,595
"Patient"?

559
00:39:12,724 --> 00:39:14,003
He's one of my patients...

560
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:16,693
I've been looking after for a long time.

561
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:20,673
What doctor visits his patient
at his home like this?

562
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:22,263
Wait, Doctor.

563
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,407
Which area do you specialize in?

564
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:28,595
Me? I'm...

565
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,115
...a neuropsychiatrist, Dr. Baek.

566
00:39:31,429 --> 00:39:32,496
I have to go.

567
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:36,445
A neuropsychiatrist?

568
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:40,645
Gosh, I knew it.

569
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:43,186
He didn't seem to be sane.

570
00:39:45,328 --> 00:39:46,395
Poor guy.

571
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,735
Good morning!

572
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:06,896
He's still so young.
I feel really bad for him.

573
00:40:09,796 --> 00:40:12,630
She seems to be in a good mood today.

574
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:16,330
High five?

575
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:40,996
My old doctor's student is in Korea?

576
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,263
Your condition seems to be getting worse.

577
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:47,497
Meeting him for a consultation
might be helpful.

578
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,196
Is that what my mother
wanted you to tell me?

579
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:52,879
Did she ask you to persuade me...

580
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,169
...to see a doctor?

581
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,674
No, sir. It's not that.

582
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:59,129
I know my condition
better than anybody else.

583
00:41:01,096 --> 00:41:02,206
Ms. Kwon,

584
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,171
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
treat me like someone who's ill.

585
00:41:06,362 --> 00:41:08,562
I apologize if I made you feel that way.

586
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:13,104
But I can't help but worry
about you these days.

587
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,284
I think you've gotten more sensitive.

588
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:21,864
I went through hoops to get
his contact information.

589
00:41:22,529 --> 00:41:24,763
I'll leave it here just in case.

590
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:28,596
You can discard it if you don't need it.

591
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:54,036
Did they even brush their teeth?

592
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:14,732
Snap out of it, Seon Gyeol.
What are you...

593
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:23,251
Mr. Jang.

594
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,461
It's okay.

595
00:42:38,994 --> 00:42:40,304
I can see a doctor.

596
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,267
That's right.

597
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,050
Chairman Cha, here's the newspaper.

598
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:42,200
Please leave it there.

605
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:48,306
Gosh!

606
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:51,429
What's with you? You can't just
barge into my room like this.

607
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:54,629
It's not okay to do that
especially in the morning.

608
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:57,530
Get out! Out!

609
00:44:58,204 --> 00:44:59,471
I can't believe it!

610
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:09,491
Here.

611
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:10,929

It's nothing. Don't mind her and eat up.

614

It's that day again.

The day that comes every year.

617
00:45:38,395 --> 00:45:40,662
Thank you. I'm leaving.

621
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,960

O Sol loves this drink.

My wife used to make sure
we never ran out of them.

624

Sometimes, we'd freeze them.

And sometimes not.

...cleans the whole house
and puts on makeup.

632
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:55,450
She makes such a fuss.

633
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,515
It's as if she's doing it to show
her mom that we're doing good...

634
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:48,771
...and that she doesn't have to worry.

635
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:53,411
I feel proud...

636
00:47:54,214 --> 00:47:55,548
...and sorry at the same time.

637
00:47:58,257 --> 00:47:59,324
It's like that.

depending on makeup and clothes.

You look a bit different today.

640

O Sol, you look gorgeous.

641
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:31,718
Why don't you do this more often?

642
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:35,880
Well, I don't usually
dress up, but when I do,

643
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:38,356
I look way better than
any girl group member.

644
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:40,985
Is it a special day today?

645
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:42,809
Are you going somewhere?

646
00:48:43,835 --> 00:48:45,202
That's not it.

647
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,119
Let's start cleaning.

648
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:50,129
-Good morning, Mr. Jang.
-Good morning.

Ms. Gil.

650
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:26,570
Are you going on a blind date?

651
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:30,732
Sorry?

652
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:32,630
Are you going somewhere after work?

653
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,125
What is wrong with that outfit?

654
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:40,440
"Wrong"?

655
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:43,941
Yes. That outfit seems...

656
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:47,693
...very elegant...

657
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:49,415
...but tacky.

658
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,427
What did you say?

659
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,763
Aren't you going to change?

660
00:49:58,068 --> 00:49:59,302

661

00:50:53,665 --> 00:50:56,299
It's similar to post-traumatic
stress disorder...

665
00:50:56,638 --> 00:51:00,205
...and dissociative disorder that
shows up together with stress.

666
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,394
What do you mean by
"dissociative disorder"?

667
00:51:03,482 --> 00:51:06,327
You said that woman always
appears in front of your eyes.

668
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:08,350
She pops out all the time...

669
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:10,436
...and torments you, right?

670
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:15,002
Yes, it's horrible. What's worse is...

671
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:18,529
...her appearance looks very dirty...

672
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:20,361
...and filthy whenever I see her.

673
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:23,649
Any unwanted physical contact
must've been hard to handle...

674
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,417
...since you have an obsessive
compulsive personality disorder.

675
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:31,250
I believe those symptoms started
after experiencing that incident.

676
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:37,749
But in most cases, the symptoms
will disappear within four weeks...

677
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:41,682
...and you'll be able to return to normal.

678
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:42,833
So...

679
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:45,918
...there's no need to be worried.

680
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:47,666
However,

681
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:50,870
...there is one exception.

682
00:52:14,655 --> 00:52:15,688
What are you doing?

683
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:17,348
It's nothing.

684
00:52:30,182 --> 00:52:32,349
Hold on. Why am I hiding?

685
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:45,482
Hello, we are Cleaning Fairies.

686
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:46,649
Welcome.

687
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:54,749
Wow.

688
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,728
You must really like collecting figures.

689
00:52:56,816 --> 00:52:58,116
Oh, yes.

690
00:52:58,748 --> 00:52:59,982
This one is totally expensive.

691
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:05,483
They are very rare items,
so I hope you're careful.

692
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:07,557
Oh, right.

693
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:08,916
I understand.

694
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:11,871
Is this your whole figure collection?

695
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,615
I heard you requested only
to clean your figures today.

696
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:17,702
You can follow me.

697
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:46,316
It was too difficult for me
to clean them on my own.

698
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:48,361
Even if it costs me money,

699
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:51,050
I thought it'd be better to
leave it up to the specialists.

700
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:19,715
Hold on.

701
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:23,016
You can't grab this one like that.

702
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:24,682
A little lower.

703
00:54:31,671 --> 00:54:33,572
You have to brush his head a bit more.

704
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:34,839
It looks the same to me.

705
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:36,349
Yes, sir.

706
00:54:56,924 --> 00:54:58,425
I can't breathe in here.

707
00:54:59,268 --> 00:55:01,468
No wonder things were
seemingly going smooth today.

708
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:04,683
Wow, this thing is so detailed.

709
00:55:04,782 --> 00:55:07,249
I can bend all its joints,
and it seems real.

710
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:10,574
You might break it if you keep
touching it with your clumsy hands.

711
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:13,783
That dude seems really
obsessive, so just put it down.

712
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:19,617
We need more water and
detergent in this basket.

713
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:21,448
I'll go get some more.

714
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:57,494
Do you remember the disaster
in Jungang-dong six years ago,

715
00:55:57,582 --> 00:56:00,327
which resulted in 4
deaths and 20 injuries?

716
00:56:00,415 --> 00:56:02,594
This incident resulted
in a controversy regarding...

717
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:05,561
...the use of force against
residents and demonstrators.

718
00:56:05,649 --> 00:56:07,795
I am in front of the buildings
that were once called...

719
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,648
...the landmark of Jungang-dong.

720
00:56:09,737 --> 00:56:12,683
Now, we cannot find any signs
of the disaster that occurred...

721
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,017
...six years ago at this
construction redevelopment site.

722
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:17,628
However, no compensation nor
sincere apologies were given...

723
00:56:17,716 --> 00:56:19,060
...to the families of the deceased...

724
00:56:19,148 --> 00:56:21,127
...due to the disputes between...

725
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,682
...the government and
the construction company.

726
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:26,828
It's been six painful years
suddenly losing a loved one...

727
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,717
...to the families of the deceased.

728
00:56:28,983 --> 00:56:32,095
It's time to wipe the tears of all
the families who are in grief...

729
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:35,651
...through an investigation that will
reveal the truth and press charges.

730
00:56:35,883 --> 00:56:37,294
This is JTBC News.

731
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:39,463
O Sol, what are you doing, standing there?

732
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:40,983
Give that to me.

733
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,664
It's okay, I'll go.

734
00:56:47,816 --> 00:56:49,983
O Sol, are you okay?

735
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:52,516
I'm okay.

736
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:59,350
No!

737
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:02,382
I can't believe this.

738
00:57:02,649 --> 00:57:04,749
This can't be.
Do you know how much this costs?

739
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:07,649
It's a limited edition that's
not even sold in this country.

740
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:10,549
What is this doing here? I'm sorry.

741
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:13,048
O Sol.

742
00:57:16,315 --> 00:57:17,576
Are you okay, O Sol?

743
00:57:18,382 --> 00:57:19,949
Are you crazy?

744
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,050
You jerk.

745
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:23,895
Come over here.

746
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,194
Let go of me right now.

747
00:57:25,282 --> 00:57:27,027
How could you hit her
over something like that?

748
00:57:27,115 --> 00:57:28,227
Calm down.

749
00:57:28,315 --> 00:57:29,582
What are you going to do about this?

750
00:57:30,516 --> 00:57:32,050
How will you compensate me?

751
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:36,361
Sir, you should calm down first.

752
00:57:36,449 --> 00:57:38,749
Do you think I can calm
down in this situation?

753
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:41,950
What are you going to do about this?

754
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:50,327
I'm sorry. Since this is my mistake,

755
00:57:50,415 --> 00:57:51,916
I'll compensate you in any way I can.

756
00:57:52,349 --> 00:57:54,984
Compensate? You can't afford
this with your paycheck.

757
00:57:55,073 --> 00:57:57,273
This item is priceless!

758
00:57:58,749 --> 00:57:59,994
Forget it, and bring the CEO.

759
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:01,516
Bring the CEO right now!

760
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:09,186
I'm sorry.

761
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:13,494
You can pay for this and
cut it from my paycheck...

762
00:58:13,582 --> 00:58:17,183
Do you think we can solve this
by taking it off your paycheck?

763
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:21,383
Do you know how hard it was for me
to persuade that picky client?

764
00:58:22,782 --> 00:58:24,616
You want to solve this with money?

765
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:26,737
Miss Gil.

766
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:28,883
Do you have money?

767
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:33,440
You haven't even paid me back
for the car accident last time.

768
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:36,383
Yet, you want to solve it with money?

769
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:41,483
What's the big deal with
breaking a darn toy?

770
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:44,428
You can take it from my
paycheck if it isn't enough.

771
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:45,916
Won't that be enough?

772
00:58:47,215 --> 00:58:48,287
Can I...

773
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:50,127
...pitch in too?

774
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:53,315
I'm sorry, sir. I should've been
more careful as the team leader.

775
00:58:57,282 --> 00:59:00,548
You guys seem to boast some
amazing teamwork, don't you?

776
00:59:02,649 --> 00:59:03,816
Fine then.

777
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:05,594
If you all insist,

778
00:59:05,682 --> 00:59:09,815
I'll open a disciplinary committee
for all of you about this incident.

779
00:59:10,094 --> 00:59:11,004
Are you satisfied?

780
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,194
No, sir.

781
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,852
The other team members did nothing wrong.

782
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:18,027
Since this is my mistake,

783
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:20,294
I'll take responsibility for it,
no matter what it takes.

784
00:59:20,382 --> 00:59:22,883
No. Didn't we all work together?

785
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:24,578
Yes.

786
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:26,194
You're right.

787
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:28,248
-Sir...
-Everyone, stop talking.

788
00:59:29,883 --> 00:59:31,684
I understand what you mean.

789
00:59:32,564 --> 00:59:35,165
I want you all to leave the room
except for Ms. Gil.

790
00:59:42,782 --> 00:59:44,349
Didn't you hear me?

791
00:59:53,682 --> 00:59:55,082
Gosh, let go.

792
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:03,116
Ms. Gil.

793
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:07,828
You made a mistake like this...

794
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:09,949
...because you're all distracted
by your love life.

795
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,308
What's going on this time?

796
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:14,721
That outfit and makeup
don't even suit you.

797
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:17,383
Do you have a blind date
after work or what?

798
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:22,016
Or were you going to hit on a client
who seems to be a good catch?

799
01:00:23,415 --> 01:00:24,515
Sir.

800
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:29,623
You're out of line.

801
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:30,558
Why?

802
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:32,768
Am I wrong?

803
01:00:34,082 --> 01:00:36,449
You don't even know your place
and hit on every guy you see.

804
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:38,482
Isn't that your specialty?

805
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,114
You made this stupid mistake
because you were distracted.

806
01:00:45,115 --> 01:00:47,227
You completely ruined
the company's reputation,

807
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:49,448
which my employees have
worked so hard to build.

808
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,016
Do you even realize it?

809
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,623
I'm sorry.

810
01:01:01,682 --> 01:01:03,183
You're saying sorry again.

811
01:01:06,516 --> 01:01:08,539
I can't even stand the sight of you,
so get out this instant.

812
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:14,109
Get out of my office and
my company right now!

813
01:02:21,115 --> 01:02:22,215
You're ready, right?

814
01:02:22,616 --> 01:02:24,450
Start!

815
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:48,231
The winner can have Eun Hee.

816
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:51,816
Don't forget.
We made a man-to-man promise.

817
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,472
I told you it's dangerous
to clean like that.

818
01:02:57,561 --> 01:02:59,295
Mind your own business, will you?

819
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,714
Glass must be cleaned with newspaper.

820
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:07,816
Gosh, help!

821
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:15,051
Help me.

822
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:17,994
Please save me. I'm scared.

823
01:03:18,098 --> 01:03:19,591
-Hold my hand.
-Gosh.

824
01:03:41,313 --> 01:03:42,169
Are you all right?

825
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,868
Gosh, you idiot.

826
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:46,306
Who cleans like that? It was so dangerous.

828
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:04,194
Someone always leaves yogurt here
on my mom's death anniversary.

829
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:06,121
It's such a little thing,
but it gives me solace.

830
01:04:06,282 --> 01:04:07,761
Then let's try this.

831
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:10,327
"Am I okay with only
that person touching me?"

832
01:04:10,415 --> 01:04:12,994
Find out if you're fine with
others touching you as well.

833
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,583
Other people can't, but only she can?

834
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:16,997
That is crazy.

835
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,561
Did you meet her?

836
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:19,816
She's a wonderful person,

837
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:21,773
and I want to protect her.

838
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,363
The place Ms. Gil is cleaning now.
What's the address?

839
01:04:24,452 --> 01:04:27,108
Send me our customer blacklist right away.
