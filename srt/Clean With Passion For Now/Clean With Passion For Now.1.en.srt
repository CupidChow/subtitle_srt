(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,569
Let me play with you.

8
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,741
I want to play too.

9
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,235
(UV Rays, Humidity)

10
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:17,725
What do you think, Geum Ja?

11
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:21,778
Do I look alright?

12
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,247
(Jang Seon Gyeol)

(Towels in the bathroom,
fingerprints on a butter knife,)

00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:42,911
(dressing room needs to be cleaned)

16
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:29,523
Wait in line!

17
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:31,290
-Wait for your turn.
-Don't push.

18
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,045
-Stop pushing!
-Let me get inside.

19
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,745
-Gosh, seriously.
-Come on!

20
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,690
-Excuse me.
-The world we live in,

21
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:51,878
is filled with many people,
always bumping into each other.

22
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:56,687
We have no idea who grabs...

23
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:59,838
...the handle of the subway
or bus we were in today.

24
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:04,081
We breathe in air exhaled by others...

25
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,578
...and stay in locations
others used to stand in.

26
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,505
To modern people, this is
just ordinary everyday life,

27
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,525
but are you sure there's
no problem with this?

28
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,166
The quarantine system of this
country needs to be changed.

29
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,112
It's such a dangerous world.

30
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,211
Goodness.

31
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:48,403
People are so insensitive to safety.
They're not even wearing masks.

32
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,209
Gosh, what a filthy way to start the day.

33
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,795
How gross.

34
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,452
This huge world we're living in...

35
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,867
...is full of many different
kinds of people...

36
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:15,338
...as well as bacteria and
viruses that cause diseases.

37
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,240
We must protect ourselves...

38
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:19,996
...from all kinds of
bacteria and viruses...

39
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,608
...that can threaten our survival.

40
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,078
Like me.

41
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,793

to others will be expelled!)

43

("It's lucky to experience
many hardships.")

44
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,982
(You can do it, Gil O Sol. Go for it!)

45
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,915
-I'd like to pay for this month.
-Sure.

46
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,749
-I'm Park So Hye.
-Okay.

47
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,484
Here you go. Thank you.

48
00:08:03,494 --> 00:08:05,108
-You're hungry, right?
-Yes.

49
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,791
Look at you. It's good, isn't it?

50
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,348
The youth unemployment
rate is skyrocketing.

51
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:13,049
-Must they do this here?
-You have something here.

52
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:17,816
-People will see us.
-No, they won't.

53
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,892
You are the only person who
can protect yourself...

54
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,797
...in this dangerous world.

55
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:29,405
And I realized it a little
earlier than others usually do.

56
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:30,829
Money and time.

57
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:34,923
If you invest your everything
and successfully land a job...

58
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,685
...or pass the exam
that you've been studying hard for...

59
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:39,919
...will you be truly satisfied?

60
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:41,888
In 2017,

61
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,731
27.7 percent of bachelor's
degree holders...

62
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,292
...left their jobs within a year.

63
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,915
-There were many reasons for this.
-Hey, look at Jang Seon Gyeol.

64
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:53,033
-Isn't he so handsome?
-Yes, he looks like a K-pop star.

65
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,834
He probably has a girlfriend, right?

66
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,016
I'm sure he does.
I mean, look at his face.

67
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:59,559
Gosh, I wish I was his girlfriend.

68
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,027
Look at his fair skin and
perfectly defined nose.

69
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:03,760
My, he's so good-looking.

70
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:07,191
Even right now, I'm sure many of
you are studying books like...

71
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,593
"Passing Civil Service Exams"
and "How to Land a Job".

72
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,026
Let me ask you, the youth of this country.

73
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:14,513
Is that...

74
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:17,925
...really where you belong?

75
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,363
Figure out what you really want...

76
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,861
...and what you can excel in.

77
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,130
That should be the starting point.

78
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:28,050
-What? He's totally bluffing away.
-Don't let others' judgment...

79
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:29,706
-...and standards...
-Yeah, right.

80
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,939
...confine your precious future.

81
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,407
Just like how I started working on
what I wanted to do the most...

82
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,683
...and knew I'd excel at,
a cleaning business.

83
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,448
-My gosh!
-Oh, my!

84
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,848
-Gosh!
-Please look at me!

85
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,482
-Here!
-My gosh!

86
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:21,982
Oh, my.

87
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,841
Gosh, they're coming.

88
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,728
Hey. You're here, Ju Yeon.

89
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,257
Wait, move.

90
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:34,234
-I'm admiring a work of art.
-What?

91
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:35,849
What's going on?

92
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:37,427
What's all that fuss about?

93
00:10:37,516 --> 00:10:40,393
What do you think?
They're Cleaning Fairies.

94
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,010
Cleaning Fairies?

95
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,078
Well, you know. They're all
over social media these days.

96
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,609
It's a cleaning service that hires
super hot guys. You don't know?

97
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,014
They even advertise on
home shopping channels.

98
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:53,522
How would I know those things?

99
00:10:56,172 --> 00:11:00,239
My gosh, I'd love to touch those biceps.

100
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,996
They must be rock-hard, right?

101
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:13,573
What's going on?
Why are you in a total daze?

102
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,239
Hey, hang in there.

103
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:17,506
It'll be over for you soon.

104
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,170
Don't tell me that you still
have a crush on Do Jin.

105
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,446
To me, Do Jin is like...

106
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,919
...an oasis in the desert.

107
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:30,990
The only thing that gives me solace
in this grim, depressing reality.

108
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,283
Cut it out, will you?

109
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:35,495
Hey, you see...

110
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:39,273
As soon as I get a job,
I'll confess my feelings to him.

111
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:40,462
I'll tell him that I like him.

112
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,305
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:45,583
You can do whatever you want,

114
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,340
but can you please get changed first?

115
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:49,864
I thought you were standing
with your knees bent,

116
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,611
because the knees are bagging out so much.

117
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,361
Answer honestly.

118
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,228
When was the last time you washed it?

119
00:11:56,086 --> 00:11:57,917
Gosh, who cares?

120
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,148
Goodness, I guess she can't even remember.

121
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,922
Hey, I bet the pants can stand
on its own even without you.

122
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,182
-Stop nagging me.
-Oh, right.

123
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,285
I heard Do Jin got a job at
a home shopping network.

124
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:09,963
What? He got a job?

125
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,067
Thank you for listening.
This was Jang Seon Gyeol.

126
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,864
Many positive comments
were posted real-time.

127
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:48,234
We also got an interview request
from a magazine during the lecture.

128
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,304
I don't think I need any
more TV appearance.

129
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,471
I've already let them know that you
won't do any more TV interviews.

130
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:57,140
I disinfected the table
in the waiting room again.

131
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:59,733
I left your clothes on top of the table.

132
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:02,339
Do you need to head back
to the office right away?

133
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:04,528
Yes, sir. There are some things
that I have to take care of.

134
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,070
By the way, are you happy
with your new housekeeper?

135
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,323
Well, not bad.

136
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,483
I can't say I'm completely satisfied,

137
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:14,894
but just one sticky note isn't too bad.

138
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,462
I went through hoops
to find that housekeeper.

139
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,465
I hope that person stays for a long time.

140
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:21,701
I hope so too.

141
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,337
I also hope...

142
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,795
...that things go well with
the lady you're meeting today.

143
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:54,449
Sir, would you like me to
wipe the table again for you?

144
00:13:54,538 --> 00:13:57,470
-No, it's okay. I'll do it.
-Okay.

145
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:21,652
-Isn't she a news anchor?
-Really?

146
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,239
Kim Hye Won. She's Kim Hye Won.

147
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,799
She's so pretty.

148
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,511
Seon Gyeol.

149
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,104
Oh, Hye Won.

150
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,942
You beat me. And you even got changed.

151
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,075
Have a seat.

152
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:46,030
It's nice to see you outside the studio.

153
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,816
It was being broadcast live,
but you weren't nervous at all.

154
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:51,805
You were better than me,
a professional anchor.

155
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,905
It's all because you guided me well.

156
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,916
People call you a veteran
host for a reason.

157
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:59,065
Are you complimenting me now?

158
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:00,904
I'm flattered.

159
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,137
It looks like she takes
good care of herself.

160
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:18,838
Well...

161
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:22,621
Why don't we go somewhere else...

162
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:28,417
Are you all right?

163
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,716
-Excuse me, could you bring...
-No, wait.

164
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,664
I'm fine.

165
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,339
I got this.

166
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,129
Okay.

167
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:41,340
I forgot that I had an important
appointment. I'm sorry.

168
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:43,805
Pardon? Earlier, you said
you have no other plans.

169
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,481
I'm sorry. I'll be in touch.

170
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,203
Oh, okay. You don't have my number, right?

171
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:53,157
Where's my business card?

172
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:00,575
What just happened?
He's gone?

173
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,057
He left... Without me?

174
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:06,156
Why?

175
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,862
My goodness, she probably hasn't
cleaned out her ears in so long.

176
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:21,310
Geum Ja, you would've
jumped on her if you had seen it.

177
00:16:36,368 --> 00:16:38,171
Hey! Jang Seon Gyeol!

178
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:40,689
What are you doing here?
How did you come in?

179
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,978
She swiped your extra keys the other day.

180
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:44,951
Her hands are so fast.

181
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,428
So what's the problem this time?

182
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:48,869
Cuticles? Dead skin? Hair?

183
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,496
What is it?

184
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:52,183
I said I don't want to see anyone.

185
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:53,183
That's not true.

186
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,559
It's not that you don't want to.
You just can't.

187
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:58,840
Do you have any idea how hard
it was to arrange that date?

188
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,841
You said you were interested.

189
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,871
You said she'd take good care of
herself since she's a news anchor.

190
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,846
-So what is it?
-Earwax.

191
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,855
Her huge, yellow earwax caught my eyes.
How could I date her?

192
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,053
Earwax?

193
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,456
She had earwax?

194
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,053
She looked so neat on TV.

195
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:18,697
I understand him this time.

196
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,115
Hey. Do you have no earwax?

197
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,283
All humans have it.

198
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:24,683
There have even been studies that say,

199
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,583
it's actually better for your
health not to remove your earwax.

200
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,799
There have been articles too.

201
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:28,833
So what's the problem?

202
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,566
I'm tired. Please leave.

203
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,021
Call Hye Won tomorrow.

204
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,281
Apologize to her and set up another date.

205
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,737
I'm busy. I have to work early tomorrow.

206
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,972
Why would you work so hard
for a cleaning company?

207
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,864
A convenience store would
be better than that.

208
00:17:43,304 --> 00:17:44,337
It's embarrassing.

209
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:47,454
But its sales has reached
10 million dollars.

210
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:48,768
You shouldn't really say that.

211
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,114
Then again, compared to AG Group,
it is like a convenience store.

212
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,148
Why didn't you close the door?

213
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,088
How many times do I have to
tell you it'll let dust inside?

214
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,552
Geum Ja?

215
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,583
You could easily inherit the company.

216
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:18,032
What is on your mind?

217
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,558
Have you seen Geum Ja?

218
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:20,496
What?

219
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,534
Geum Ja?

220
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,628
Who's that?

221
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,574
Were you hiding a girl somewhere?

222
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:29,677
Is that it?

223
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:31,200
Forget it.

224
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:33,776
Seon Gyeol! Seon Gyeol!

225
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,750
Do Jin, congratulations on your new job.

226
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,519
Is that too boring?

227
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,508
Do Jin, congratulations!

228
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,238
That's so lame.

229
00:18:46,538 --> 00:18:49,671
Do Jin, I'll miss you.

230
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,722
You're amazing as always.

231
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:55,571
That's too straightforward.

232
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:02,882
What is this?

233
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:06,029
Who left it here?

234
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:13,886
Who left...

235
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:18,770
Is it broken?

236
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,425
It looks so new.

237
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,635
Gosh, people these days...

238
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,318
They don't appreciate things anymore.

239
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,109
They're so ungrateful.

240
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:49,190
Where did she go?

241
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:52,842
What should I text him?

242
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:58,030
Excuse me!

243
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,561
Hold on!

244
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,200
Hey!

245
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:04,357
Hold on.

246
00:20:06,018 --> 00:20:06,903
Me?

247
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:07,973
Well...

248
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,059
Have you seen something this big...

249
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,084
What?

250
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,143
Never mind. I'm sorry.

251
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:30,329
What's with him?

252
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,452
Why couldn't he wait a bit longer?

253
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,565
I can get a job soon too.

254
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:44,132
-What are you doing?
-Gosh, you startled me.

255
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:47,660
You're trying too hard.

256
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:53,699
Who's that scruffy-looking girl?

257
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,497
She's my older brother.

258
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,861
Dad, I'm home.

259
00:21:02,124 --> 00:21:03,802
Gosh, I'm so tired.

260
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:08,043
I'm exhausted.

261
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:11,337
Dad.

262
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,609
-Who are you?
-Wait!

263
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,398
-What were you doing in there?
-Wait.

264
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,209
Who are you?

265
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:30,243
I can explain.

266
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,889
Explain what? What are you doing
in my house, you pervert?

267
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:36,254
-What are you doing...
-Calm down and hear me out.

268
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:37,543
You pervert!

269
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,610
What are you doing in my house, naked?

270
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,199
-No, please.
-Come here!

271
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:44,931
1,000,023...

272
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:47,486
Gosh, so many stairs.

273
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:50,016
O Sol.

274
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,163
-Mr. Gil!
-What's going on?

275
00:21:54,252 --> 00:21:55,529
-Come here!
-What's wrong?

276
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:58,410
Dad, who is this guy?

277
00:21:58,498 --> 00:21:59,698
I know what you're thinking.

278
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,799
Hold on!

279
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,748
-Dad!
-Mr. Gil!

280
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:06,272
My back.

281
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:10,212
My back. Please help me up.

282
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,042
Gosh, it's cold.

283
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:18,683
I told you to get a hot one.
This is too cold.

284
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:21,276
This was the only cheap one they had.

285
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:24,431
This is what you use when it's hot.
It's way too cold now.

286
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,237
Why didn't you tell me before?

287
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,620
If you moved into the rooftop
room, why did you shower here?

288
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:31,743
You even took off all your clothes.

289
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:34,699
Do you take a shower with your clothes on?

290
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:37,189
I mean...

291
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,301
Dad, are you okay?

292
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:44,699
Leave me alone.

293
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:48,810
O Sol, I think my back is broken.

294
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,537
Stop making a fuss.

295
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:54,016
If your back was broken,
you'd be dead by now.

296
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,075
You couldn't even lie down like that.

297
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,843
Gosh, why are you so reckless?

298
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,324
Didn't I tell you to be more careful?

299
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,466
Why are you trying to sit up?
Just lie down.

300
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:09,851
What's that?

301
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:11,803
Did you steal it?

302
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,319
What are you talking about?

303
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:16,688
I just picked it up on my way home.

304
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,330
Someone must have thrown it away.

305
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,271
It still looks okay.

306
00:23:20,653 --> 00:23:23,987
It must be pretty expensive.
Should we fix it and sell it?

307
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:32,665
-It's working.
-There you go. It's working.

308
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:34,909
It's working, right?

309
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,909
Judging from its state,

310
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,553
I think it belongs to someone.

311
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:43,510
Shouldn't we return it?

312
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:45,534
What are you talking about?

313
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:48,836
I found it in a pile of trash.

314
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,571
It seems to work fine.

315
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:56,136
It's right there! Pause it!

316
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:01,032
Can you zoom in?

317
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:02,698
Zoom in.

318
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:04,231
Zoom in.

319
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,705
Or is there a way...

320
00:24:06,794 --> 00:24:10,128
to make the image clearer?

321
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,014
Are you serious?

322
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,205
We're not crime scene investigators.

323
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:19,058
Just take a copy of this.

324
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,476
(Looking for a Cleaning Robot
1,000 dollars reward)

325
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:27,566
He has a ton of money. Why would
he want to find it so badly?

326
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,568
It doesn't even look that new.

327
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:34,922
You shouldn't have that
kind of attitude at work.

328
00:24:35,011 --> 00:24:37,548
This job might look trivial to you,

329
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:39,935
but for someone who has
worked in Chungmuro like me,

330
00:24:40,024 --> 00:24:41,591
image is everything.

331
00:24:42,237 --> 00:24:44,784
-He's so handsome.
-He looks so good.

332
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:46,505
Just a second.

333
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:50,389
Hi.

334
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:52,077
What's with him?

335
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,333
What was that?

336
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,764
Dong Hyeon, wait for me!

337
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,699
(1,000 dollars reward
Name: Geum Ja)

338
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,187
(We're sorry we're unable
to offer you the position)

339
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:28,664
You'll get in trouble
with the manager again.

340
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:31,816
I was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago.

341
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:33,500
Is he watching?

342
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,671
This unfair world doesn't
recognize my worth.

343
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,418
How many times has this happened already?

344
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,524
Stop making a fuss. This isn't even
the first time you've failed to get a job.

345
00:25:45,613 --> 00:25:47,998
That's the problem.
This isn't the first time.

346
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:52,510
I really want to know what it feels
like to pass the first screening.

347
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:54,989
What is it that I lack?
What's the problem?

348
00:25:55,634 --> 00:25:57,079
Cut it out.

349
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:01,498
To pass the screening,
you have to be sexy, okay?

350
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,905
-Sexy?
-Be it your cover letter or resume,

351
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:05,306
something has to be sexy.

352
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:07,936
You're just boring all the way.

353
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:09,798
Hey, wake up.

354
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:13,364
Seriously. You're my only friend.
Do you have to say that?

355
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:14,773
Sorry.

356
00:26:16,932 --> 00:26:18,977
I have to pay the tuition soon too.

357
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,908
Ju Yeon, don't you need a vacuum cleaner?

358
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,299
The latest-model robot vacuum.

359
00:26:26,388 --> 00:26:27,622
I have one that works perfectly fine.

360
00:26:28,197 --> 00:26:29,197
You picked it up, didn't you?

361
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:31,557
What do you take me for?

362
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,492
How about 100 bucks?

363
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:36,300
-90 bucks.
-Gosh, come on.

364
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,238
Hello?

365
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,045
Hey, Dad.

366
00:26:41,423 --> 00:26:42,267
What?

367
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,502
The hospital?

368
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:47,142
I've told Mr. Park, so get going.

369
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,165
He'll tell you what to do.

370
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,386
Still, Dad...

371
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:54,034
What? You're my daughter.

372
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:56,516
Are you embarrassed of what I do?
Is that it?

373
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,817
That's not it, just listen to me.

374
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,531
You know well that I'm
looking for a job right now.

375
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,083
I just got off work. If I go home now,

376
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:07,793
I have to study English, submit
applications, and write my resume.

377
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,664
I have a ton of stuff to do.

378
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,939
Whatever. This is your fault,
so you should be responsible.

379
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,402
Why is this my fault?

380
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,133
If you didn't make that fuss yesterday,

381
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:18,270
I wouldn't be here in the first place.

382
00:27:21,086 --> 00:27:23,054
You're unbelievable.

383
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:26,529
That was because of that
guy in the rooftop house.

384
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,742
No matter how desperate you are for money,

385
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:30,616
can you please screen
out the weird tenants?

386
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,216
Do you really want to accept weirdos
like that when you have a daughter?

387
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:36,121
Seriously.

388
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,757
Honey, I'll be back.

389
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:46,602
You better not disappear from now on.

390
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,945
I can't live without you!

391
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:51,002
Don't cry.

392
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,240
And don't forget to take your medicine.

393
00:27:54,823 --> 00:27:55,956
I'll see you next week.

394
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:57,955
Let's go now.

395
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:04,269
You're here.

396
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:06,332
How is your dad? Is he okay?

397
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,238
He needs to wait for a full day
and check if his back is okay.

398
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:12,943
He always worked too hard.

399
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:27,203
There's a reason you're
unemployed at that age.

400
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:28,607
I'm not unemployed.

401
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:30,844
Do you just like to idle about then?

402
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:34,512
You can date all you want, but don't
cause a fuss in this house, okay?

403
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,700
10, 100, 1,000... 1,000 dollars?

404
00:28:49,373 --> 00:28:50,673
Yes!

405
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,694
I see. So you're saying,

406
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:10,015
there is no robot vacuum among
the new items that you found, right?

407
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,657
Okay, thank you.

408
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:30,642
Are you looking for Geum Ja?

409
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:31,636
Who is this?

410
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:35,102
Come to the karaoke room behind
Dongmyeong District Office now.

411
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,651
And don't forget the reward!

412
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,576
Hello?

413
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:47,919
-You're so annoying.
-Let go of me.

414
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:50,188
I told you I can make it.

415
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:54,960
What was that?

416
00:30:00,054 --> 00:30:01,187
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,442
Wait a minute, Mister.

418
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:06,655
Yes?

419
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,375
Do you think this is a gym?

420
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,337
Does this look like a basketball hoop?

421
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:16,206
If you want to apologize, do it properly.

422
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:18,642
Do you think of me as
some sort of trashcan?

423
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:20,500
Do you want to die?

424
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:23,426
Is that Do Jin?

425
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,480
-What are you doing here?
-I didn't hit you on purpose.

426
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:30,135
Hey, are you okay?

427
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,538
-Just go.
-I'm sorry.

428
00:30:32,627 --> 00:30:34,272
-He's a bit drunk.
-Please, just go.

429
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,300
Okay.

430
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,261
I'd like to apologize instead.

431
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,339
-I'm sorry.
-Please, just leave.

432
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,340
Let's go.

433
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,381
Is he gone?

434
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,510
Excuse me, take this...

435
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,238
Are you...

436
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,095
...O Sol?

437
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:55,921
Gosh, please...

438
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:58,104
You're O Sol, right?

439
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:03,390
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

440
00:31:07,587 --> 00:31:09,968
Excuse me. Hold on a minute!

441
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:11,411
You left this behind.

442
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:16,296
-Move!
-Look at that!

443
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,323
Hold on!

444
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:25,751
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

445
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,520
Please stop for a second.

446
00:31:28,956 --> 00:31:30,288
Hold on!

447
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,591
What's going on?

448
00:31:37,956 --> 00:31:39,994
Hey, what are you going to
do with the reward money?

449
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:43,569
-Don't keep it for yourself.
-Don't worry and just follow me.

450
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:46,124
I'll buy something nice
once I receive this money.

451
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:49,908
-Hey, what is that?
-It's a horse. Look!

452
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,991
-What on earth is that?
-It's a horse.

453
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,524
Move, move!

454
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,183
This is awesome.

455

-Let's follow them. Come on.
-Okay.

456
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:01,691
Hurry up!

457
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,054
Miss, hold on.

458
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,723
Please, stop!

459
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:16,261
Watch out.

460
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:17,809
What is this?

461
00:32:17,898 --> 00:32:20,292
Miss! Please stop for a second.

Hi there, Horse!

What is that thing?

00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:42,691
-What is all that?
-It's trash.

Hey.

How could you run away
after ruining my car like that?

00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,267
You're sorry?

491
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:17,062
Stop joking around
in that silly little mask.

492
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:18,411
Aren't you going to take it off?

493
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:21,720
I can't take this anymore.

494
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:29,427
You're a woman.

495
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:33,486
Gil O Sol.

496
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:43,238
Why are you looking at me like that?

497
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,533
It wasn't my fault.
You were the one who...

498
00:35:45,622 --> 00:35:46,722
I'm sorry.

499
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:51,219
You can call me.

500
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:57,971
-Wait.
-Excuse me, I'm sorry.

501
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:00,636
O Sol, wait.

502
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:06,064
What's going on?
Do they know each other?

503
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,303
Who knew it'd be a girl?

504
00:36:29,783 --> 00:36:31,484
What do you think you're doing?
Quit taking photos.

505
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:35,509
What's so funny?

506
00:36:36,203 --> 00:36:37,904
You'd better delete all
the photos you took!

507
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,519
This is crazy.

508
00:37:37,303 --> 00:37:38,994
(O Sol's Room)

509
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:23,096
I told them to disinfect the car
after doing the necessary repairs.

510
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,121
It'll probably take about a week.

511
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,671
I'd like a brand-new car.

512
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:32,081
Disinfecting the car
won't completely get rid of the bacteria.

513
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,203
Got it, sir.

514
00:38:33,406 --> 00:38:36,240
Also, I'm bringing this up just in case.

515
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:39,284
If it's necessary, I'll look into
finding a new housekeeper for you.

516
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:42,661
It's all right.

517
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,428
It's not necessary for now.

518
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:50,736
I've always been curious.

519
00:38:51,711 --> 00:38:54,045
Why are you so obsessed
with your vacuum cleaner?

520
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,178
If you'd like a new one, I can
easily find a better one for you.

521
00:38:57,267 --> 00:38:58,467
I guess you don't know.

522
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:00,852
It may look nothing special,

523
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,306
but an Italian expert built
its vacuum tube by hand.

524
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,743
It's limited-edition.

525
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,204
You know what "limited-edition" is, right?

526
00:39:12,336 --> 00:39:13,403
I'll be off, then.

527
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:22,470
Ms. Kim Geum Ja?

528
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,301
Here you go.

529
00:39:26,971 --> 00:39:29,615
-It is for you, right?
-Yes, thank you.

530
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,540
No problem.

531
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:35,267
You're hospitalized.
What do you need that for?

532
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,257
I told you to just tell me
if you ever need anything.

533
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:41,703
I got this for you, not me.

534
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:43,694
It's for me?

535
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,594
What? Are you already thinking of
washing your hands off your duty?

536
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:52,716
I heard this is very popular these days.

537
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:56,305
I thought it'd be useful
for  you when I'm not around.

538
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:05,319
I can't use things like that
because I don't trust it.

539
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,703
So get better soon...

540
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:10,452
...so that you can come back home.

541
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,098
Geum Ja, without you,

542
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,178
my place just doesn't feel clean.

543
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:45,963
I'm sorry I missed your call.

544
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,627
Something urgent has come up.

545
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:49,580
I'll call you back another time.

546
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:19,310
What... That...

547
00:41:19,399 --> 00:41:20,673
That horse head?

548
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:30,668
A horse head? My gosh, O Sol.
It's so funny that my stomach hurts.

549
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:31,824
That horse head...

550
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,104
Gosh, this... That horse
head is killing me.

551
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:43,837
Hey, turn it off, will you?

552
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,771
Gosh, I told you to turn it off.

553
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,504
O Sol, you kill me. That was hilarious.
My tummy hurts.

554
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:53,271
Hey, I think you'll get a job.

555
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:54,599
As a comedienne.

556
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,800
What if you get cast right away?

557
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,720
That clip has already
gotten over 100,000 views.

558
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,120
100,000 or a million views,

559
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:02,622
I do not care at all.

560
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:05,901
Is that so? Then why do you look so upset?

561
00:42:08,341 --> 00:42:11,857
Why Do Jin of all people?

562
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:15,065
Why did Do Jin have to be
there right at that moment?

563
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:21,358
Hey, what can you do now?
It already happened.

564
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:23,782
You should forget about him...

565
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,070
...and focus on getting a job, O Sol.

566
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:29,503
We live in a big world,
and there are many other guys.

567
00:42:30,003 --> 00:42:32,309
For me, it has to be Do Jin.
I'm going to say no...

568
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:34,115
...even if you bring me
a truckload of other guys.

569
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:35,737
How devoted.

570
00:42:35,904 --> 00:42:37,937
What do you even like
so much about that guy?

571
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:40,858
Objectively speaking,
he isn't a good catch.

572
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,203
Right, he isn't.

573
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,858
That's why I like him.
I like that he's an ordinary guy.

574
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,800
-What do you mean?
-He's just an average guy,

575
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,637
and that's what I like about him.

576
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:03,244
Here's to our freshmen's bright future!

577
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,770
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

578
00:43:05,804 --> 00:43:07,138
Oh, Do Jin is here.

579
00:43:08,804 --> 00:43:10,171
-Hello.
-Hello.

580
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,037
(2014 Freshmen Welcoming Party)

581
00:43:42,362 --> 00:43:44,374
It began from the right to be let alone,

582
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:46,897
which was part of the
treatise published in 1888.

583
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,667
The right to privacy was mentioned
before the 20th century even dawned,

584
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:53,798
and the notion has been shaped
to what it is now,

585
00:43:53,887 --> 00:43:56,421
since the onset of the Information Age
back in the 20th century.

586
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,848
In order to protect...

587
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:01,772
...our privacy more effectively...

588
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,386
...we've come up with a tool to analyze...

589
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,942
...how personal information is managed
in interpersonal relationships...

590
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,580
Focus on the lecture, kiddo.

591
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,719
He's kind and considerate.

592
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:17,722
He cares, but he never makes it obvious.

593
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:19,624
That's why I fell for him.

594
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:23,530
A guy like him cared about me,
and it made me happy.

595
00:44:24,303 --> 00:44:26,870
What a joke. Goodness gracious.

596
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:30,100
Hey, we're having a serious
conversation here.

597
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:31,282
Must you talk like that?

598
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:33,685
It sounds like he's the type of
guy that's nice to every girl.

599
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:37,156
Don't you think he's probably
keeping a ton of girls on the hook?

600
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:38,315
Even you got the wrong idea.

601
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:40,237
-I did not.
-Then why aren't you two dating?

602
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:41,816
It's been 3 years, 3 long years.

603
00:44:41,904 --> 00:44:45,271
Even from what I know, he's dated
a few girls in the past three years.

604
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,635
It's just because Do Jin and I...

605
00:44:49,243 --> 00:44:51,817
I mean, it's just that
the timing wasn't right.

606
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:53,483
You know what I mean. We flirt.

607
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:55,182
There's definitely something between us.

608
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,771
Sure, you'll grow old if you
keep waiting for the right time.

609
00:45:00,427 --> 00:45:03,395
Goodness. By the way, what
happened with that thing?

610
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:05,734
-What thing?
-That accident. Did you meet him?

611
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,845
(Jang Seon Gyeol)

612
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:27,325
Those pants with bagged-out knees.
She's probably had it on for a week.

613
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,707
And look at that day-old kimchi stain.

614
00:45:31,038 --> 00:45:32,964
Cheap pork cutlets for lunch.

615
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,466
Hair unwashed for at least three days.

616
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:52,064
What are you doing?

617
00:45:52,856 --> 00:45:53,848
It's a sanitizer.

618
00:45:53,937 --> 00:45:56,039
Don't worry. It's made
with natural ingredients.

619
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:57,804
It's harmless to humans.

620
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,282
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

621
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,230
I never even got to apologize properly.

622
00:46:06,437 --> 00:46:08,998
I'm usually very sensible and polite.

623
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:10,901
Yesterday, I had reasons...

624
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,104
What could this be?

625
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,403
Let me see.

626
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,979
3,500...

627
00:46:25,772 --> 00:46:27,073
3,500 dollars?

628
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:29,094
Do you want to wire it?

629
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:30,911
Or would cash be better?

630
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,611
I mean... It was just some trash.

631
00:46:37,737 --> 00:46:39,096
(Car Inspection and Repair Report)

632
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:42,612
It doesn't include the compensation
for my psychological injury.

633
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,913
That trash...

634
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:48,665
Do you know how much I suffered
because of all that trash?

635
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:51,704
Gosh.

636
00:46:52,856 --> 00:46:57,907
Well... Could I get a
discount or something?

637
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,542
As you can see, I'm trying to find...

638
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:03,407
I'm still a student.

639
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,057
I thought you were a street cleaner.

640
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,282
It's a long story.

641
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,282
If you could wait until I get a job...

642
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,171
Hold on. Didn't you just
say you were a student?

643
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:19,711
Students have to get a job
at some point, don't they?

644
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,771
What's with that face?

645
00:47:24,427 --> 00:47:25,277
Nothing.

646
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:30,102
Next month...

647
00:47:31,537 --> 00:47:33,515
I mean, can't you wait...

648
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:35,736
...until the end of this month?

649
00:47:36,503 --> 00:47:38,337
Please.

650
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:41,904
You've seen...

651
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:44,770
...something like this, right?

652
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:48,816
(Missing Robot Vacuum)

653
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:50,004
Geum Ja?

654
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,703
This is...

655
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,004
-It was you that threw it away?
-Threw it?

656
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:58,147
Why would I throw away something
that works perfectly fine?

657
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:00,682
But it was in a pile of trash.

658
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,237
In any case, if you're keeping
it, please return it...

659
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:07,393
...instead of demanding money
through someone else.

660
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,682
Demanding money?
What are you talking about?

661
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,371
It's you that made this
person contact me, isn't it?

662
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:22,470
And that's what caused the accident.

663
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:27,915
That's my brother's number.

664
00:48:28,003 --> 00:48:30,270
(Something came up.
I'll get in touch with you soon.)

665
00:48:31,437 --> 00:48:33,071
Gosh.

666
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,404
I'm sorry. There has been
some misunderstanding.

667
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:40,270
I'll return it to you right away.

668
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,106
In return, can I get a discount?

669
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,358
Just as much as the reward.

670
00:48:47,642 --> 00:48:48,909
Can I?

671
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:04,308
-Help!
-Hey! Do you have a death wish?

672
00:49:04,397 --> 00:49:06,403
What were you going to do
with that 1,000 dollars?

673
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:07,649
What were you going to do?

674
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,082
Hold on. Let go of me first.

675
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,904
I might die.

676
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:14,260
Why didn't you tell me
you saw that poster?

677
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,919
-You brat.
-Help!

678
00:49:17,277 --> 00:49:19,145
-Be quiet.
-Help...

679
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:21,478
-Please.
-Hold on.

680
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,194
-Help...
-Hi, Ju Yeon.

681
00:49:26,308 --> 00:49:27,175
What?

682
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,088
A party for Do Jin?

683
00:49:30,227 --> 00:49:32,239
Are you crazy?

684
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,301
How could I show up there?

685
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:35,845
I can't. I'm not going.

686
00:49:35,933 --> 00:49:38,401
Ju Yeon! Help me! I'm dying.

687
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,991
I just can't. Just go by yourself.

688
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,712
It'd be too humiliating.

689
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,967
I said I'm not going.

690
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,000
Gosh.

691
00:49:51,433 --> 00:49:52,597
Oh, my.

692
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:54,489
You look pretty today.

693
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:57,267
You said you weren't coming.

694
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,300
What's with you? You look so pretty.

695
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,967
I can't believe it.
Hey, show me your teeth.

696
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,233
Hey. I think this is a bad idea.

697
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,900
-I shouldn't go in.
-Come on.

698
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:09,317
O Sol.

699
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:12,111
-O Sol. You're here.
-Come here.

700
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:14,167
-Come here.
-Why are you late?

701
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:16,733
-Come have a seat.
-We're sorry we're late.

702
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,267
-Have a seat.
-It's been so long.

703
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:20,700
It's been a while.

704
00:50:22,867 --> 00:50:24,989
This seat is not taken.

705
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,468
-Welcome.
-You ordered something already?

706
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,050
Guys, did you see that horse mask video?

707
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,251
-Of course.
-It's hilarious.

708
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,274
You mean the one with the cart, right?

709
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,234
You've all seen that?

710
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,368
-Of course.
-It's so funny.

711
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,743
-It's hilarious.
-Guys!

712
00:50:47,134 --> 00:50:48,645
Cut it out and drink.

713
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:50,467
We're here to drink, right?

714
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,568
Fill your glasses.

715
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:54,467
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

716
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:56,833
-Cheers!
-Congratulations!

717
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:00,134
It tastes good.

718
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:02,860
Let me fill your glass.

719
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:04,255
Okay.

720
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,833
Eat a lot.

721
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,620
It's been such a long time.

722
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,500
What was that?

723
00:51:17,034 --> 00:51:18,268
What did you just do?

724
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:20,078
-What happened?
-What's going on between you two?

725
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,145
-What's going on?
-That's called flirting.

726
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:22,845
What's going on?

727
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:25,700
-What is it?
-What's going on?

728
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,012
-Is there something going on?
-Tell us.

729
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,500
-Tell us.
-Just drink.

730
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:33,835
-Let's just drink.
-Drink.

731
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:35,633
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

732
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,355
What are you doing here alone?

733
00:51:53,737 --> 00:51:54,789
Do Jin.

734
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,900
I just wanted some fresh air.

735
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:02,609
I was so surprised that day.

736
00:52:04,544 --> 00:52:05,711
Ju Yeon told me...

737
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,100
...you were filling in for your dad
because he wasn't feeling well.

738
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:10,033
Well...

739
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:14,294
Other girls wouldn't
have wanted to do that.

740
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,534
It's so nice of you, O Sol.

741
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,638
Come back in.

742
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,389
Let's have another drink.

743
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,534
I was waiting for you.

744
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,273
He was waiting for me?

745
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,979
Hey, what's wrong? Are you sick?

746
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:03,167
-I can't breathe. My heart...
-Heart?

747
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,245
I can't breathe.

748
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:08,400
Gosh. Did you drink too much again?

749
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:10,301
Let me call an ambulance.

750
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:12,000
It's nice of me?

751
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:14,934
He said it's nice of me.

752
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,097
Ju Yeon, what should I do?

753
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,445
I like Do Jin so much.

754
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,267
What should I do?

755
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:31,033
There you go again.

756
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,566
This is a serious problem.

757
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:38,566
I have butterflies in my stomach.

758
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,668
(Do Jin, the courage to be honest)

759
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,378
Do Jin, thank you...

760
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:20,000
...for not telling the others.

761
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:24,995
Also, congratulations on your new job.

762
00:54:32,108 --> 00:54:33,611
Do you want to come to my work tomorrow?

763
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,800
Let me buy you lunch.

764
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:47,833
Come.

765
00:54:48,904 --> 00:54:51,505
-Welcome.
-Hi.

766
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,334
Hey, stop it.

767
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,879
So his messenger status says,

768
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,784
"The courage to be honest",

769
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,440
and the background music is "Confession"?

770
00:55:05,026 --> 00:55:06,329
That says it all.

771
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,879
What do you think?
Wouldn't this be a provocative gift?

772
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:12,967
This would make you two get
a hotel room right away.

773
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,433
You're crazy.

774
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:20,395
It's not even a special day.
Giving him underwear as a present...

775
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,118
...would be too much.

776
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:25,307
Hey. He wants to have lunch with you.

777
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:27,429
Near his new workplace.

778
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:29,211
What do you think that means?

779
00:55:29,512 --> 00:55:32,478
"I'm prepared for you now. Let's go out."

780
00:55:32,566 --> 00:55:34,355
That's what it means, you idiot.

781
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:35,456
Really?

782
00:55:36,175 --> 00:55:38,488
Are you going to hesitate again
and miss the right timing?

783
00:55:38,577 --> 00:55:40,977
No, of course not. That must not happen.

784
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:43,424
Focus, and do as I say.

785
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:46,381
Hold this underwear in front of him,
and say in a shy voice,

786
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:49,284
"Do Jin, am I your girlfriend now?"

787
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,410
Oh my gosh!

788
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:58,267
Hey, are men's underwear
really this expensive?

789
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,001
This is a month's worth of food costs.

790
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,534
Hey. You should be able to afford
it since you're working now.

791
00:56:07,678 --> 00:56:09,379
It's 3,500 dollars.

792
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:10,807
3,500 dollars.

793
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,024
3,500 dollars.

794
00:56:14,113 --> 00:56:16,480
Hey, Miss Gil O Sol.

795
00:56:17,133 --> 00:56:19,543
It will cost you 3,500 dollars.

796
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:23,479
You have to pay back 3,500 dollars
for the repair cost.

797
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:25,068
3,500 dollars.

798
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,401
It costs 3,500 dollars to repair my car.

799
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:30,233
Three thousand...

800
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:33,567
...five hundred...

801
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:36,368
...dollars!

802
00:56:48,934 --> 00:56:50,934
Hey, does this one look okay?

803
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,078
-Are you going to buy it?
-Yes.

804
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:54,900
Hurry up. Miss, we'll take this one.

805
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:57,667
Okay.

806
00:57:14,127 --> 00:57:15,260
Is something wrong?

807
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:23,534
O Sol.

808
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,667
I'm sorry I'm late.

809
00:57:28,033 --> 00:57:30,500
That's okay, I just arrived.

810
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:32,368
Are you busy with work?

811
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,667
Our models suddenly didn't show up today.

812
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,266
They didn't show up?

813
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,846
I'm sorry to hear that.
Did you take care of it?

814
00:57:40,934 --> 00:57:42,924
My boss is all over me right now.

815
00:57:43,196 --> 00:57:45,279
I can't believe this happened as
soon as I joined this company.

816
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:47,547
I'm sorry for calling
you all the way here.

817
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,377
Don't worry about it.

818
00:57:50,466 --> 00:57:53,566
If you're busy, I can
just come back next time.

819
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:58,372
O Sol, I'm sorry, but
can you do me a favor?

820
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,734
A favor?

821
00:58:01,586 --> 00:58:04,781
A student? Student my foot.

822
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,934
How dare you lie to me?

823
00:58:08,092 --> 00:58:09,372
You sneaky little woman.

824
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,118
This goes perfect with drinks and
is also nutritious for children.

825
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:16,611
Also, I'd like to recommend this
as a tasty side dish as well.

826
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,045
A ton of benefits are
waiting if you call now.

827
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:23,299
Doesn't that woman eat so deliciously?

828
00:58:23,387 --> 00:58:24,230
That's amazing.

829
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,378
Do you want to order?

830
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:27,978
-What is that woman?
-She's eating so deliciously...

831
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:29,846
...and our phones are ringing
like crazy right now.

832
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:31,535
My goodness.

833
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,701
"Am I your girlfriend?" my foot.

834
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,271
(3 missed calls from 3,500 Dollars)

835
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:08,345
What do I do?

836
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,967
Whatever, forget it.

837
00:59:15,133 --> 00:59:16,048
I don't care.

838
00:59:31,977 --> 00:59:34,101
It was tough today, wasn't it? I'm sorry.

839
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:35,542
You're my savior.

840
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:41,221
I'm glad I was able to help, Do Jin.

841
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,978
Thanks, O Sol. You're the
only one I can count on.

842
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:47,066
Good night.

843
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,834
Seriously...

844
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,134
I'm the only one he can count on?

845
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:00,800
Good night, Do Jin.

846
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:09,733
I'm sorry.

847
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,733
Something urgent came up yesterday.

848
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:17,268
I'm really sorry. Yes.

849
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:20,801
Oh, okay.

850
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,546
After the big sellout on our
last home shopping broadcast,

851
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:25,268
other channels are
contacting us continuously.

852
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,234
I'll compare each channel...

853
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,701
I'm busy in the morning.

854
01:00:29,901 --> 01:00:30,879
Let's meet in the afternoon.

855
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:33,334
Okay. By any chance...

856
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:36,100
...can you give me a discount...

857
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:37,864
Hello?

858
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,120
Hello?

859
01:00:40,377 --> 01:00:41,577
That jerk.

860
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,001
How could he hang up
when I'm still talking?

861
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,390
Get out of the way.

862
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,533
What the...

863
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,947
Is it broken?

864
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,500
Goodness.

865
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,934
Yes, Do Jin.

866
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:16,901
What?

867
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,867
Right now?

868
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,067
No, of course, I have time.

869
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:29,800
Sure, I'll be right there.

870
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,567
Okay, Do Jin. See you later.

871
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:42,534
What should I wear? Oh, right.

872
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:55,467
What should I wear? My hair!

873
01:01:55,667 --> 01:01:56,934
(JB Home Shopping)

874
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,900
Miss Gil O Sol?

875
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:05,101
Yes? Can I help you?

876
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,221
Did you wait too long?

877
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,190
It's almost time to begin.
Let's go upstairs.

878
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,413
Hold on.

879
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:10,760
Begin what?

880
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,601
I came here to meet Lee Do Jin,
who works here.

881
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,795
I know, so we should hurry. Come on.

882
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:18,744
Hold on.

883
01:02:19,554 --> 01:02:20,403
What is this about?

884
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:22,541
You know the drill since you
did it last time, right?

885
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,301
It's not much different from food.

886
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:27,149
The dressing room is on the right,
so you can change into this.

887
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,813
I think you're mistaken about something.

888
01:02:29,901 --> 01:02:31,978
I came because I have plans
today at this place.

889
01:02:32,066 --> 01:02:33,800
-I know, so hurry.
-Sorry?

890
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,900
There he comes. Do Jin.

891
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,767
Do Jin.

892
01:02:41,373 --> 01:02:42,640
I think she's...

893
01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:44,545
...mistaken about something.
Can you explain it to her?

894
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:46,576
O Sol, I'll explain later.

895
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:47,813
Go get changed first.

896
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:48,766
What?

897
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:50,280
I'll see you after the show.

898
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,945
I think we should maintain
our concept from last time...

899
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:59,612
...and add free gifts such
as natural detergents...

900
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,501
...or magic cleaning sponges.

901
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:05,415
I'll discuss it with our PR Team
and get back to you.

902
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:07,082
I really can't do this.

903
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:08,450
I don't think this is a good idea.

904
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:11,573
How could you back out
like this right now?

905
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Horse head?

906
01:03:21,033 --> 01:03:23,512
But I never heard anything about
this in the first place...

907
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,800
...and you just dragged me in here.

908
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,400
You're unbelievable.

909
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:29,621
Didn't you already agree
with Do Jin about this?

910
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:32,604
-But I didn't...
-Do Jin told me,

911
01:03:32,744 --> 01:03:34,340
that he called a friend
who is good at her work,

912
01:03:34,433 --> 01:03:36,179
and you'd help out with
anything since you're kind.

913
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:37,389
Am I wrong?

914
01:03:38,837 --> 01:03:40,004
Do Jin, where are you?

915
01:03:41,267 --> 01:03:42,501
Come over here and take care of this.

916
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:48,491
O Sol, what are you doing?

917
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
You're already dressed.

918
01:03:51,267 --> 01:03:53,068
We're starting soon.
Go stand in your position.

919
01:03:53,206 --> 01:03:54,118
Do Jin.

920
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:56,266
-What is this, Do Jin?
-I'm sorry, Honey.

921
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:59,169
I'll persuade her, so don't
worry and get back to work.

922
01:04:00,697 --> 01:04:02,964
I even promised to pay more
since she's a star on YouTube.

923
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,345
Do Jin...

924
01:04:09,524 --> 01:04:12,412
O Sol, what happened was...

925
01:04:12,943 --> 01:04:15,143
Get ready. One minute before we go on air.

926
01:04:19,385 --> 01:04:21,498
Let's finish the show first and...

927
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:23,054
Is this what you called me for?

928
01:04:25,413 --> 01:04:28,747
You wanted to use me as a model
since I was a star on YouTube?

929
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,163
Is that why you said you
want to treat me...

930
01:04:31,252 --> 01:04:33,326
...and made me come here and work?

931
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:34,515
Don't get me wrong, O Sol.

932
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:37,015
I heard about your situation
and felt bad for you.

933
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:38,511
It's a good money-making gig,

934
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,967
so I thought it'd be win-win for us both.

935
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:41,260
That's why I did it.

936
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,833
Let's be honest.
This is better than the cleaning job.

937
01:04:45,104 --> 01:04:46,849
It's easier, and even the pay is...

938
01:04:46,938 --> 01:04:47,784
Jerk.

939
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,600
What did you just say?

940
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,867
You knew, didn't you?

941
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:56,903
The fact that I've had a crush
on you for a long time.

942
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,714
Since the freshmen week to now,

943
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,509
I liked you. I really did.

944
01:05:07,811 --> 01:05:10,844
You kept confusing me.

945
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:13,854
I couldn't give up because
you kept giving me hope.

946
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,768
And in the end, you made me
feel like a total idiot.

947
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,301
One minute to the live broadcast.
I'll begin counting down.

948
01:05:26,534 --> 01:05:27,701
Thank you.

949
01:05:32,943 --> 01:05:34,043
At least now...

950
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,633
Now, I've come to my senses,
so I thank you for that.

951
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,867
I feel so stupid that I wasted
three years liking such a jerk,

952
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,501
but I'm also very glad
that I can end it here.

953
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,993
O Sol.

954
01:05:49,933 --> 01:05:50,799
Gil O Sol.

955
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,624
I didn't think I'd run into you here...

956
01:06:54,834 --> 01:06:55,812
Excuse me.

957
01:06:58,634 --> 01:07:00,834
Here. It's the thing
you've been looking for.

958
01:07:08,146 --> 01:07:09,051
This is...

959
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,201
I'll be in touch as soon as I save
enough money for the repair cost.

960
01:07:24,029 --> 01:07:26,997
I guess we no longer need to
revise your afternoon schedule.

961
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:29,849
Right.

962
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:33,488
Please get in.

963
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:39,549
-This is our fall promotion.
-Yes.

964
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:42,439
As you can see, these handsome
guys from Cleaning Fairies...

965
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:44,646
...will visit your place and
clean it inside out.

966
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:47,045
Men rarely do housework
or help with cleaning,

967
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:48,078
and it upsets many ladies.

968
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:49,945
Don't be upset, and put
your worries to rest.

969
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,878
These handsome Cleaning Fairies...

970
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:55,221
...will visit you and make
sure that your place...

971
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,873
...is always sparkling clean.

972
01:08:01,865 --> 01:08:02,817
Yes, Honey.

973
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:05,250
What do you want to eat?

974
01:08:05,339 --> 01:08:06,673
I'll make a reservation at a restaurant.

975
01:08:07,142 --> 01:08:09,342
Wait just a little longer, my baby.

976
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:11,332
I'll pick you up as soon
as I can leave work.

977
01:08:12,403 --> 01:08:14,637
Gosh, my manager is calling again.

978
01:08:14,777 --> 01:08:16,444
Yes, I love you too.

979
01:08:17,667 --> 01:08:19,412
I'll call you later. I love you too.

980
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,867
Are you looking for something, sir?

981
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:24,435
Did I forget to bring the disinfectant?

982
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:25,730
I have it, sir.

983
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:32,954
Hey, Yeon Jeong.

984
01:08:33,461 --> 01:08:35,295
Gosh, I'm a little busy today.

985
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:36,644
Can we meet tomorrow?

986
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,717
Come on, we haven't seen
each other in a while,

987
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,217
but you have no reason to be suspicious.

988
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:42,686
All right?

989
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:46,382
Yes. I love you. Kisses.

990
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,901
Look, what are you doing now?

991
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:56,082
I'm sorry, but there are some
disgusting bacteria in here.

992
01:08:56,714 --> 01:08:57,847
Let me finish up.

993
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:00,900
Gosh, is this man crazy or what?

994
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:04,501
Look, have you lost your mind?

995
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:10,009
Ms. Kwon, I need another one.

996
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,471
Why did you do that, sir?

997
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,461
You're usually careful in
front of other people.

998
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,833
Was there another human being in there?

999
01:09:43,001 --> 01:09:44,068
I didn't know.

1000
01:09:58,967 --> 01:10:01,179
How dare he lead you on
when he has a girlfriend?

1001
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:03,379
Hey, no one knew.

1002
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,746
He totally looks like a good guy,

1003
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,501
but I knew it because
he was nice to every girl.

1004
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,834
Hey, he's a total piece of trash.

1005
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,453
Ju Yeon.

1006
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,867
Do you know this?

1007
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,034
What having a crush on someone
and underwear have in common.

1008
01:10:19,433 --> 01:10:22,294
What having a crush on someone
and underwear have in common?

1009
01:10:22,383 --> 01:10:25,468
Both of them become...

1010
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:27,791
...so nasty at the end.

1011
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:29,901
Like what happened to me.

1012
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,067
Do you find that funny?

1013
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:37,976
It's hilarious.

1014
01:10:40,938 --> 01:10:42,071
Ju Yeon.

1015
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:44,538
You see,

1016
01:10:45,513 --> 01:10:48,414
I've finally realized why I'm
struggling so much to get a job.

1017
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,890
What are you talking about now?

1018
01:10:51,934 --> 01:10:54,794
Well, I am...

1019
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,519
...such a poor judge of character.

1020
01:10:56,608 --> 01:10:58,821
I'm so slow-witted.

1021
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:01,300
I wouldn't be good at anything.

1022
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,212
All those human resources people
I've dealt with have a good eye.

1023
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,479
Hey, why are you blaming yourself?

1024
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:10,468
He confused you and led you on,
so it is completely his fault.

1025
01:11:14,367 --> 01:11:17,400
Hey, you probably know this.

1026
01:11:19,788 --> 01:11:20,921
Racehorses.

1027
01:11:21,834 --> 01:11:23,001
They wear...

1028
01:11:24,969 --> 01:11:26,612
...blinders right here...

1029
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,401
...so that they're not
distracted during the race.

1030
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:32,107
That way, they can look ahead
and keep running, you know.

1031
01:11:34,087 --> 01:11:38,394
Without a reason or a goal...

1032
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,701
...they start running
because they're startled...

1033
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,823
...by the sound from the starting pistol.

1034
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,934
And they keep running
because they are running.

1035
01:11:50,967 --> 01:11:54,568
They don't think and just keep
on running at the same pace.

1036
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:57,622
What on earth are you talking about now?

1037
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:00,734
Are you already drunk? Just after this?

1038
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:08,934
I think that's what I've
been like this whole time...

1039
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,301
...I had a crush on Do Jin.

1040
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:18,134
At the beginning of it all,
I just fell for him.

1041
01:12:20,426 --> 01:12:24,294
I kept going because I liked the way
my feelings for him made me feel.

1042
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:27,895
Without thinking...

1043
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:30,867
....and even without any reasons...

1044
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,834
-...I just liked him.
-Hey.

1045
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,446
By the way, why aren't you
giving me the robot vacuum?

1046
01:12:39,534 --> 01:12:40,456
What?

1047
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,212
I sent you the money.

1048
01:12:42,301 --> 01:12:44,735
The famous French writer,
Stendhal, said...

1049
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:47,768
...that when someone is in love,
what the person loves...

1050
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:49,968
...is not the other person...

1051
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:53,384
...but the fascination with him
or herself being in love.

1052
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:54,573
It's nothing more than that.

1053
01:12:56,948 --> 01:13:00,943
Looking back, the past three
years of my life was just that.

1054
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,533
The sheer fantasies that
I had about Do Jin...

1055
01:13:05,828 --> 01:13:08,362
...made me smile, laugh, and shed tears.

1056
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,567
Why didn't I know then how
foolish all of that is?

1057
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,034
And now that I've woken up
from the foolish fantasies,

1058
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,467
I'm left with nothing...

1059
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:24,573
...but money just enough to sustain me
for a month and men's underwear.

1060
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:41,967
Gosh...

1061
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:48,000
I must've been crazy.

1062
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:51,017
Dad's been wearing underwear with holes...

1063
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:53,373
...for the past 10 years,
and I didn't care.

1064
01:13:56,148 --> 01:13:59,201
Gosh, I can't believe
I bought that expensive thing.

1065
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:01,268
I'm so crazy.

1066
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:11,333
The bag with that robot vacuum!

1067
01:14:26,934 --> 01:14:28,067
(You and me)

1068
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,800
I wanted to ask you out from
the moment I first saw you.

1069
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:36,973
Are we together now?

1070
01:14:39,457 --> 01:14:40,490
My goodness.

1071
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:50,723
No!

1072
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:56,052
What is this?

1073
01:15:15,066 --> 01:15:17,266
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

1074
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:19,411
Why are you wearing these?

1075
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,034
If you don't send me the money
this week, I'll file a suit.

1076
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:25,268
Why is nothing going right?

1077
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,715
Are you here to take the strength
test for the cleaning company?

1078
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:30,479
I sent you to the US for treatment.

1079
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:31,865
And what am I hearing? A cleaning company?

1080
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:33,546
You haven't changed a bit...

1081
01:15:33,697 --> 01:15:35,064
...since I was little.

1082
01:15:35,467 --> 01:15:37,978
You got hurt too.

1083
01:15:38,193 --> 01:15:39,527
Did you hear that we have new employees?

1084
01:15:39,857 --> 01:15:42,057
One of them is supposed to be super weird.

1085
01:15:43,235 --> 01:15:44,268
I'm doomed.

1086
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:59,021
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
