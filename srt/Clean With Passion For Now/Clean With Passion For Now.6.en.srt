1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,067
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,567
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,200
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:17,168
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,102
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:35,001
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,727
This must be covered with germs now.

8
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,915
No one knows how to clean properly.

9
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,139
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Jang.

10
00:01:03,117 --> 00:01:06,074
You are in love.

11
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,102
No.

12
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:10,437
No.

13
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,193
No! No way!

14
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,848
No! I'm not.

15
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,825
Mr. Jang is acting so strange lately.

16
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:44,333
He suddenly grabbed
an employee who was filthy,

17
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,574
from head to toe
with his bare hands.

18
00:01:46,668 --> 00:01:48,713
But today, he treated her like a germ...

19
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,769
...and sprayed disinfectant on her
even when she washed her hair.

20
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,213
I knew that he could be a weirdo,

21
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,909
but he's really unpredictable these days.

22
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,413
He gets angry, apologizes,
and suddenly feels happy again.

23
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,073
Then he yells. What's with him?
Is he crazy or what?

24
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:06,195
They say that love makes everyone crazy.

25
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,783
That documentary showcased
a famous line from a movie.

26
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,758
"Love makes everyone crazy."

27
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:20,414
"It's a socially accepted form of madness,
but it is still crazy."

28
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:22,433
My, I just sounded so cool.

29
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:24,522
Isn't it awesome?
I'll say it to Eun Hee later on.

30
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,801
Is Mr. Jang out of his mind?

31
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,990
Gil O Sol, of all girls?

32
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,020
-What's wrong with O Sol?
-Yes, what's wrong with her?

33
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:35,536
Gosh, don't you guys know?

34
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,925
Anyway, O Sol can't be the reason.

35
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:41,294
There's no way he likes her.

36
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:43,639
Apologize to her.

37
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:46,881
Well, you know that it's made...

38
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,170
-...with all-natural ingredients...
-Will you not apologize to her?

39
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:54,146
I should. I will, but...

40
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:56,468
Excuses aren't necessary.

41
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,311
Apologize to her immediately.

42
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,913
Immediately?

43
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,402
Gosh, I'm busy right now...

44
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:09,655
"Apologize immediately when you
harm or inconvenience others."

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,557
Even my son in elementary
school knows that.

46
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:18,532
Okay.

47
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,139
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

48
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,460
There's no need.
This isn't even a big deal.

49
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,569
Thanks to him, everything's
been sterilized.

50
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:33,952
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,779
I apologize on his behalf.

52
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,325
He rarely makes mistakes like this.

53
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:40,905
I'm sure you know this by now,

54
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,280
but he has mysophobia.

55
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,526
I can't get into the details though.

56
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,826
I hope you can understand.

57
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:54,492
Don't hate him too much.

58
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:00,841
No...

59
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:03,246
...I like him.

60
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,883
Frankly, our first encounter
wasn't a pleasant one,

61
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:12,038
but since that day,

62
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,958
I've always thought that
he's probably a good person.

63
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,290
And...

64
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:33,292
This is beef bone soup.

65
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,624
I thought this would help him
recover from his injury faster.

66
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,673
Could you give it to him?

67
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,596
If I give it to him,
he'll get all uncomfortable.

68
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:43,420
No, you should give it to him directly.

69
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,292
That will be better.

70
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,859
I like him.

71
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,536
Frankly, our first encounter
wasn't a pleasant one,

72
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,336
but since that day,

73
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,658
I've always thought that
he's probably a good person.

74
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,791
What's she doing here at this hour?

75
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,758
Oh, Ms. Gil. What brings
you here at this hour?

76
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:04,898
I just wanted to give this to you.

77
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:08,822
It's beef bone soup. It's good for you.

78
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,368
I made this myself.

79
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,375
I only used Korean beef.

80
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:20,480
You don't have to accept it
if you don't want to eat it.

81
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,169
I love beef bone soup,

82
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,937
so there's a huge pot of it at home now.

83
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,336
I brought some for you just in case.

84
00:06:27,424 --> 00:06:30,574
At home, I have a gigantic pot full of...

85
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:38,203
It was rude of me to stop
by at this late hour,

86
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,137
wasn't it?

87
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,568
I'll get going.

88
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,691
I like you too!

89
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,457
-Pardon me?
-What?

90
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,409
No, I mean...

91
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:57,784
Beef bone soup.

92
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:59,734
I like it too.

93
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,225
I see.

94
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:20,588
It's that robot vacuum.

95
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,649
Your place is awesome.

96
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:33,724
Is there anything to clean?

97
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:37,257
It's working so hard.

98
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:46,925
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

99
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:57,544
Your place is bigger
than I thought it'd be.

100
00:07:59,057 --> 00:08:01,424
It must be a lot of work
to clean this place.

101
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,725
I have a housekeeper.

102
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,323
I guess she left for the day.

103
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,758
She cleans my place when I'm not home.

104
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:16,791
I don't like it when someone else
is here with me.

105
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,223
I see.

106
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:28,392
Make yourself at home.

107
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:31,158
Pardon? I feel so at home now.

108
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,258
You look very uncomfortable now.

109
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:36,459
I have to disinfect the whole place
after you leave anyway,

110
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,559
so just sit comfortably.

111
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:42,058
Okay. Then...

112
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,780
...I'll sit back.

113
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,127
Sure.

114
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:01,476
By the way, you said you
have something to tell me.

115
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,492
I'm sorry about earlier today.

116
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:13,991
I should've apologized to you sooner.

117
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,225
I know that this is late.

118
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,525
Then we're even now, right?

119
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,791
As you know, I've made...

120
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,414
...a lot of mistakes too.

121
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,691
Let's call it even.

122
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:33,412
I mean, if you're okay with it, that is.

123
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,903
-Gosh, it's hot!
-Are you all right?

124
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:55,658
-This. Use this to...
-No, it's okay.

125
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,558
I'm fine, so don't worry.

126
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:01,136
I'll just go get changed.

127
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,069
No, I'll be leaving shortly,
so you don't need to get changed.

128
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,794
Well, I'm not getting changed...

129
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:08,769
...to show you.

130
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,826
I'm doing it because it bothers me.

131
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,225
I'll be right back.

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,734
It must be hard.

133
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,891
Washing up and getting changed
multiple times throughout the day.

134
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:27,025
And maintaining this level
of cleanliness both at home and work...

135
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,159
...must require a lot of time and effort.

136
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:34,594
I suddenly thought that
it must be very hard.

137
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:37,526
No, not really.

138
00:10:38,691 --> 00:10:39,791
I'm used to it.

139
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:44,647
Why?

140
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:46,812
Do I seem fussy to you?

141
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:48,203
No.

142
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:51,170
To be honest,
I did think that about you...

143
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,525
...when we first met...

144
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:55,758
...but not anymore.

145
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,325
I'm sure there's a reason for it.

146
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:04,158
Just like me.

147
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,724
This will sound like an excuse,

148
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:12,390
I thought even taking showers was a luxury
when I had multiple part-time jobs.

149
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,566
I gave up washing my hair...

150
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,086
...and got 10 more minutes of sleep...

151
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:21,965
...and I gave up changing
to fresh clothes to study more.

152
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:27,192
Living like that for a while
turned it into a habit.

153
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:29,825
I'm sure your reason is different,

154
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:32,858
but you must have a
legitimate reason as well.

155
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,557
Everyone has a story, you know.

156
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:48,758
That hairstyle suits you much better.

157
00:11:49,257 --> 00:11:52,891
I think it makes you more approachable.

158
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:54,124
Am I wrong?

159
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:57,948
I should get going.

160
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:00,486
-I'll clean this since I drank it.
-No, no.

161
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,064
You can just leave it there.

162
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:04,535
No. You can't even use your hand.

163
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,657
I'll leave after washing this.

164
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:09,348
I'm a well-mannered person.

165
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,957
Let me wash yours too.

166
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:14,490
Ms. Gil, it's really okay.

167
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,879
Take your time and change.

168
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:17,691
Is the sink over there?

169
00:12:18,558 --> 00:12:19,825
Wait.

170
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:43,791
(The Love)

171
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:46,958
Where's the detergent?

172
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,458
There's nothing here.

173
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:54,371
No.

174
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,224
No!

175
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:17,925
Ms. Gil O Sol, stop!

176
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:24,490
What?

177
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:29,244
Well...

178
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:30,977
What's wrong?

179
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,194
The water got cut off.

180
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:39,765
There's no water right now.

181
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,858
Oh, okay.

182
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,591
Then how did you wash your hair?

183
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:50,958
I used bottled water.

184
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,666
Bottled water.

185
00:13:55,591 --> 00:13:56,937
What about the laundry?

186
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:58,526
Bottled water.

187
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,058
Well, then...

188
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:04,770
...should I use bottled water too?

189
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:07,158
Yes. But you can just go. It's okay.

190
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,791
Just go. It's late. You should go home.

191
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:11,724
Hold on!

192
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:13,998
-Bye.
-Mr. Jang!

193
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:16,610
I didn't even say goodbye properly.

194
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:21,185
What's with him?

195
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,739
(The Love)

196
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:37,691
I must be going crazy.

197
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,544
Hi.

198
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,213
This is Daniel.

199
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:48,421
I need some information on a patient.

200
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,423
He was under the care of Dr. Fore.

201
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:55,455
His name is Jang Seon Gyeol.

202
00:14:56,424 --> 00:15:02,058
He was admitted for OCD treatment
back in 2012.

203
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:05,963
I've sent you the rest of
the information by e-mail.

204
00:15:06,057 --> 00:15:08,674
So please check and...

205
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,209
...get back to me.

206
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,724
Okay. Thanks.

207
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,213
I haven't eaten at home...

208
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:51,291
...in ages.

209
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:54,454
Right?

210
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,564
Thank you for the food.

211
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,090
It tastes good.

212
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,291
Do I look better...

213
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,658
when my hair is down?

214
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,340
No.

215
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:51,591
A man should use pomade.

216
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,870
A CEO needs pomade.

217
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,692
I'm a CEO.

218
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,715
Dong Hyeon is so lucky to be away
from work on a day like this.

219
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,236
But he usually never takes a day off.

220
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,770
-Do you have some time today?
-What's gotten into him?

221
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,036
I can come to you after work.
Let's eat something nice.

222
00:17:08,124 --> 00:17:10,536
Sorry, but I have some
important plans today.

223
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:11,564
Is it Eun Hee again?

224
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:15,539
You get turned down every time,
but you never seem to give up.

225
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,940
I guess you're still young.

226
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,002
Is it Room 1004?

227
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,381
How many times do I have to tell you?

228
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,022
Take these.

229
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:24,171
Watch your head.

230
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,131
Anything else?

231
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:30,726
Do we have everything?

232
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,451
What?

233
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,332
Yes, I think so.

234
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,091
Yeong Sik, do you want to go ahead?

235
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:43,904
I need to use the bathroom first.

236
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,958
(Sponges)

237
00:17:57,357 --> 00:17:58,636
What is he doing with Eun Hee?

238
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,603
Yeong Sik, I'm sure...

239
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,525
...it's not what you think it is.

240
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,369
Don't you know Dong Hyeon
has no interest in girls at all?

241
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,736
He's like a monk. He's completely...

242
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:08,857
Hey!

243
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,024
Do I need a reason to not like someone?

244
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,293
I just don't like him.

245
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:21,350
I'm not sure if I should say this,

246
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,469
but it's actually kind of
embarrassing that he likes me.

247
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:28,503
All he can do is hit on me.

248
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,445
He is not considerate at all.
It's just too much at times.

249
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,235
You can tell me all the nice
things about him if you want,

250
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,391
but I won't change my mind.

251
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,571
I'm not interested.

252
00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:50,257
Yeong Sik.

253
00:18:51,457 --> 00:18:52,398
Hi.

254
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:00,916
Yes.

255
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:03,085
I can do it alone.

256
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:04,736
It's a small apartment,

257
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:07,124
and a private home is not
that difficult to clean.

258
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,102
Sure.

259
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:12,485
I'll call you when I'm done.

260
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:13,842
Bye.

261
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:41,336
Who are you?

262
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,925
Hello, I'm from Cleaning Fairy.

263
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,692
You booked a cleaning today, right?

264
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:49,091
Oh, yes.

265
00:19:49,546 --> 00:19:51,870
I'm actually heading out.

266
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,559
I see.

267
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,636
You can take your time.

268
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,603
I can send you some
pictures when I'm done.

269
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,366
Oh, okay.

270
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,270
Bye.

271
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,787
I can do this.

272
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:06,465
I'm sorry.

273
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,468
I guess I should have told you directly.

274
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:12,603
Also, when I said it's
embarrassing, I didn't mean...

275
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,173
Yes, I know.

276
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:19,916
I only cared about my feelings
and made you uncomfortable.

277
00:21:22,858 --> 00:21:23,849
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,952
You know I'm a simple person.

279
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,424
I have some work.

280
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,762
I have to go now.

281
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,080
Wait, Yeong Sik.

282
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:46,258
That uniform looks great on you.

283
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,642
Just as great as a taekwondo uniform.

284
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,092
I'll get going.

285
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:21,774
I knew...

286
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:26,786
...Eun Hee didn't like me.

287
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:30,925
I just thought...

288
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:36,188
...if I kept staying by her side...

289
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:39,292
...maybe she would...

290
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,325
...start liking me someday.

291
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,824
I'm not as charming...

292
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:54,206
...or half as good looking as you...

293
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,912
...but I'm a very persistent guy.

294
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:00,492
I thought that I had a chance.

295
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:03,825
It's just like that time
during our sports day.

296
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,492
Although I lacked speed,

297
00:23:07,758 --> 00:23:11,225
I was good at enduring anything.

298
00:23:17,025 --> 00:23:18,031
But...

299
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:22,835
I guess I can't change someone's
feelings by just enduring.

300
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,658
The more I clung on to Eun Hee,

301
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,791
it must've been tough for her.

302
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,892
I feel so sorry.

303
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,557
If Eun Hee...

304
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,091
...said something that straightforwardly...

305
00:23:49,391 --> 00:23:51,259
...she probably gave it a lot of thought.

306
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:58,224
She's soft-hearted.

307
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:02,919
She's so kind...

308
00:24:04,724 --> 00:24:06,558
...that she never badmouths people easily.

309
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:17,091
This short temper of mine is the problem.

310
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,366
Why did I go there in the first place?

311
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,091
I envy you.

312
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,899
For being so simple-minded.

313
00:24:31,184 --> 00:24:32,551
I envy that innocent side of yours.

314
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,625
There's no need to come.

315
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,925
I'm almost finished up here,
so don't worry about it.

316
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,024
You should go home and have a drink.

317
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:02,801
All right.

318
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:11,211
Okay.

319
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,924
(Hyosong Nursing Hospital)

320
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:09,726
(Hyosong Nursing Hospital)

321
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,759
Here you go. Thank you.

322
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:19,269
You changed your hairstyle.

323
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:23,521
Well, since it's raining and all.

324
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:28,958
All teams are out working except
for those under training,

325
00:26:29,124 --> 00:26:32,558
and it's Dong Hyeon's day off,
so Ms. Gil went to Sangwol-dong alone.

326
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:34,832
Okay.

327
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,670
It's an apartment complex in Sangwol-dong,

328
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,898
so she can probably handle it on her own.

329
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:40,966
I see.

330
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,657
An apartment complex...

331
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,420
...in Sangwol-dong?

332
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:54,373
Yes.

333
00:26:54,684 --> 00:26:55,535
Why?

334
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:56,937
Is there a problem?

335
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,659
What's the address of the place
Ms. Gil has gone to?

336
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,070
Hold on.

337
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:02,187
No.

338
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:04,824
I'll look into it.

339
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:09,574
Ms. Kwon. Send me the blacklist
of our clients...

340
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:11,091
...right away.

341
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:12,891
Do it now.

342
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,791
(Blacklisted Client List)

343
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,288
It's Sibeom Apartment
in Sangwol-dong, Seoul.

344
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:34,158
(Sexual harassment on female helper
on June and August 2017)

345
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,848
Did you check the client blacklist?

346
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:04,825
Mr. Jang.

347
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:10,091
Gosh, what is all this?

348
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,390
Seriously.

349
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,658
What's all this under the bed?

350
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,303
Why are the lights off?

351
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:29,224
(Open, lock)

352
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,624
I thought you were busy.

353
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:49,127
Are you back already?

354
00:29:04,724 --> 00:29:06,703
The phone is turned off.

355
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,725
Please leave a message after the beep.

356
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,058
Extra fees will be charged...

357
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:11,461
Ms. Gil!

358
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:14,257
Ms. Gil!

359
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:19,625
Ms. Gil O Sol!

360
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:23,236
Who are you?

361
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,457
Why do you keep pounding on my door?

362
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:29,257
You jerk.

363
00:30:33,214 --> 00:30:34,223
Ms. Gil.

364
00:30:35,658 --> 00:30:37,470
Ms. Gil! Gil O Sol.

365
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:38,603
Gosh...

366
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:40,992
Gil O Sol.

367
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,110
Mr. Jang.

368
00:30:49,357 --> 00:30:50,283
Ms. Gil.

369
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:54,547
Are you all right?

370
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:55,987
Sorry?

371
00:31:05,057 --> 00:31:08,470
Who are you to barge into
my place and punch me?

372
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:09,434
What...

373
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:19,711
I'm...

374
00:31:36,642 --> 00:31:39,642
I can take the bus home.

375
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,659
Is your hand okay now?

376
00:31:58,501 --> 00:31:59,397
Blood!

377
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,307
Mr. Jang, you're bleeding.

378
00:32:07,517 --> 00:32:09,386
Could you pull over for a few minutes?

379
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,309
We should at least dress your wound.

380
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:30,644
Give me your hand for just a moment.

381
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,514
How did this happen?

382
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:54,824
You've been acting so strange these days.
Do you realize that?

383
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:07,024
Sorry about that.
I just wanted to dress your wound quickly.

384
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,184
Ms. Gil.

385
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,759
Can you give me your hand?

386
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,269
My hand?

387
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,241
I just...

388
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,854
...have to check something.

389
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:30,501
Oh, okay.

390
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:39,524
Here.

391
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:41,580
Well, if you're done checking,

392
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:43,258
I'll get going...

393
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:25,592
He said there's only one person
he can touch.

394
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:29,488
Gil O Sol was that person?

395
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:52,991
Cha Seok Hwan?

396
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:13,591
(Cha Seok Hwan)

397
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,411
("Jang Seon Gyeol Turns Out to Be
AG Group Cha Seok Hwan's Grandson")

398
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:36,092
Jang Seon Gyeol is
Cha Seok Hwan's grandson?

399
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,229
What was that about?

400
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:46,731
Why did he suddenly do that to me?

401
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,503
And why did I close my eyes?

402
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:10,758
Gosh.

403
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,362
Hang on.

404
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:22,377
Did he just make a move on me?

405
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:25,325
Does he like me?

406
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,435
I'm about to poop!

407
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:42,353
Goodness.

408
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:46,252
You've been in there for at least an hour.

409
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:48,326
What on earth are you doing in there?

410
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,403
You punk. Why are you yelling
at the top of your lungs?

411
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:54,770
I'm about to poop now,
but O Sol isn't coming out.

412
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:57,136
Just use the public washroom at the park.

413
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:59,102
Why should I? Our bathroom is right here!

414
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,837
Then go out and poop on some
newspaper or something.

415
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,241
Am I a dog?

416
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,224
Darn it. Hey, you'd better come out now.

417
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:07,212
-Come out at once.
-Wait, hold on.

418
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,903
How long ago did she go in there?

419
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:12,547
I don't know! It's been at least an hour.

420
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:14,570
What are you doing? Come out already!

421
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:16,259
An hour? My goodness.

422
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,956
We need an ambulance.
Call an ambulance now!

423
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:19,859
No, should we call the police first?

424
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,136
Why do we need to call the police?

425
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:23,436
Think about it, you idiot.
Your sister would never,

426
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:25,891
use the bathroom for this
long in the morning.

427
00:39:26,758 --> 00:39:28,436
We have to do something about this.
Pull this.

428
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:29,657
Pull it.

429
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:32,703
Stop farting! Hand off your butt.

430
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,703
-Okay, I heard you!
-Pull it on the count of three.

431
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,036
1, 2...

432
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,291
-Okay!
-Three!

433
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,263
-Gosh.
-Ouch.

434
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:41,703
Gosh, my back.

435
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:44,470
Darn it, I pooped.
I'm so annoyed right now.

436
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:45,801
That punk.

437
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,290
Hey, are you all right? Are you...

438
00:39:51,365 --> 00:39:53,068
What? What's wrong?

439
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,190
You...

440
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:55,696
Did you...

441
00:39:56,591 --> 00:39:57,896
...just take a shower?

442
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:00,225
What? Oh.

443
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:04,470
Last night,

444
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,459
it was too hot in my room.

445
00:40:07,624 --> 00:40:10,308
I'm still sweating.
Gosh, it feels so gross.

446
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,880
Dad, our electricity bill will be so high.
Don't jack up the heat.

447
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:15,803
Gosh, it's still so hot.

448
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:18,359
It's like a sauna in here. It's so hot.

449
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,526
Is she really okay?

450
00:40:44,691 --> 00:40:46,344
Is a dress too much?

451
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:56,991
I don't want to look like
I'm trying too hard.

452
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,359
What about this one?

453
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,465
Is your sister sick?

454
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,158
That's not it.

455
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,390
I think she's seeing someone.

456
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,198
She's seeing someone?

457
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,593
-Good morning.
-Hi.

458
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:28,916
I think my sister is seeing someone.

459
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:32,378
Hey, that's not true.

460
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:33,701
Isn't it time for school?

461
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,069
See?

462
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:42,881
I must be right.

463
00:41:44,307 --> 00:41:45,786
Dad, I'm leaving!

464
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,809
-Gosh, I feel sorry for that guy.
-Have a nice day!

465
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,947
O Sol of all girls?

466
00:41:57,123 --> 00:42:00,202
Kim, the Sangwol-dong serial sex offender,

467
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,658
-was arrested today.
-It's that guy, right?

468
00:42:02,762 --> 00:42:05,622
That's right.
He did seem a bit suspicious.

469
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:08,269
By the way, who punched his face?

470
00:42:08,357 --> 00:42:10,169
He has committed multiple
sexual assaults...

471
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:13,636
-...against female cleaners.
-Serves him right.

472
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:16,091
What should I do with him? I'd love to...

473
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:07,584
Did you see the news?
The Sangwol-dong sexual offender.

474
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:11,689
Without you, it could have
happened to Ms. Gil too.

475
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:13,224
Good thing that you went there.

476
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,250
Mr. Jang?

477
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,618
What?

478
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:21,602
Were you saying something to me?

479
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:22,967
Is there something wrong?

480
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:25,666
No, not at all.

481
00:43:25,988 --> 00:43:27,226
Nothing is wrong.

482
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:30,477
You seem a little distracted.

483
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,879
I'm sorry. I have a lot on my mind.

484
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:37,183
Is there anything I can help you with?

485
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:39,124
No, I don't need your help.

486
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,131
It's something personal.
Something strictly personal.

487
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:48,026
I've been working for you
for the past five years,

488
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:50,749
and I'm seeing a different
side of you these days.

489
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:57,325
If you ever need my help,
feel free to let me know.

490
00:43:57,524 --> 00:44:00,624
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

491
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:04,225
Okay. I will.

492
00:44:06,454 --> 00:44:09,502
Should we start the inspection?

493
00:44:09,591 --> 00:44:10,509
Sure.

494
00:44:25,591 --> 00:44:28,269
I heard Mr. Jang barged
into a criminal's place...

495
00:44:28,357 --> 00:44:29,991
...to save one of the female
employee yesterday.

496
00:44:30,164 --> 00:44:33,302
Really? I'm so jealous.

497
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:36,192
By the way, who is that female employee?

498
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,870
-No idea. Do you have any idea?
-No.

499
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:40,692
It's me, you silly girls.

500
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,257
Whoever that is, I'm so jealous.

501
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,524
It's me.

502
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:52,925
O Sol, what's with you today?

503
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:55,320
What's with that lace that
looks like cockroach wings?

504
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:57,542
Wait, you're even wearing lipstick!

505
00:44:57,658 --> 00:45:00,303
Gosh, stop it.

506
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:02,366
It's not for you.

507
00:45:02,815 --> 00:45:04,249
That means it's for someone else.

508
00:45:04,356 --> 00:45:06,103
Who is it for? Who?

509
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,203
You can tell me.

510
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,358
-There you go again.
-Who is this person?

511
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:10,658
Seriously.

512
00:45:15,224 --> 00:45:16,291
What's with him?

513
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:19,358
Yesterday, his crush
came to an end after years.

514
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:21,937
Thinking it was still love,
he's wallowing.

515
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:23,050
My goodness.

516
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:26,351
Clean this area again.

517
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:29,836
-Hello.
-Clean those stains again.

518
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:30,992
Okay.

519
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:36,091
-Hello, Mr. Jang.
-Well...

520
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,666
Hello, Mr. Jang.

521
00:45:44,424 --> 00:45:45,491
Hi.

522
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,257
Wait.

523
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,666
-Ms. Gil.
-Yes?

524
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:13,957
Wipe that surface again.

525
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:16,112
Again?

526
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:28,591
Is he feeling shy
in front of other people?

527
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:32,356
I'll wipe it again.

528
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:52,543
A coach from Hanguk University is here.

529
00:46:52,632 --> 00:46:54,133
This match might change your life.

530
00:46:54,324 --> 00:46:55,624
Show him everything you have.

531
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,992
Ms. Gil.

532
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,971
About yesterday...

533
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,048
-Aren't I amazing?
-What?

534
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:41,182
You almost fell again.

535
00:47:41,271 --> 00:47:43,561
Gosh, you're so clumsy.

536
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:45,503
You didn't wash your hair this morning?

537
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:48,025
-I did.
-No way.

538
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:50,915
Hello, Mr. Jang.

539
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:55,158
Hi.

540
00:48:08,195 --> 00:48:09,362
Jae Min.

541
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:11,654
What's with your nails?

542
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:12,723
My nails?

543
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,191
My nails...

544
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,603
As a cleaner, you should
always keep yourself clean.

545
00:48:17,691 --> 00:48:19,125
Look how dirty your nails are!

546
00:48:20,245 --> 00:48:21,968
I'm sorry. I'll clean them right away.

547
00:48:22,057 --> 00:48:24,624
-Ms. Gil.
-Yes?

548
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:27,633
Don't try to carry more than you can.

549
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:30,389
Because you're so careless,
you keep hurting yourself.

550
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,257
What?

551
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,584
Well, okay. I'm sorry.

552
00:48:41,224 --> 00:48:42,291
Why are you staring at me?

553
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:45,558
Your nails.

554
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:01,525
What a jerk.

555
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:04,938
What's with the way he speaks?

556
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,224
Is he worried or angry?

557
00:49:08,525 --> 00:49:10,026
Is that his new way of nagging us?

558
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:20,563
Are you sick? Your face is all red.

559
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:23,090
It's red?

560
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,725
I might be coming down with a cold.
Let me carry one.

561
00:49:28,624 --> 00:49:31,624
Hey, you should treat it
in the beginning. Come here.

562
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,472
You don't seem to have a fever though.

563
00:49:34,726 --> 00:49:35,738
It's just oily.

564
00:49:35,827 --> 00:49:37,894
-Gosh.
-When did you wash your hair?

565
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:39,353
It's none of your business.

566
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,525
You should start washing
your hair more often.

567
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:45,225
I washed it this morning.

568
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:54,191
I should have fired him that day.

569
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:03,927
What? You kissed?

570
00:50:06,357 --> 00:50:08,258
Hey, aren't you talking about a dream?

571
00:50:09,357 --> 00:50:10,624
No.

572
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:13,791
Hey.

573
00:50:15,025 --> 00:50:16,937
But it's so strange.

574
00:50:17,025 --> 00:50:18,536
I thought your CEO had mysophobia.

575
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:20,303
But he kissed you?

576
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:21,625
Not the other way around?

577
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:24,036
Do you think I'm insane to kiss him twice?

578
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:26,969
I guess. Twice would be just
like an organized crime.

579
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,826
Then why on earth?

580
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:32,939
Hey. Maybe he has
a strange taste for women.

581
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,670
Anyway, this is awesome, O Sol.

582
00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:39,147
Your CEO might be into you.

583
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:40,600
This is unbelievable.

584
00:50:41,925 --> 00:50:43,670
Let's not jump to conclusions.

585
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:45,870
There's a quote, "A new car
follows after a beat-up car."

586
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:48,025
In this case, can we say he's a super car?

587
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:50,770
So, did he tell you how he feels?
Did he ask you out?

588
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:52,570
When did it all start?

589
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,359
He didn't say anything like that.

590
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:55,684
He didn't?

591
00:50:57,404 --> 00:51:00,603
Well, I guess. Who says something
cheesy like that nowadays?

592
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:02,958
No one actually asks
if they want to go out.

593
00:51:03,057 --> 00:51:04,636
That kiss was more than enough.

594
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:07,658
Then will you go on dates
after work from now on?

595
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:09,858
I'm so jealous of you.

596
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:11,814
Dates?

597
00:51:14,057 --> 00:51:15,491
He didn't say that either.

598
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,992
He didn't ask you out on a date?

599
00:51:28,891 --> 00:51:30,403
You have to make things clear.

600
00:51:30,491 --> 00:51:32,691
Don't become a total fool like
when Lee Do Jin used you.

601
00:51:43,291 --> 00:51:46,058
If you're at the office,
do you have time to meet?

602
00:51:46,224 --> 00:51:47,658
I have something to say.

603
00:51:51,638 --> 00:51:52,657
What's it about?

604
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,058
Yesterday...

605
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,592
I'll tell you in person.

606
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,126
I'm out of the office.

607
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:09,149
If it isn't urgent,
let's talk later at night.

608
00:52:14,025 --> 00:52:16,092
When do you have time tonight?

609
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:17,524
What are you doing?

610
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:18,469
What?

611
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,125
I'm going for a drink with Yeong Sik
after work. You're coming, right?

612
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,580
You mean tonight?

613
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:29,946
Yes. Is something wrong?

614
00:52:30,035 --> 00:52:32,202
No. Nothing is wrong.

615
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:35,092
Then get changed and come out.
We'll be waiting outside.

616
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:46,058
No, it's not urgent,
so I'll just ask you next time.

617
00:52:53,324 --> 00:52:55,357
What are you doing here?

618
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:58,225
Who told you?

619
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:03,191
I thought you'd never have
to visit the hospital,

620
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:05,192
but I guess you're not
an exception either.

621
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,965
Didn't I tell you not to let
anyone enter this room?

622
00:53:14,106 --> 00:53:16,273
I was worried after hearing
you were hospitalized,

623
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:19,636
but I can tell you're okay
from the way you talk.

624
00:53:19,724 --> 00:53:23,558
If you came to visit me,
just sit down and be quiet,

625
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:25,894
and if that's not the case,

626
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:28,102
just leave now.

627
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:29,876
I'm going to leave soon anyway.

628
00:53:30,183 --> 00:53:32,235
I have an important meeting
with an investor today.

629
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:33,791
Why don't you stop playing...

630
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:36,515
...with that silly cleaning
agency of yours...

631
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,357
...and come work at a real company now?

632
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:41,969
Do you want to see your grandpa die?

633
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:43,803
You need to be the
successor of this group.

634
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,692
When are you going to live like that?

635
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:48,423
Didn't you say you have no intent...

636
00:53:48,677 --> 00:53:50,369
...of passing on your company
to someone with a flaw?

637
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:51,826
You must fix it!

638
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,254
You'll have to fix it.

639
00:53:53,381 --> 00:53:56,903
If you don't, will you be able
to live as a normal person?

640
00:53:57,138 --> 00:53:59,191
Think about your age.

641
00:53:59,363 --> 00:54:01,570
You should start dating like others...

642
00:54:01,731 --> 00:54:03,599
...and get married too.

643
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:06,121
Is this what they call...

644
00:54:06,735 --> 00:54:09,139
..."Carrying fire in one hand
and water in the other?"

645
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,669
I feel very grateful for your wise words,

646
00:54:11,758 --> 00:54:14,570
but I'm not thinking of
dating due to my mom,

647
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:16,392
who changes her boyfriend
almost every day.

648
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,027
And as you can see, I'm a flawed person...

649
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,391
...so I can't get married either.

650
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,030
-What?
-So Grandpa,

651
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:25,496
don't die.

652
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,532
It's probably not a fatal disease anyway.

653
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:35,891
Seon Gyeol. When did you come?

654
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,025
We've met again, Mae Hwa's son.

655
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:41,352
Hello.

656
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:46,356
Seon Gyeol. Seon Gyeol!

657
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:50,422
Goodness, Mr. Cha.

658
00:54:52,001 --> 00:54:53,111
It's an honor to meet you.

659
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:58,057
Sir.

660
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:01,475
Dad, what did you say to him this time?

661
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,365
I can't stand the sight of all of you,

662
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:05,231
so get out.

663
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:27,471
She was in pain all day...

664
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,660
...and she has finally become stabilized.

665
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,074
Give them some coffee and bread.

666
00:55:54,163 --> 00:55:55,176
Thank you very much.

667
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:57,599
Please take good care of Chairman Cha.

668
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,392
-Let's go that way.
-Yes, sir.

669
00:56:03,124 --> 00:56:05,369
Now you're even dating a gangster?

670
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:08,092
I told you last time he's
in the resort business.

671
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,223
I see.

672
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:12,458
You introduced so many guys
to me, and I got confused.

673
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:14,683
This is really my last time.

674
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:17,306
Chairman Yang is so charming,
the more I get to know him.

675
00:56:17,686 --> 00:56:18,819
Of course he is.

676
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:21,354
I've always heard you say
that exact same thing.

677
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,926
Why are you picking a fight
with me no matter what I say?

678
00:56:24,015 --> 00:56:26,261
What's the problem with liking someone?

679
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,837
Liking someone is not wrong.

680
00:56:27,925 --> 00:56:30,236
-Then what?
-Forcing me is wrong.

681
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:33,136
Forcing? When did I force anything on you?

682
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:35,269
I've seen your new
boyfriends as often as...

683
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:37,457
...I've seen you since I was a child.

684
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:38,724
Am I wrong?

685
00:56:39,891 --> 00:56:42,325
You kept introducing strangers to me...

686
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:44,991
...and told me to be nice
since he might become my father.

687
00:56:45,925 --> 00:56:48,403
But I don't even know who my father is.

688
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:49,439
That's...

689
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:51,824
...because I was...

690
00:56:52,524 --> 00:56:55,069
...really sincere back then.

691
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:56,179
Thanks to you,

692
00:56:57,057 --> 00:57:00,858
I've learned that feeling
is the most pathetic thing in the world.

693
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:05,695
So, have you two shared
a fruitful conversation?

694
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:07,539
Well?

695
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,181
What's wrong with this mood?

696
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,045
Why are my feelings pathetic?

697
00:57:13,357 --> 00:57:16,058
Although they change from time
to time, I really meant it!

698
00:57:23,758 --> 00:57:26,303
That's why you should start dating too.

699
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:28,225
Nothing goes the way you want.

700
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:31,958
That is why I don't date.

701
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:35,624
I don't want to become
a laughing stock like you.

702
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:38,322
What?

703
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:43,036
The truth is, you can't date!

704
00:57:43,124 --> 00:57:45,036
Even your own mom can't handle you.

705
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:46,758
You're so annoying.

706
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:48,483
You annoying little punk!

707
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:52,390
He totally looks down on his own mom.

708
00:57:54,124 --> 00:57:55,625
He's so mean.

709
00:57:57,526 --> 00:57:59,378
What is Mr. Jang thinking?

710
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:02,292
He hasn't contacted me the whole day.

711
00:58:48,996 --> 00:58:51,361
I guess you had a busy day.

712
00:58:53,591 --> 00:58:55,092
Right, you're a busy man.

713
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:02,725
Oh, I was with my colleagues.

714
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:04,625
Yeong Sik's crush rejected him,

715
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,091
so we had drinks together.

716
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,058
Well, Mr. Jang.

717
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,158
Do you have anything to say to me?

718
00:59:24,925 --> 00:59:26,292
Well, what I'm asking is...

719
00:59:28,877 --> 00:59:31,877
About what happened yesterday.

720
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:34,559
We should talk about it.

721
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:44,081
I'm sorry,

722
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:47,726
but I'm not in the mood to talk about it.

723
00:59:50,624 --> 00:59:51,991
Let's talk another time.

724
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,125
I'll get going.

725
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:00,025
Wait.

726
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:09,165
How could you always do whatever you want?

727
01:00:14,171 --> 01:00:16,680
Regardless of your mood today...

728
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:19,158
...you could...

729
01:00:23,524 --> 01:00:27,225
...at least say a few words
about our kiss last night.

730
01:00:35,824 --> 01:00:38,625
What do you want to hear from me?

731
01:00:44,496 --> 01:00:45,335
Why?

732
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,758
Were you expecting me
to ask you to be my girlfriend?

733
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:54,557
-What did you just say?
-I have no interest in dating.

734
01:00:56,558 --> 01:00:58,059
Right now, I don't even
want to date anyone.

735
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:11,624
Is that enough of an answer for you?

736
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:21,842
Let's go.

737
01:02:11,524 --> 01:02:13,758
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

738
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,670
I, too, have no interest
in dating at the moment.

739
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:18,236
Especially with a guy like you.

740
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:21,303
Her name is Gil O Sol.
She's one of our new hires.

741
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:24,825
Mr. Jang started changing
when she joined the company.

742
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:26,778
Did you quit hurdling for this stupid job?

743
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:29,669
You said you were looking for a good job.
What is this mess?

744
01:02:29,758 --> 01:02:31,102
Do you like her?

745
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,269
Enough to protect her?

746
01:02:33,357 --> 01:02:35,169
You must be heading out
to confess to your first love.

747
01:02:35,257 --> 01:02:37,536
If your feelings are sincere,

748
01:02:37,624 --> 01:02:39,448
you can worry about the consequences,

749
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:42,162
when they actually happen.

750
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:56,865
