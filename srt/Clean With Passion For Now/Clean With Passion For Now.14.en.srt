1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,067
(O Sol's Room)

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,200
(Kim Yoojung)

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:12,233
(Yoon Kyunsang)

4
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,101
(Song Jaerim)

5
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,101
(Yooseon)

6
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,234
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

7
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,334
I know, right? Totally.

8
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,183
Come here.

9
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,835
You have bread all over your face.

10
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,335
You have a milk mustache,
ones that kids get.

11
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,367
A milk mustache?

12
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,133
You mean, right here?

13
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,567
Did you leave it there
on purpose to make me...

14
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,067
...wipe it for you?

15
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,133
No, I didn't.

16
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,567
I think it's gone.

17
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,434
Hang on.

18
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,167
Come here.

19
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,567
You're so cute.

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,467
What was that about?

21
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:12,968
You're dead meat now.

22
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,168
-What is it? What's wrong?
-Well...

23
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,700
...I meant to call my dad last night...

24
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,302
...but I totally forgot about it.

25
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:27,768
Your dad?

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,100
Wait, just a second.

27
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,567
Hold on. I'll drive you home.

28
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,312
Gosh, no. It's okay.

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,301
I'll get in deeper trouble
if he finds out we were together.

30
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,201
-I'll call you, okay?
-But...

31
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,001
Wait, Ms. Gil...

32
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:52,434
Have another amazing day!

33
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,801
Amazing day to you too.

34
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,208
Oh, dear.

35
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:27,235
Look at you. You didn't come home
last night and didn't even call.

36
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,780
Did you do this all the time in Busan?

37
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,235
I see you haven't left for school yet.

38
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,406
Where's Dad?

39
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Where on earth did you sleep last night?

40
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,502
Well... Dad.

41
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,601
At Ju Yeon's!

42
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,880
I slept at Ju Yeon's place.

43
00:05:05,968 --> 00:05:08,068
Where else do you think I was all night?

44
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,867
Hey, Ju Yeon.

45
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,235
Did O Sol sleep at your place last night?

46
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,500
Yes, she passed out
after having beer with fried chicken.

47
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,868
Why? Didn't she call you?

48
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,501
Well, never mind. Thanks anyway.

49
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,468
You get drunk and pass out all the time.

50
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,934
What's your cell phone for?

51
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,734
I'm sorry, Dad.

52
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:41,635
I meant to call you but
totally forgot about it.

53
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:43,935
Wash up and eat breakfast.

54
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,266
I'm making braised mackerel.

55
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,923
-What?
-Come to your senses, will you?

56
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
You're so out of it these days
because of your boyfriend.

57
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,413
Thanks so much, Ju Yeon.

58
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,801
My gosh, I should take Ju Yeon
out for a nice meal.

59
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:13,836
-Hello.
-How can she be so quick-witted?

60
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:18,501
Wait, it sounds like
you've done this many times.

61
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,967
No, that's not true.

62
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:25,301
You must have nothing better to do.

63
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,568
You keep trying to pick fights with me.

64
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,602
Gosh, you're so cute even
when you're trying to argue with me.

65
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:34,146
I miss you. What do I do?
I miss you too much.

66
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,634
How am I going to wait?

67
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,667
Hold on second.

68
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,334
Did you feel my love for you?

69
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,568
Yes, I felt it. It totally made me cringe.

70
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,601
I miss you too.

71
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,402
Have another great day.

72
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,135
You can do it!

73
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:06,993
Bye.

74
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,168
You're staying in Korea
for longer than I expected.

75
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,102
Did you decide to stay for good?

76
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,567
I'm still contemplating on it.

77
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:28,235
As you're probably guessing,
I asked you to come by...

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
...to see if you'd like to work with us.

79
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,201
Would you accept the offer?

80
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:36,173
Thanks for the offer,
but I'm not ready yet mentally.

81
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,634
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,635
I knew it. Did you decide
to go back to Rochester?

83
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:45,435
I heard a little while ago
that they offered you...

84
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:46,968
...an associate professor role.

85
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,868
That's not the only reason.

86
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:53,769
I want to lay low as I've been doing
for the next little while.

87
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,554
Also, there's a personal matter
I have to take care of.

88
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,101
Give it another thought.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,667
I'd hate to let such
a phenomenal doctor go.

90
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,567
Thank you for your kind words.

91
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,834
Hey, I have a favor to ask of you.

92
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:27,079
Goodness, they say that a fair face...

93
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,413
...may hide a foul heart.

94
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,534
So? Did you have a great time?

95
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,234
What did you two do all night?

96
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,146
Gosh, what are you thinking?

97
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,413
I've already told you. We ate ramyeon...

98
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,112
...and watched a movie together.

99
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,267
What? Come on.

100
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,301
Hey, what else did you guys do
after watching the movie?

101
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,501
What else did you do?

102
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,527
What's with that look?

103
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:51,001
Hey, what you're thinking did not happen.

104
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,701
My goodness.

105
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,867
Anyway, you owe me big-time.
You know that, right?

106
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,168
I want you to pay me back with interest.

107
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,780
Don't think I'll forget about it.

108
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:02,901
I know, of course.

109
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,235
Ju Yeon, you know
how much I love you, right?

110
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,444
You're so quick-witted...

111
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:11,679
...and pretty.

112
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,701
-Who will be the lucky guy?
-I know, right?

113
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,568
Hey, what's this?

114
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,834
This... Isn't it O Dol's?

115
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,546
It is his badge.

116
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:25,968
Oh, this?

117
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:30,534
O Dol dropped this,
so I've been holding onto it.

118
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,239
That clumsy punk. He treasures that badge.

119
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:36,780
What was he thinking?

120
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,469
Hey, I'll take it. I can give it to him...

121
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:42,797
I'll... I'll give it back to him.

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,693
Hey, you'll be late.

123
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:49,569
Shouldn't you get going? Check the time.

124
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,467
Right.

125
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:54,867
Mr. Jang must be waiting for me. I'm off.

126
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,401
Hey.

127
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,234
That smile...

128
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,668
It's giving me a bad feeling.

129
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,768
-Are you sure you lost it here?
-Yes.

130
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,934
It should be somewhere here, then.

131
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,194
Ms. Gil.

132
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:32,901
Ms. Gil.

133
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,234
Mr. Jang, you're here.

134
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,068
What are you looking for?

135
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,148
A tooth.

136
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
"A tooth"?

137
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:53,468
This boy lost his front tooth
that fell out yesterday.

138
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,895
We have to find it.

139
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:00,934
Are you her boyfriend?

140
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:02,834
"Boyfriend"?

141
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,467
Yes.

142
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,400
I am.

143
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,901
She is my girlfriend.

144
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,267
You cutie.

145
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,335
Play with me.

146
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,579
Is this your tooth?

147
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,311
Oh, thank you.

148
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,167
Let's go!

149
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,679
Let's go.

150
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:34,800
Bye.

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,434
Why are you staring at me?

152
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:47,934
I just remembered my childhood.

153
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:49,655
Your childhood?

154
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,979
Did you lose your tooth too?

155
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,401
No, that's not it.

156
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,212
It's about a trauma.

157
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,279
A trauma?

158
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:03,546
When I was little,
a girl flicked her booger...

159
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:06,101
...into my mouth.

160
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,668
I suddenly remembered it.

161
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,034
A booger into your mouth?

162
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,780
That's hilarious.

163
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,402
Is that what gave you mysophobia?

164
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:18,912
Stop laughing.

165
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,279
I'm talking about my trauma here.

166
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:22,646
Still, it's so funny.

167
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,834
How could her booger go into...

168
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,801
Actually, something similar
happened when I was little.

169
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,312
I still remember it clearly.

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,667
There was this boy...

171
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,502
...who was wearing shiny enamel shoes.

172
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:39,112
He walked up to me and
said, "Play with me."

173
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,600
At that moment, I flicked my booger,

174
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,001
and it went right into his mouth.

175
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,968
Do you know what happened next?

176
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,334
He passed out?

177
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,495
That's right.

178
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,579
But I saved him by giving
him mouth-to-mouth.

179
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:54,907
Isn't that incredible?

180
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,601
A mouth-to-mouth?

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mouth-to-mouth...

182
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,968
He was completely smitten by me.

183
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:07,834
He was smitten by you?

184
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:09,355
Yes.

185
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,700
After that day,
he came back day after day...

186
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:14,767
...and peeped at me.

187
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:17,646
He must have been shy.
He was hiding all the time.

188
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:18,945
He couldn't walk up to me.

189
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:19,874
Well...

190
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,735
What if he was scared,

191
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,146
not shy?

192
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,601
Why would he be scared?

193
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:31,451
I still remember his face
blushing with excitement.

194
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:39,868
Well...

195
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,467
How is your doll doing?

196
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:45,479
That dirty baby doll
you used to carry on your back.

197
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:48,801
I remember even that.

198
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:50,968
How do you know...

199
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:55,743
By any chance...

200
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,303
...are you...

201
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,807
...that boy?

202
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:02,035
Yes, I'm that boy.

203
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,767
Oh, my. I can't believe it.

204
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,333
Hold on.

205
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,840
You really...

206
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,643
...didn't like me...

207
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:15,855
...but were afraid of me?

208
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,201
Well, the thing is...

209
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,268
I think I liked you.

210
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,801
...I always have...

211
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:25,901
...liked you.

212
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,002
Unbelievable.

213
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,912
Is this our destiny?

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,901
What should I do?

215
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,568
I'm so happy.

216
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,646
I'm so happy.

217
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,168
This must be our destiny!

218
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,634
The booger girl is going to bed.

219
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:44,467
Goodnight, the enamel-shoes boy.

220
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:46,468
No more nightmares.

221
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,133
She is so cute.

222
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:19,934
So cute.

223
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:27,068
Gil O Sol is so cute!

224
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:06,101
What's all this? It's so dirty.

225
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,202
I keep finding more things.

226
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,200
It's Mom.

227
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,901
What is this?

228
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,569
What's gotten into her?

229
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,479
Did something happen?

230
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,435
Good morning.

231
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,262
What is it?

232
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,746
Is something wrong?

233
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:45,746
My sister...

234
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:46,867
Yes?

235
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,567
She is cleaning.

236
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,246
I'm scared.

237
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,249
Me too.

238
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,068
The water became so dirty.

239
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:03,335
Is this what I've been
covering myself every night?

240
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,720
More hot water.

241
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:11,934
It's warm.

242
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,101
This is more fun than I expected.

243
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:18,124
It feels so rewarding to watch
the blankets become clean.

244
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,934
It makes me happy to see you smile.

245
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:23,536
What?

246
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,813
I hope...

247
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,602
...you will always smile like today.

248
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:33,934
No matter what happens,

249
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:36,767
I hope you will always
be able to laugh it off.

250
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,102
Why are you suddenly saying that?

251
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:46,602
Well, every relationship is like that.

252
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,334
You can't always be happy.

253
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,413
No matter what is awaiting you,

254
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:53,613
always stay strong.

255
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,602
That's my advice.

256
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,001
I'm thirsty.

257
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,846
Do you want something to drink?

258
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,934
Sure.

259
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,953
(Youngwon Flowers)

260
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,679
(M24 Convenience Store)

261
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,346
(Youngwon Flowers)

262
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:21,467
These are...

263
00:19:24,634 --> 00:19:26,801
What were you doing here?

264
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,746
It's where my mom is...

265
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,068
Oh, that.

266
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,074
Mr. Gil must have left them there.

267
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,734
He is getting forgetful these days.

268
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,375
How many spoons?

269
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,800
It doesn't matter.

270
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,453
Well...

271
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:53,434
I wanted to tell you
before I tell anyone else.

272
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,479
I guess I didn't work
at Cleaning Fairy for nothing.

273
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,600
I never realized how big my room was.

274
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,368
I had no idea...

275
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,546
...cleaning can be so rewarding.

276
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:08,667
After meeting you,

277
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:12,505
I think I changed a lot.

278
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:15,502
As a better me.

279
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:25,834
I can't imagine a better
version of you than right now.

280
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,567
Really?

281
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:43,968
By the way, your mother told me...

282
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,400
...she felt sorry for last time...

283
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:50,513
...and said she couldn't
go to see you first.

284
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,668
I'm glad to hear that.

285
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,312
I hated it when she barged in suddenly.

286
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,467
Come on, don't be like that.

287
00:20:56,067 --> 00:20:58,834
Can't you approach your mother first...

288
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,068
...just this once?

289
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,166
Just this once. Okay?

290
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:08,846
Me?

291
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,835
-A little to the right.
-Okay.

292
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,579
-To the left.
-Come this way.

293
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,979
Move back a bit. A little more.

294
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,367
-To the left. Turn it this way.
-Like this?

295
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,234
Okay.

296
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,635
Seon Gyeol, how did you...

297
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,867
I just...

298
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,935
...needed some clothes.

299
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:32,301
Hello.

300
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:39,101
It looks...

301
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,267
...cooler than I thought.

302
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,635
-What?
-It looks cool.

303
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:46,446
Your shop.

304
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:47,601
Do you really think so?

305
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:51,012
I decorated this place from top to bottom.

306
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,367
Everything from the furniture
to the design concept.

307
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,713
Do you see that outfit over there?
I even designed that.

308
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,091
Do you want to see it?

309
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,968
I'm sorry. I know you're busy...

310
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:04,867
...and I'm being so silly.

311
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,567
Show it to me. It's all right.

312
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,300
Really?

313
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,034
Okay. Hold on. Stay right here.

314
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,279
This was even introduced
at a fashion week in Paris.

315
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,679
Do you know Miranda Kerr?

316
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,346
She said she would love
to try on my outfits.

317
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:30,567
-Gosh.
-This...

318
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,369
Yes, you're right.

319
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,302
The drawing you drew when you were a kid.

320
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,267
You sent it to me
when I was living in the States.

321
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,600
You got a compliment
at kindergarten for the first time.

322
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,834
It wasn't me.
Ms. Geum Ja probably sent it.

323
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,534
I was so thankful you were
being raised so well.

324
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:55,268
Right. I heard you were dating O Sol.

325
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,168
I really like her too.

326
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,746
She doesn't get discouraged easily...

327
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,435
...and she's bright and pretty.

328
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,767
Do you want to go to
Chairman Yang's resort together?

329
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,967
I'll tell him to disinfect
the place and invite you.

330
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,200
No...

331
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,868
Anywhere else besides my home
is still uncomfortable.

332
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:13,901
Do you...

333
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,468
...only have dates with her at your home?

334
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,001
-I do.
-Seriously?

335
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,768
Only at home?

336
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:28,968
What should we cook today?

337
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,200
Will this be okay?

338
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,356
I heard you met your mother.

339
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:48,035
Well... I just dropped by.

340
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,167
You acted like you wouldn't go.

341
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:52,867
But you did.

342
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:57,934
It's just, I needed
some new clothes and...

343
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,001
You told me to go meet her.

344
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,534
I'm proud.

345
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:09,734
Great job, Mr. Jang.

346
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,501
What are you doing?

347
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:14,202
-Complimenting you.
-Hey.

348
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,967
What are you doing?
You're treating me like a baby.

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,667
-O Sol...
-Wait.

350
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:25,434
This is the movie, "Be With You".

351
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,379
They're showing the director's cut again.

352
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,734
I really wanted to see
this again at the movie theater.

353
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:31,568
Do you want to go see it?

354
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,868
Yes, let's go and see it.

355
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,201
I really wanted to see that too.

356
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,668
What is it, "Be With You".

357
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,534
I wanted to see it too. Let's go then.

358
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,646
That's fine. Come to think of it,
I already saw it.

359
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:50,568
There's no need to go out
and see it again.

360
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,312
But it'll feel different
if you see it in a movie theater.

361
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,634
Let's go see it. We can go.

362
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:58,268
It's really fine.

363
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,713
It's not fine with me, so let's go.

364
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,435
I just really want to see it.

365
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,834
So, we can really go.

366
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:06,800
To the movie theater.

367
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:26,601
Why aren't there any people?

368
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,601
O Sol.

369
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:49,434
Mr. Jang. You came early.

370
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,768
Oh, I had plans nearby.

371
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:57,134
Let's go. I already bought the tickets.

372
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,901
How about some popcorn with our movie?

373
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:03,734
Popcorn? That sounds great.

374
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,134
-Let's go.
-Okay.

375
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,233
Dong Hyeon, Yeong Sik, get ready.

376
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,045
Hello.

377
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,934
-We'll have a caramel popcorn...
-Yes.

378
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:14,935
Do you want something to drink?

379
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:16,968
I'll have anything.

380
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,234
-We'll have coke.
-Okay. It's eight dollars.

381
00:26:21,634 --> 00:26:23,246
It's been so long since
I came to the theater.

382
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:26,035
Is that so? We can come often from now on.

383
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,667
What the heck...

384
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:30,579
The coke is spilling all over the place.
Goodness.

385
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:33,034
-Here is your popcorn.
-Sir, this isn't stopping.

386
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,400
It stopped!

387
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,968
-Sweet and refreshing coke.
-Thank you.

388
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:47,767
Give it to me.

389
00:26:52,634 --> 00:26:53,901
Jae Min, stand by.

390
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,500
Aren't those employees so weird?

391
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,168
His voice sounded just like Yeong Sik.

392
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:04,302
No way. Let's just go in
and watch the movie.

393
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:10,468
Wow! You two look great together.

394
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:14,334
I hope you lovebirds enjoy your movie...

395
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,068
...and have a great time.

396
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,535
-Did you wash your hair?
-Sorry?

397
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,446
Let's go and watch the movie. Let's go in.

398
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:24,634
Shall we?

399
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:26,800
You're dead.

400
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:33,434
Give me your bag.

401
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,768
But why aren't there...

402
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,501
...any people in here?

403
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,934
Oh, I heard there was a group reservation,

404
00:27:44,267 --> 00:27:46,868
but it was canceled.
I guess that's why it's empty.

405
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
Did you enjoy the movie?

406
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,401
I loved the big screen.

407
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,301
It felt so nice to be with
you at the movie theater.

408
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:01,735
Do you want to go watch
baseball next time?

409
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,834
I heard there are many concerts lately.

410
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,800
How about a concert?

411
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:10,834
A concert?

412
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,834
Why? Is a concert too much?

413
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:18,700
Of course not.

414
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,212
If you want to go, just ask me.

415
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,801
If you ask, of course...

416
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:26,934
...we can go.

417
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,868
Thank you for today.

418
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,868
It must've been tough
for all the other guys.

419
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:37,634
What do you mean?

420
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:42,767
You don't have to try so hard for me.

421
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,468
You don't have to rent
the whole theater...

422
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,334
...and clean it up like that.

423
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,167
You knew?

424
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,500
That place was totally empty on a weekend.

425
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,669
I'd be stupid not to know.

426
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:00,935
And the smell of that disinfectant.

427
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,601
I'm very familiar with it too, you know.

428
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,329
I'm sorry. I just...

429
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:12,706
...wanted to enjoy
an ordinary date with you.

430
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:16,401
Instead of eating and
watching movies at home,

431
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,467
I wanted to hold hands like this,
take walks together,

432
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,135
and go to the movie theater.

433
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:35,834
You're...

434
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,101
...going through a lot because of me.

435
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,301
Don't say that.

436
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,880
The fact that I have you
by my side like this...

437
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,368
...makes me so happy.

438
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,001
My gosh, how romantic.

439
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,334
You rented the entire theater
for your date?

440
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:01,068
I thought things like that
only happened in movies.

441
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:02,646
Stop making fun of me.

442
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:04,146
I'm not in the mood for this.

443
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:05,434
I'm not making fun of you.

444
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,634
I'm truly impressed.

445
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,734
But...

446
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,502
...I wonder what's gotten into you...

447
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,802
...for you to reach out to me first.

448
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:19,168
And you even gave me this delicious tea.

449
00:31:20,534 --> 00:31:23,268
Well, nothing really.

450
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:26,934
It's about my mysophobia.

451
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:28,834
Aren't you going to treat it?

452
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,467
I heard you're quite famous in the field.

453
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:36,402
That was a model answer. Impressive.

454
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:38,068
That was an excellent answer.

455
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:39,734
All right.

456
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,234
Are you now more willing...

457
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,846
...to change?

458
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:45,177
Not exactly,

459
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:47,496
but I find it uncomfortable.

460
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,667
These days, especially.

461
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,367
The fact that I'm different from others...

462
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,868
...felt like being a nuisance.

463
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,835
I've never felt like this before.

464
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,767
And what's the reason?

465
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,713
You've been fine with your lifestyle...

466
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,168
...all these years.

467
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,195
Why are you suddenly
uncomfortable with it?

468
00:32:11,284 --> 00:32:12,631
That's what I'm asking.

469
00:32:19,094 --> 00:32:20,695
It's because of Gil O Sol.

470
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,668
I want to change for her.

471
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,502
There are many things...

472
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,567
...I want to do with her.

473
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:38,302
It's a good change.

474
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,001
Regardless of the reason,

475
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:43,701
you're finally willing to change.

476
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:49,968
Then can I...

477
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,668
...go ahead and assume...

478
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:55,780
...that you're mentally ready
to do anything and everything...

479
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:57,734
...I ask you to do?

480
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,168
"Anything and everything"?

481
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:02,768
That's right.

482
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,301
Well...

483
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,502
-Sure.
-Okay!

484
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:15,768
Then starting today, we shall
work on fixing your problem.

485
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,513
Can you please get rid
of this plastic cover?

486
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:26,945
It's uncomfortable,

487
00:33:27,033 --> 00:33:28,880
and this sound really gets on my nerves.

488
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,646
No, no way. Don't remove it.
Don't you dare. You can't.

489
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,968
Didn't you say you need my help?
You have the wrong attitude.

490
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,246
By the way, where are we going now?

491
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:40,701
I'm taking you to...

492
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,700
How shall I describe it?

493
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,434
It's a little trip
for your cognitive behavioral therapy.

494
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:47,868
A trip?

495
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:51,668
We can also call it "training".

496
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,112
You don't need to help me.
Just go to work.

497
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,233
It's fine.

498
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,813
I'm done. Look.

499
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:10,959
Isn't it so clean?

500
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,301
I was the ace of my team
back at Cleaning Fairy.

501
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,767
Ace, my foot.

502
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,012
The owner of this car is very fussy.

503
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,601
He'll complain even if
there's a tiny bit of dust left...

504
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,034
Oh, my goodness.

505
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:27,846
You're thorough because you take after me.

506
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:28,934
We're done with this car.

507
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,279
What else can I clean?

508
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,667
We're done for the day.

509
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,038
Already?

510
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,713
Since we're done early,
how about we go for a bowl of udon?

511
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:40,468
Goodness, I knew that was your goal
when you volunteered to help me.

512
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,234
-How about this?
-Of course. Let's go.

513
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:52,735
This place looks a lot more romantic
than the photos I saw online.

514
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:56,934
Baby.

515
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,901
Are we going to sleep
together here tonight?

516
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,467
What? Sleep together? Here?

517
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,546
What? Why?

518
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,235
Why would we sleep here?

519
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:14,901
Hey, stop!

520
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:16,868
Stop right there!

521
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:21,912
Why did you clean your room?
It's not your mom's death anniversary.

522
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,701
Oh, I just thought it looked untidy.

523
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,767
I haven't been cleaning regularly,

524
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,646
saying I'm always tired and busy.

525
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:32,079
I don't want to be like that anymore.

526
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,367
I'm going to keep things tidy
and stop putting things off.

527
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:36,102
That's why I cleaned my room.

528
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,968
Do you like that guy that much?

529
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,379
-What?
-You never listened to me...

530
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,801
...when I nagged you about it.

531
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,802
But you've totally changed
since you started dating him.

532
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:54,267
That's not what it is.
Don't be silly, Dad.

533
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:57,112
Whatever. Then why are
your ears all red now?

534
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,467
Don't lie to my face.

535
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:03,634
This change...

536
00:36:03,868 --> 00:36:05,602
...makes me happy.

537
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,834
It gives me a relief.

538
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,901
So what's your plan now?

539
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,835
I mean, you quit your job.

540
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:18,501
You must have a plan.

541
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,579
For the time being,

542
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,767
I want to help you like I did today.

543
00:36:24,968 --> 00:36:26,936
I'm not saying I won't
do anything productive.

544
00:36:27,434 --> 00:36:29,035
I want to take some time...

545
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,667
...and figure out
what I really want to do.

546
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,502
Since I quit hurdling,

547
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:39,501
I haven't had a chance to
sit down and think about,

548
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:42,201
what I really want to do.

549
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:48,413
"I don't care what the job is.
I just want to get a job..."

550
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:50,002
"...so I can make enough money..."

551
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,467
"...to lead a decent life."

552
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,235
That's what I thought.

553
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,101
But I don't want to
live like that anymore.

554
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,001
I want to find out what I really like...

555
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,467
...and what I want to do...

556
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,767
...so I can enjoy my life.

557
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:11,268
That's why I want to
take the proper path...

558
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,635
...even though it may take longer.

559
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,200
I see.

560
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,801
If your mom heard that,
she'd be so happy for you.

561
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:28,100
The problem with O Dol
has been resolved too.

562
00:37:28,234 --> 00:37:30,701
Don't you feel like it
was a gift from Mom?

563
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,534
I miss her so much.

564
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:47,468
By the way, why did you visit Mom alone?

565
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:49,001
We could've come with you.

566
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,501
What?

567
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,846
Aren't you the one who left
the yogurt and the flowers?

568
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:55,246
What are you talking about?

569
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:58,202
I've been very busy, so I
haven't had time to visit her.

570
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,646
Speaking of which, I
should visit her soon.

571
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:05,134
I feel like I've been neglecting her.

572
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,400
Go away, bugs!

573
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,067
It's freezing. What are we doing now?

574
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,668
Let's go home.

575
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,934
You said you want to change for O Sol.

576
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:28,513
Is this the extent of your love?

577
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:31,202
Gosh, you're one petty quack.

578
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,701
So? What now?

579
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,901
What should I do?

580
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:38,233
I'm relieved...

581
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:42,001
...because you actually
seem like a nice guy.

582
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:44,880
Are you realizing it just now?

583
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:46,702
You're confident that you
won't make me regret...

584
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,801
...giving up on O Sol, right?

585
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
What are you talking about?

586
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,967
Please protect O Sol...

587
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:57,001
...no matter what.

588
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:01,801
I think all will be fine
if you don't give up.

589
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:07,579
Well, I don't think that's
any of your business.

590
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,101
I will never give up.

591
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:14,001
I'll be sure to protect O Sol
and keep her safe at all times.

592
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,468
That's why I'm here now.

593
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:19,868
And?

594
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,168
Are you enjoying it?

595
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:25,801
Not really.

596
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,634
But I should still do it.

597
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:32,767
I will do it.

598
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,734
Now,

599
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,067
I must.

600
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:46,867
So?

601
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,433
Where's the list of
the disciplinary committee members?

602
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,834
There's actually something
I need to tell you, sir.

603
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:58,334
Go ahead.

604
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:00,755
I don't think...

605
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,034
...I can work for you anymore.

606
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:08,880
I no longer want to do things that
Mr. Jang doesn't want.

607
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:10,168
Things...

608
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:11,700
...that he doesn't want?

609
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:15,168
Stop meddling in everything,
including the disciplinary hearing.

610
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,567
I kindly ask you...

611
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,967
...to stop giving Ms. Gil's
family a hard time.

612
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:24,669
She left the company voluntarily,
so I think...

613
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,434
...you should leave her alone.

614
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,559
Seon Gyeol is...

615
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:36,702
...going out with that girl, I hear.

616
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,168
It's between the two of them.

617
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,967
It's none of your business.

618
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:45,346
Why did you never tell me her mom died...

619
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,734
...in the Jungang-dong accident?

620
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:53,868
I'll protect Seon Gyeol...

621
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,534
...in my own way.

622
00:40:56,278 --> 00:40:57,155
All right.

623
00:40:58,437 --> 00:41:00,089
Thank you for all your help so far.

624
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,968
The disciplinary committee
will be held tomorrow, right?

625
00:41:12,634 --> 00:41:14,568
Don't be nervous. It'll be all right.

626
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:16,901
You came to say that?

627
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:19,667
No.

628
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:23,035
Take it back.

629
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:31,535
The first medal you win...

630
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:33,668
...after the disciplinary committee.

631
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,200
I want that.

632
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:39,312
You know how I am, right?

633
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,045
I'll only accept a gold medal.

634
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,734
You better work hard.

635
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,968
Are you serious?

636
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,579
Do you really mean it?

637
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:51,501
If I win a gold medal,
you'll go out with me?

638
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:54,134
We'll see.

639
00:41:55,901 --> 00:41:57,001
Guys!

640
00:41:58,868 --> 00:42:00,268
Let's go!

641
00:42:02,501 --> 00:42:04,768
I'll win a gold medal!

642
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:18,767
Come to the window.

643
00:42:37,634 --> 00:42:44,135
(I love you, O Sol.)

644
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,500
(I love you, O Sol.)

645
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,068
(You're the only one. You're so pretty.)

646
00:42:52,167 --> 00:42:53,646
(Look at me only. Let's walk together.)

647
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:54,934
(We'll always be together.)

648
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:02,467
Hello.

649
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:04,068
What's going on?

650
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,300
Hold on.

651
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:14,168
Are you outside?

652
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,868
No.

653
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:18,234
I'm right in front of you.

654
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,768
How did you come in?

655
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,367
Where are your gloves?

656
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,068
I opened the doors with bare hands.

657
00:43:29,834 --> 00:43:32,101
-I did some special training.
-Special training?

658
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,167
Are you okay?

659
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,901
I thought I'd be okay,

660
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,668
but I'm not.

661
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:50,167
I think I have to go out.

662
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:54,734
Come.

663
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:09,634
"Gil O Sol".

664
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,034
I'll go wash my hands now.

665
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:26,001
I'm proud of you.

666
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,168
Maybe I'll stay a bit longer.

667
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:00,768
Thank you for the security camera footage.

668
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:06,101
I'm sorry...

669
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,212
...that's the only thing I can do for you.

670
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,067
I've always wanted to ask you this.

671
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,834
What's the relationship
between you and Chairman Cha?

672
00:46:14,934 --> 00:46:17,902
I don't understand
why you would have wanted...

673
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:19,868
...to help him.

674
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:23,534
You've also been actively involved
with Seon Gyeol's surroundings.

675
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,834
Was that also for Chairman Cha's sake?

676
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,449
No.

677
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:30,556
It wasn't for his sake.

678
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:33,167
It was for my own sake.

679
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:37,834
To me, Mr. Jang meant my son's future.

680
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,468
I did the things I did to make
Mr. Jang happy.

681
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:45,934
But my judgment was wrong.

682
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,134
I only made things harder for him.

683
00:46:50,868 --> 00:46:53,012
By the way, tomorrow's
disciplinary committee...

684
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,780
...might not go very well.

685
00:46:54,868 --> 00:46:56,569
Why do you say that?

686
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:00,401
Chairman Cha found out about O Sol.

687
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,502
Even the fact that her mom died
in the Jungang-dong accident.

688
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,500
It seems like...

689
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:11,035
...he has decided to break up
Mr. Jang and O Sol.

690
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,783
To do that,

691
00:47:13,628 --> 00:47:15,489
he will use O Sol's family.

692
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:26,734
I'm Mr. Jang Seon Gyeol's doctor,
Choi Ha In.

693
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:31,235
Can I have a word with you, Chairman Cha?

694
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,730
So you have three months left at the most.

695
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:42,968
And you haven't even told your family.

696
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,442
If it gets out before the heir is decided,

697
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:51,868
AG Group will suffer immensely.

698
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:56,667
Are you blackmailing me?

699
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:01,702
Yes, it's just what you think it is.

700
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:03,567
I'm blackmailing you.

701
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:06,001
So what do you want?

702
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,402
You must have come to me...

703
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,401
...because there is something you want.

704
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,127
Leave O Sol's family alone.

705
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:19,702
When AG Group was redeveloping
Jungang-dong six years ago...

706
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:22,535
...your misjudgment...

707
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:25,300
...resulted in four casualties.

708
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:27,835
And I hear you're aware...

709
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:31,936
...that one of them is O Sol's mother.

710
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,068
Instead of apologizing
to the victims and their families,

711
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,433
you want to trample on
them for the second time?

712
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,701
To stop you,

713
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:44,634
I'd do something even
worse than blackmailing.

714
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:59,308
The disciplinary committee
is today, right?

715
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:02,331
Yes. But the result is already decided.

716
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:04,967
-I'm not so worried.
-That's good.

717
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:09,935
Do you want to come
to my place after work?

718
00:49:10,968 --> 00:49:12,135
We should celebrate.

719
00:49:13,501 --> 00:49:14,701
That's unnecessary.

720
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:16,320
Should we get a cake?

721
00:49:16,736 --> 00:49:18,089
Should we cook something nice?

722
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:21,567
It's raining.

723
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,446
I hung the laundry outside.

724
00:49:23,534 --> 00:49:25,468
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

725
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:36,300
I took care of it for you.

726
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,600
Thank you.

727
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,434
I thought you went to O Dol's
disciplinary committee.

728
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:55,268
He threw a fit, saying there
was no need for me to go.

729
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:57,767
I wonder how it's going.

730
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:02,834
I'm glad O Dol can start
his training again.

731
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:11,635
About those receipts...

732
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,701
The ones you said my dad left behind.

733
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:14,801
Yes.

734
00:50:14,901 --> 00:50:16,968
My dad said he never went there.

735
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:25,048
Is there something you are hiding from me?

736
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:28,079
No, I'm not hiding anything.

737
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,200
By any chance,

738
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,334
are you...

739
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:37,801
...the one who leaves yogurt behind...

740
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,367
...for me?

741
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:48,913
Yes.

742
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,372
You're right.

743
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,034
It's me who left the yogurt.

744
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,234
Really?

745
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:01,601
Why?

746
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,234
A long time ago,

747
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:06,968
there was a time you gave me yogurt once.

748
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,434
Here. Drink this.

749
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,034
Drink it when it's still cold.

750
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:26,701
That yogurt...

751
00:51:27,234 --> 00:51:28,868
...provided me with solace too.

752
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:32,300
I received solace...

753
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:34,968
...but you didn't.

754
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:37,652
That's why.

755
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,180
From that moment on,

756
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:44,302
you and your family
were always on my mind.

757
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:47,868
I want to stay with Mr. Gil,

758
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:49,934
you, and O Dol.

759
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:53,402
I know I won't be much help,

760
00:51:54,267 --> 00:51:55,868
but can I stay here like this?

761
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,267
If you allow me to,

762
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,533
I want to help.

763
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:02,634
No matter what it is.

764
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,479
(Disciplinary Committee)

765
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:18,801
We hereby give Gil O Dol
of the taekwondo club...

766
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:21,035
...of Dong Myeong High School...

767
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,267
...a one-year suspension
from practicing taekwondo.

768
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,033
What?

769
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,713
What? One year?

770
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,279
I think there's been a mistake.

771
00:52:32,367 --> 00:52:34,834
You saw that it was
an act of self-defense.

772
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,233
Sir... Sir!

773
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,300
I'm sure there's been a mistake.

774
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,613
I'll talk to the coach...

775
00:52:57,701 --> 00:52:59,935
...and find out what's happening...

776
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:02,367
-...so don't worry...
-About O Dol's disciplinary action.

777
00:53:02,534 --> 00:53:04,135
Isn't it a bit too harsh?

778
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:07,279
What's his relationship with AG Group?

779
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:08,544
Didn't you hear?

780
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:12,102
There's a rumor his sister is
dating the grandson of AG Group.

781
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:13,867
Is that true?

782
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,012
You didn't know?

783
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,267
What did you just say?

784
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:17,423
"AG Group"?

785
00:53:17,512 --> 00:53:18,912
-O Dol.
-You just said AG.

786
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:20,546
What are you talking about?

787
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:22,179
I'm sorry.

788
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:24,068
Hey. Mister.

789
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:28,134
Dad, what were they talking about?

790
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,701
I received solace...

791
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,302
...but you didn't.

792
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:31,212
You're back. How did it go?

793
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,700
Can you continue your training?

794
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,734
Why are you all wet?

795
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:42,679
What?

796
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:44,219
Did something go wrong?

797
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:56,805
Dad.

798
00:54:58,187 --> 00:54:59,521
Why him?

799
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,945
What do you mean?

800
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,734
Why that jerk?

801
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:11,809
Didn't you know
he's the grandson of AG Group?

802
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,668
Why that jerk?

803
00:55:15,633 --> 00:55:16,766
Why him of all people?

804
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:19,461
Why must you date a guy from the family...

805
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,451
...that killed your mom? Why?

806
00:55:25,275 --> 00:55:27,068
AG? What do you mean?

807
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:30,766
Mr. Jang is...

808
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:33,302
...a family member of AG Group?

809
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,767
That can't be true.

810
00:55:39,434 --> 00:55:40,935
How can...

811
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:48,868
Not only did they kill your mom,

812
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:52,834
but now they're trying to ruin
your brother's life as well.

813
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:57,535
Those jerks are about
to ruin your brother too.

814
00:55:58,734 --> 00:56:00,001
Goodness.

815
00:56:48,434 --> 00:56:49,601
You're late.

816
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,379
What... What happened?

817
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:58,115
Why are you all wet?

818
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,701
Let's stop meeting each other.

819
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:06,557
What?

820
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:09,993
Let's break up.

821
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:17,501
What are you talking about?

822
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,667
Is something wrong?

823
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:24,813
Come in first.

824
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:26,301
It's cold. You'll catch a cold.

825
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:37,135
I said I wanted to break up.

826
00:57:38,868 --> 00:57:39,935
Let's break up.

827
00:57:42,734 --> 00:57:45,034
Why on earth are you doing this?

828
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:49,334
You sounded fine when we talked
on the phone this afternoon.

829
00:57:52,801 --> 00:57:55,769
Did I do something wrong?

830
00:57:57,901 --> 00:57:59,802
If you're upset... No.

831
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:04,479
If you're mad at me, please tell me.

832
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:07,846
That way, I can fix it
or do anything I can.

833
00:58:07,934 --> 00:58:10,301
What is this so out of the blue?

834
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,667
You did nothing wrong.

835
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,567
I just...

836
00:58:17,934 --> 00:58:19,635
I just got sick of everything.

837
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:25,001
I can't even stand the sight of you.

838
00:58:26,734 --> 00:58:27,901
Let's end it here.

839
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:54,702
The number you've dialed cannot
be reached. Please leave...

840
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,034
(Call me when you get this message.)

841
01:01:04,868 --> 01:01:06,868
Please leave a message after the tone.

842
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,967
Additional charges may apply...

843
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,868
Please leave a message after the tone.

844
01:01:15,151 --> 01:01:17,934
Ms. Gil, let's talk.

845
01:01:19,868 --> 01:01:21,901
Pick up your phone, please.

846
01:01:29,868 --> 01:01:31,935
First message.

847
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:36,135
Ms. Gil, let's talk.

848
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,535
Pick up your phone, please.

849
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,869
The message has been deleted.

850
01:02:03,367 --> 01:02:04,934
How dare you!

851
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:07,307
-My gosh.
-Stop!

852
01:02:07,434 --> 01:02:09,567
-Wait, stop!
-Step aside!

853
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,400
No, let go!

854
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:17,133
No! Stop!

855
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:19,834
Stop it!

856
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,768
Bring my wife back to life.

857
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,613
Bring my wife back to life, you murderer!

858
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:54,302
Bring her back. Bring her back to life!

859
01:02:57,334 --> 01:02:59,112
Dad! Dad!

860
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,300
Are you all right? Are you okay?

861
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,300
How dare you show up here?

862
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,500
This isn't a good idea, sir.

863
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:09,102
-We should leave.
-That scumbag!

864
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:13,701
-Get away!
-My goodness.

865
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:16,668
How could he have the
audacity to show up here?

866
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:15,768
I'm going to work.

867
01:04:19,934 --> 01:04:21,401
Make sure you eat something.

868
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:27,734
Don't make me worry about you as well.

869
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:50,301
Father.

870
01:04:58,434 --> 01:05:00,181
Father, I can't get a hold of O Sol.

871
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:02,335
Is she home now by any chance?

872
01:05:02,434 --> 01:05:04,701
Who said you could call me "Father"?

873
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,070
Pardon me?

874
01:05:11,062 --> 01:05:12,563
Do not come here ever again.

875
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:16,305
You'd better stay far away from O Sol.

876
01:05:40,252 --> 01:05:43,173
I must've done something
majorly wrong to O Sol,

877
01:05:45,085 --> 01:05:46,719
but I can't figure out what it is.

878
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,037
I want to apologize to her in person.

879
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:56,534
But in all honesty,
I'm not sure what I should be...

880
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,134
...apologizing for.

881
01:06:03,033 --> 01:06:05,600
I've tried calling and texting,
but she's not getting back to me.

882
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,133
It's been days.

883
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,301
I can't even work because I'm so worried.

884
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:23,834
Do you know if she's home now?

885
01:06:23,923 --> 01:06:25,590
She's not sick, right?

886
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:29,201
She's fine, but she is...

887
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:32,234
...going through a hard time.

888
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,101
This must be hard for you as well...

889
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,667
...but why don't you...

890
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:41,468
...just give her some time?

891
01:06:41,834 --> 01:06:43,934
I think that will be the best...

892
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,133
...for both of your sakes.

893
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:51,312
What I'm saying is, I want to know...

894
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,201
...why I have to do that.
I mean...

895
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:56,068
...I need to know the reason.

896
01:06:59,634 --> 01:07:01,301
I saw her dad earlier.

897
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,168
I've never seen him treat
me that way before.

898
01:07:05,534 --> 01:07:08,834
He seemed very angry
at me for some reason,

899
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:13,701
but I can't figure out why.

900
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:29,133
O Sol.

901
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:47,634
O Sol.

902
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,613
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)

903
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:36,546
You should tell me
why you're suddenly acting like this.

904
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:37,634
I have nothing to say.

905
01:08:37,968 --> 01:08:38,968
O Sol.

906
01:08:39,567 --> 01:08:41,068
O Sol!

907
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,579
I don't need any of this.

908
01:08:42,667 --> 01:08:45,101
A doctor, or treating my mysophobia...

909
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:46,379
I won't do it.

910
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:49,579
You are the one who made
Seon Gyeol like that. You!

911
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,813
He's starting to wash more frequently.

912
01:08:51,901 --> 01:08:54,479
I'm afraid Mr. Jang might be in danger.

913
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:57,679
I won't run away, or avoid it anymore.

914
01:08:57,767 --> 01:08:58,817
Please get out of my way.

915
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:00,621
I need to go see Mr. Jang.

916
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:15,985
(Clean with Passion for Now!!)
